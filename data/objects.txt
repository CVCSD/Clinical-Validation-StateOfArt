35072816#ABSTRACT##In clinical practice,, assessing digital health literacy is important to identify patients who may encounter difficulties adapting to digital health using digital technology and service. We developed the Digital Health Technology Literacy Assessment Questionnaire (DHTL-AQ) to assess the ability to use digital health technology,, services,, and data. The DHTL-AQ was developed in three phases. In the first phase,, the conceptual framework and domains and items were generated from a systematic literature review using relevant theory and surveys. In the second phase,, a cross-sectional survey with 590 adults age?=?18 years was conducted at an academic hospital in Seoul,, Korea in January and February 2020 to test face validity of the items. Then,, psychometric validation was conducted to determine the final items and cut-off scores of the DHTL-AQ. The eHealth literacy scale,, the Newest Vital Sign,, and 10 mobile app task ability assessments were examined to test validity. The final DHTL-AQ includes 34 items in two domains (digital functional and digital critical literacy) and 4 categories (Information and Communications Technology terms,, Information and Communications Technology icons,, use of an app,, evaluating reliability and relevance of health information). The DHTL-AQ had excellent internal consistency (overall Cronbach's a?=?0.95; 0.87-0.94 for subtotals) and acceptable model fit (CFI?=?0.821,, TLI?=?0.807,, SRMR?=?0.065,, RMSEA?=?0.090). The DHTL-AQ was highly correlated with task ability assessment (r?=?0.7591),, and moderately correlated with the eHealth literacy scale (r?=?0.5265) and the Newest Vital Sign (r?=?0.5929). The DHTL-AQ is a reliable and valid instrument to measure digital health technology literacy.

34827518#ABSTRACT##For incurable diseases,, such as multiple sclerosis (MS),, the prevention of progression and the preservation of quality of life play a crucial role over the entire therapy period. In MS,, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore,, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes,, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here,, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used,, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects,, disease activity and response to therapy,, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers-digital health technologies-to explain,, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad,, and range from wearables that collect patients' activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g.,, the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test,, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g.,, optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesaving way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time,, not only once or twice a year during patients' routine visit at the clinic. Therefore,, they lead to real-life data acquisition,, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization,, for now,, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation,, infrastructure,, evidence generation,, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review,, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS,, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this,, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS,, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach.

32452840#ABSTRACT##Pathology has benefited from advanced innovation with novel technology to implement a digital solution. Whole slide imaging is a disruptive technology where glass slides are scanned to produce digital images. There have been significant advances in whole slide scanning hardware and software that have allowed for ready access of whole slide images. The digital images,, or whole slide images,, can be viewed comparable to glass slides in a microscope,, as digital files. Whole slide imaging has increased in adoption among pathologists,, pathology departments,, and scientists for clinical,, educational,, and research initiatives. Worldwide usage of whole slide imaging has grown significantly. Pathology regulatory organizations (ie,, College of American Pathologists) have put forth guidelines for clinical validation,, and the US Food and Drug Administration have also approved whole slide imaging for primary diagnosis. This article will review the digital pathology ecosystem and discuss clinical and nonclinical applications of its use.
31905322#ABSTRACT##Disease surveillance systems are a cornerstone of public health tracking and prevention. This review addresses the use,, promise,, perils,, and ethics of social media- and Internet-based data collection for public health surveillance. Our review highlights untapped opportunities for integrating digital surveillance in public health and current applications that could be improved through better integration,, validation,, and clarity on rules surrounding ethical considerations. Promising developments include hybrid systems that couple traditional surveillance data with data from search queries,, social media posts,, and crowdsourcing. In the future,, it will be important to identify opportunities for public and private partnerships,, train public health experts in data science,, reduce biases related to digital data (gathered from Internet use,, wearable devices,, etc.),, and address privacy. We are on the precipice of an unprecedented opportunity to track,, predict,, and prevent global disease burdens in the population using digital data.

31429410#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital health is poised to transform health care and redefine personalized health. As Internet and mobile phone usage increases,, as technology develops new ways to collect data,, and as clinical guidelines change,, all areas of medicine face new challenges and opportunities. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of many chronic diseases that may benefit from these advances in digital health. This review intends to lay a foundation for clinicians and technologists to understand future directions and opportunities together.
31429410#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This review covers mobile health apps that have been used in IBD,, how they have fit into a clinical care framework,, and the challenges that clinicians and technologists face in approaching future opportunities.
31429410#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched PubMed,, Scopus,, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify mobile apps that have been studied and were published in the literature from January 1,, 2010,, to April 19,, 2019. The search terms were ("mobile health" OR "eHealth" OR "digital health" OR "smart phone" OR "mobile app" OR "mobile applications" OR "mHealth" OR "smartphones") AND ("IBD" OR "Inflammatory bowel disease" OR "Crohn's Disease" (CD) OR "Ulcerative Colitis" (UC) OR "UC" OR "CD"),, followed by further analysis of citations from the results. We searched the Apple iTunes app store to identify a limited selection of commercial apps to include for discussion.
30153922#AUTHOR#1#Department of Paediatrics,, University of Oxford,, Oxford,, UK. Electronic address: Michelle.vanvelthoven@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk.
31429410#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A total of 11 digital health apps were identified in the literature and 4 commercial apps were selected to be described in this review. While most apps have some educational component,, the majority of apps focus on eliciting patient-reported outcomes related to disease activity,, and a few are for treatment management. Significant benefits have been seen in trials relating to education,, quality of life,, quality of care,, treatment adherence,, and medication management. No studies have reported a negative impact on any of the above. There are mixed results in terms of effects on office visits and follow-up.
31429410#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#While studies have shown that digital health can fit into,, complement,, and improve the standard clinical care of patients with IBD,, there is a need for further validation and improvement,, from both a clinical and patient perspective. Exploring new research methods,, like microrandomized trials,, may allow for more implementation of technology and rapid advancement of knowledge. New technologies that can objectively and seamlessly capture remote data,, as well as complement the clinical shift from symptom-based to inflammation-based care,, will help the clinical and health technology communities to understand the full potential of digital health in the care of IBD and other chronic illnesses.

32217503#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Effective treatment of hypertension requires careful self-management. With the ongoing development of mobile technologies and the scarcity of health care resources,, mobile health (mHealth)-based self-management has become a useful treatment for hypertension,, and its effectiveness has been assessed in many trials. However,, there is a paucity of comprehensive summaries of the studies using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
32217503#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review aimed to measure the effectiveness of mHealth in improving the self-management of hypertension for adults. The outcome measures were blood pressure (BP),, BP control,, medication adherence,, self-management behavior,, and costs.

32217503#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search was conducted using 5 electronic databases. The snowballing method was used to scan the reference lists of relevant studies. Only peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2010 and September 2019 were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by 3 researchers independently,, adhering to the validation guideline and checklist. Both a meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis were carried out.
32217503#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 24 studies with 8933 participants were included. Of these,, 23 studies reported the clinical outcome of BP,, 12 of these provided systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data,, and 16 articles focused on change in self-management behavior and medication adherence. All 24 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. According to the meta-analysis,, a greater reduction in both SBP and DBP was observed in the mHealth intervention groups compared with control groups,, -3.78 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI -4.67 to -2.89) and -1.57 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI -2.28 to -0.86),, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed consistent reductions in SBP and DBP across different frequencies of reminders,, interactive patterns,, intervention functions,, and study duration subgroups. A total of 16 studies reported better medication adherence and behavioral change in the intervention groups,, while 8 showed no significant change. Six studies included an economic evaluation,, which drew inconsistent conclusions. However,, potentially long-term financial benefits were mentioned in all economic evaluations. All studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias.
32217503#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This review found that mHealth self-management interventions were effective in BP control. The outcomes of this review showed improvements in self-management behavior and medication adherence. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored messages,, interactive communication,, and multifaceted functions. Further research with longer duration and cultural adaptation is necessary. With increasing disease burden from hypertension globally,, mHealth offers a potentially effective method for self-management and control of BP. mHealth can be easily integrated into existing health care systems.

34914614#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and costly condition that is usually accompanied by multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes,, hypertension,, and obesity. Proper management of CKD can delay or prevent kidney failure and help mitigate cardiovascular disease risk,, which increases as kidney function declines. Smart device apps hold potential to enhance patient self-management of chronic conditions including CKD.
34914614#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to develop a mobile app to facilitate self-management of nondialysis-dependent CKD.
34914614#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Our stakeholder team included 4 patients with stage 3-4 nondialysis-dependent CKD; a kidney transplant recipient; a caretaker; CKD care providers (pharmacists,, a nurse,, primary care physicians,, a nephrologist,, and a cardiologist); 2 health services and CKD researchers; a researcher in biomedical informatics,, nutrition,, and obesity; a system developer; and 2 programmers. Focus groups and in-person interviews with the patients and providers were conducted using a focus group and interview guide based on existing literature on CKD self-management and the mobile app quality criteria from the Mobile App Rating Scale. Qualitative analytic methods including the constant comparative method were used to analyze the focus group and interview data.
34914614#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Patients and providers identified and discussed a list of requirements and preferences regarding the content,, features,, and technical aspects of the mobile app,, which are unique for CKD self-management. Requirements and preferences centered along themes of communication between patients and caregivers,, partnership in care,, self-care activities,, adherence to treatment regimens,, and self-care self-efficacy. These identified themes informed the features and content of our mobile app. The mobile app user can enter health data including blood pressure,, weight,, and blood glucose levels. Symptoms and their severity can also be entered,, and users are prompted to contact a physician as indicated by the symptom and its severity. Next,, mobile app users can select biweekly goals from a set of predetermined goals with the option to enter customized goals. The user can also keep a list of medications and track medication use. Our app includes feedback mechanisms where in-range values for health data are depicted in green and out-of-range values are depicted in red. We ensured that data entered by patients could be downloaded into a user-friendly report,, which could be emailed or uploaded to an electronic health record. The mobile app also includes a mechanism that allows either group or individualized video chat meetings with a provider to facilitate either group support,, education,, or even virtual clinic visits. The CKD app also includes educational material on CKD and its symptoms.
34914614#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Patients with CKD and CKD care providers believe that a mobile app can enhance CKD self-management by facilitating patient-provider communication and enabling self-care activities including treatment adherence.

30153922#ABSTRACT##Health apps have great potential to improve the quality of care and reduce costs,, but this has not yet been achieved. Unfortunately,, there are many low-quality,, unsafe health apps,, resulting in different types of risks. This Perspective addresses the current failure to adopt standards for the development and implementation of health apps. For each theoretical stage of the app development lifecycle we discuss problems,, examples,, reasons,, and solutions. We believe that adapted versions of existing professional and technical standards and tools developed for clinical information systems,, medical devices and medicines could help mitigate risks throughout the health app lifecycle. Adapted standards should bring more effective user involvement and cooperation amongst stakeholders. We argue that these efforts will ultimately provide users with a wider choice of higher-quality health apps,, give healthcare providers access to better quality data,, and allow developers to innovate without unnecessary time-consuming restrictions.

33512395#ABSTRACT##The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an overwhelming impact on both clinical practices and learning environments. On March 17th,, 2020,, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation issued a statement recommending a "pause" in medical student participation in-person at clinical sites. In response,, the Family Medicine Department at the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine recognized the need to evolve the traditional curriculum and quickly transitioned to an online format,, incorporating telemedicine into the clerkship. This new model enabled 44 third-year medical students to obtain high-quality,, offsite,, virtual education and learn new skills.

25760773#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of mobile apps for health and well being promotion has grown exponentially in recent years. Yet,, there is currently no app-quality assessment tool beyond "star"-ratings.
25760773#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to develop a reliable,, multidimensional measure for trialling,, classifying,, and rating the quality of mobile health apps.
25760773#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A literature search was conducted to identify articles containing explicit Web or app quality rating criteria published between January 2000 and January 2013. Existing criteria for the assessment of app quality were categorized by an expert panel to develop the new Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) subscales,, items,, descriptors,, and anchors. There were sixty well being apps that were randomly selected using an iTunes search for MARS rating. There were ten that were used to pilot the rating procedure,, and the remaining 50 provided data on interrater reliability.
25760773#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There were 372 explicit criteria for assessing Web or app quality that were extracted from 25 published papers,, conference proceedings,, and Internet resources. There were five broad categories of criteria that were identified including four objective quality scales: engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, and information quality; and one subjective quality scale; which were refined into the 23-item MARS. The MARS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (alpha = .90) and interrater reliability intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = .79).
25760773#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MARS is a simple,, objective,, and reliable tool for classifying and assessing the quality of mobile health apps. It can also be used to provide a checklist for the design and development of new high quality health apps.

35087160#ABSTRACT##In recent years,, the number of digital health tools with the potential to significantly improve delivery of healthcare services has grown tremendously. However,, the use of these tools in large,, complex health systems remains comparatively limited. The adoption and implementation of digital health tools at an enterprise level is a challenge; few strategies exist to help tools cross the chasm from clinical validation to integration within the workflows of a large health system. Many previously proposed frameworks for digital health implementation are difficult to operationalize in these dynamic organizations. In this piece,, we put forth nine dimensions along which clinically validated digital health tools should be examined by health systems prior to adoption,, and propose strategies for selecting digital health tools and planning for implementation in this setting. By evaluating prospective tools along these dimensions,, health systems can evaluate which existing digital health solutions are worthy of adoption,, ensure they have sufficient resources for deployment and long-term use,, and devise a strategic plan for implementation.

31327518#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health applications may improve patient education and self-care for a complex condition such as atrial fibrillation (AF). Little is known about the accessibility of mobile health applications ("apps") and their readability. We evaluated the readability and quality of available apps for AF.
31327518#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched the Apple and Google Play app stores with the terms "atrial fibrillation" and "afib." We downloaded English-language apps (up to n?=?100 for each term) and categorized them by name,, App store,, cost,, content,, uploading agency (heath care associated [HCA] versus non-HCA),, target audience (health care professional [HCP] versus non-HCP),, scientific validity (i.e.,, citation of peer-reviewed or validated medical information),, and user ratings. We analyzed the text of apps intended for a non-HCP target audience for readability with 10 established measures.
31327518#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 206 downloaded apps,, 50.5% were excluded as unrelated to AF,, inaccessible,, or non-English language. The majority of apps contained information about AF (63.2% Apple,, 52.2% Google Play) and AF detection (52.6% Apple,, 56.5% Google Play). A minority of non-HCP apps contained scientifically validated content (Apple,, 15.8%; Google Play,, 13.0%; P?=?NS). App mean readability was grade 12.1?±?2.6.
31327518#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Most AF apps lacked scientific validation and were written at excessively high reading-grade levels. Our results suggest caution with mobile health apps,, particularly for users with limited health literacy. There is potential opportunity for a multi-disciplinary effort by regulatory agencies,, healthcare organizations,, and app stores to improve relevance,, scientific validity,, and readability of AF apps for patients with this complex and morbid disease.

31282755#ABSTRACT##Introduction: Telemonitoring of hypertension in pregnancy is becoming increasingly common. Several small studies have described the potential benefits of patient-led remote monitoring,, including fewer hospital visits,, better blood pressure control,, and cost savings. Areas covered: This review summarises the principles of prenatal remote monitoring of hypertension as well as the types of devices and applications currently in use. We summarise current evidence regarding the potential benefits and pitfalls with respect to outcomes for mothers,, neonates and wider population health. Core topics for ongoing and future research are discussed,, with special emphasis on feasibility and validation of technologies,, methodological standardization,, patient safety,, privacy and acceptability,, and health economics and governance. Expert opinion: Telemonitoring of hypertension in pregnancy is likely to become commonplace in the next five to ten years and research now must be directed to ensure it is used in the safest way before its general introduction into daily clinical practice can be recommended. Raising women's awareness of their health condition could improve both pregnancy and long-term health outcomes.

34713173#ABSTRACT##Mental health disorders are complex disorders of the nervous system characterized by a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Mental illness is of particular concern for younger people. The WHO estimates that around 20% of the world's children and adolescents have a mental health condition,, a rate that is almost double compared to the general population. One approach toward mitigating the medical and socio-economic effects of mental health disorders is leveraging the power of digital health technology to deploy assistive,, preventative,, and therapeutic solutions for people in need. We define "digital mental health" as any application of digital health technology for mental health assessment,, support,, prevention,, and treatment. However,, there is only limited evidence that digital mental health tools can be successfully implemented in clinical settings. Authors have pointed to a lack of technical and medical standards for digital mental health apps,, personalized neurotechnology,, and assistive cognitive technology as a possible cause of suboptimal adoption and implementation in the clinical setting. Further,, ethical concerns have been raised related to insufficient effectiveness,, lack of adequate clinical validation,, and user-centered design as well as data privacy vulnerabilities of current digital mental health products. The aim of this paper is to report on a scoping review we conducted to capture and synthesize the growing literature on the promises and ethical challenges of digital mental health for young people aged 0-25. This review seeks to survey the scope and focus of the relevant literature,, identify major benefits and opportunities of ethical significance (e.g.,, reducing suffering and improving well-being),, and provide a comprehensive mapping of the emerging ethical challenges. Our findings provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature and offer a detailed informative basis for any stakeholder involved in the development,, deployment,, and management of ethically-aligned digital mental health solutions for young people.

33459666#ABSTRACT##Digital health technology (DHT),, including wearable and environmental sensors,, video cameras and other electronic tools,, has provided new opportunities for the measurement of movement and functionality in Parkinson's disease. Compared to current standards for evaluation of the disease (MDS-UPDRS),, DHT may offer new possibilities for more frequent objective measurements of the duration,, severity and frequency of disease manifestations over time,, that may provide more information than periodic clinic visits. However,, DHT measurements are only scientifically and medically useful if they are accurate,, reliable and clinically meaningful. Verification and validation,, also known as analytical validation and clinical validation,, of DHT performance is important to ensure the accuracy and precision of measurements,, and the specificity of findings. Given the wide range of clinical manifestations associated with Parkinson's disease and the many tools and metrics to assess them,, the challenge is to identify those that may represent a standard for use in clinical trials,, and to confirm when digital measurements succeed or fall short of capturing meaningful benefits during drug development.
33957179#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This scoping review of available apps in the iOS and Android app stores uses an in-house-developed tool (scraper https://holtder.github.io/talos) to systematically aggregate available apps relevant for HAI prevention. The apps are evaluated on functionality,, assessed on quality using the 'Mobile Application Rating Scale' (MARS),, and assessed on potential use in clinical infection prevention.
33957179#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#Using the scraper with CDC HAI topics through 146 search terms resulted in 92,,726 potentially relevant apps,, of which 28 apps met the inclusion criteria. The majority of these apps have the functionality to inform (27 of 28 apps) or to instruct (20/28). MARS scores for the 28 apps were high in the following domains: functionality (4.19/5),, aesthetics (3.49/5),, and information (3.74/5),, with relatively low scores in engagement (2.97/5),, resulting in a good average score (3.57/5).
33957179#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Low engagement scores restrict apps that intend to inform or instruct,, possibly explained by the often-academic nature of the development of these apps. Although the number of HAI prevention apps increased by 60% in 5 years,, the proportion of clinically relevant apps is limited. The variation in HAI app quality and lack of user engagement,, could be improved by co-creation and development in the clinical setting.

35063184#ABSTRACT##The value of comprehensive oncology management including supportive care is well established,, but it remains challenged by the increasing need and access disparities. By enabling real-time,, dynamic,, technology-assisted assessments and interventions,, e-health is a key for optimizing supportive care in Oncology in 2021. Indeed,, e-health has the potential to improve communication between the patient and the healthcare professional,, improve the assessment and management of symptoms and toxicities,, and optimize patient engagement across the continuum of care. We are witnessing a new era of patient-centered care,, where the patient becomes an actor in his or her own care. In this review,, we present the definitions and the French legal framework of e-health,, and some currently available e-health solutions in oncology focused on supportive care,, including the issues of their validation and financing. We will also discuss the challenges and access for patients,, as well as the issues of access,, security and transfer of health data.

35742288#ABSTRACT##The paradigm of value-based health care is spreading worldwide; however,, Value-Based Digital Health (VBDH) is still an emerging concept. VBDH is understood as the use of digital tools to facilitate the generation of value in health. It is accelerated by technological change,, cultural,, and organizational factors. An accurate diagnosis of the organizational VBDH maturity is crucial to define and implement strategic actions to progress with VBDH transformation. This study aimed to validate a VBDH questionnaire,, which measures the degree of maturity of VBDH from the perspective of managers (N = 146) in Spanish healthcare organizations. Results show good internal consistency of the questionnaire. Factor analysis identified seven dimensions to measure VBHC maturity: (1) Resources,, incentives,, and financing; (2) Knowledge and participation of patients and workers in the strategy of progress towards VBDH; (3) Training of professionals and tool knowledge for advancement in VBDH; (4) Innovation initiatives; (5) Information and its quality; (6) Leadership,, strategy and governance; and (7) Knowledge of the fundamentals and objectives,, as well as access to relevant VBDH information. The questionnaire presents good validity and internal consistency and meets the requirements to be an instrument for routine use to assess VBDH organizational maturity.
33251474#ABSTRACT##Speech represents a promising novel biomarker by providing a window into brain health,, as shown by its disruption in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. As with many novel digital biomarkers,, however,, rigorous evaluation is currently lacking and is required for these measures to be used effectively and safely. This paper outlines and provides examples from the literature of evaluation steps for speech-based digital biomarkers,, based on the recent V3 framework (Goldsack et al.,, 2020). The V3 framework describes 3 components of evaluation for digital biomarkers: verification,, analytical validation,, and clinical validation. Verification includes assessing the quality of speech recordings and comparing the effects of hardware and recording conditions on the integrity of the recordings. Analytical validation includes checking the accuracy and reliability of data processing and computed measures,, including understanding test-retest reliability,, demographic variability,, and comparing measures to reference standards. Clinical validity involves verifying the correspondence of a measure to clinical outcomes which can include diagnosis,, disease progression,, or response to treatment. For each of these sections,, we provide recommendations for the types of evaluation necessary for speech-based biomarkers and review published examples. The examples in this paper focus on speech-based biomarkers,, but they can be used as a template for digital biomarker development more generally.

36314391#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Integration of environmentally sustainable digital health interventions requires robust evaluation of their carbon emission life-cycle before implementation in healthcare. This scoping review surveys the evidence on available environmental assessment frameworks,, methods,, and tools to evaluate the carbon footprint of digital health interventions for environmentally sustainable healthcare.
36314391#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#Medline (Ovid),, Embase (Ovid). PsycINFO (Ovid),, CINAHL,, Web of Science,, Scopus (which indexes IEEE Xplore,, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science and ACM databases),, Compendex,, and Inspec databases were searched with no time or language constraints. The Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA_SCR),, Joanna Briggs Scoping Review Framework,, and template for intervention description and replication (TiDiER) checklist were used to structure and report the findings.
36314391#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From 3299 studies screened,, data was extracted from 13 full-text studies. No standardised methods or validated tools were identified to systematically determine the environmental sustainability of a digital health intervention over its full life-cycle from conception to realisation. Most studies (n?=?8) adapted publicly available carbon calculators to estimate telehealth travel-related emissions. Others adapted these tools to examine the environmental impact of electronic health records (n?=?2),, e-prescriptions and e-referrals (n?=?1),, and robotic surgery (n?=?1). One study explored optimising the information system electricity consumption of telemedicine. No validated systems-based approach to evaluation and validation of digital health interventions could be identified.
36314391#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#There is a need to develop standardised,, validated methods and tools for healthcare environments to assist stakeholders to make informed decisions about reduction of carbon emissions from digital health interventions.

35124876#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health literacy is an important skill to deal with information and positively influences individual and community health. Information concerning health is available from a plethora of online resources. The concept of digital health literacy has gained prominence with the pandemic. The absence of valid tools to analyse digital literacy levels are scant. This study aims to translate,, adapt and validate the Portuguese version of the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI) as used in the global COVID-HL Network.
35124876#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants were mostly students from social sciences,, psychology,, education and health sciences. The Portuguese version of the DHLI contained five dimensions each consisting of three items. An online survey with university students (n = 1815,, 75.1% female,, average age: 24.15 years) was administered to test the validity of the Portuguese version of the DHLI. Data were analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Pearson correlations were also studied.
35124876#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Two items revealed symmetry and kurtosis problems. We chose to eliminate them from the analysis. Different exploratory factor analysis attempts were made,, obtaining two possible models to be tested in the confirmatory factor analysis: a three-factor model and a four-factor model. A four-factor structure of the instrument (information searching,, adding self-generated content,, evaluating reliability,, determining relevance) was supported by confirmatory factor analysis and had good internal consistency.
35124876#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Portuguese version of the Digital Health Literacy Instrument met adequate psychometric criteria. Therefore,, it can be confidently used in Portuguese students' assessment of digital health literacy. Representative studies are needed to shed light on different target groups and their COVID-19-related DHLI.

36857125#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Women's menstrual cycle is an important component of their overall health. Physiological cycles and associated symptoms can be monitored continuously and used as indicators in various fields. Menstrual apps are accessible and can be used to promote overall female health. However,, no study has evaluated these apps' functionality from both consumers' and health care providers' perspectives. As such,, the evidence indicating whether the menstrual apps available on the market provide user satisfaction is insufficient.
36857125#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study was performed to investigate the key content and quality of menstrual apps from the perspectives of health care providers and consumers. We also analyzed the correlations between health care provider and consumer evaluation scores. On the basis of this analysis,, we offer technical and policy recommendations that could increase the usability and convenience of future app.
36857125#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched the Google Play Store and iOS App Store using the keywords "period" and "menstrual cycle" in English and Korean and identified relevant apps. An app that met the following inclusion criteria was selected as a research app: nonduplicate; with >10,,000 reviews; last updated =180 days ago; relevant to this topic; written in Korean or English; available free of charge; and currently operational. App quality was evaluated by 6 consumers and 4 health care providers using Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). We then analyzed the correlations among MARS scores,, uMARS scores,, star ratings,, and the number of reviews.
36857125#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 34 apps,, 31 (91%) apps could be used to predict the menstrual cycle,, and 2 (6%) apps provided information pertinent to health screening. All apps that scored highly in the MARS evaluation offer a symptom logging function and provide the user with personalized notifications. The "Bom Calendar" app had the highest MARS (4.51) and uMARS (4.23) scores. The MARS (2.22) and uMARS (4.15) scores for the "Menstrual calendar-ovulation & pregnancy calendar" app were different. In addition,, there was no relationship between MARS and uMARS scores (r=0.32; P=.06).
36857125#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We compared consumer and health care provider ratings for menstrual apps. Continuous monitoring of app quality from consumer and health care provider perspectives is necessary to guide their development and update content.

30894100#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Remote monitoring devices for four areas of prenatal care are reported: (1) cardio-tocography; (2) blood glucose levels; (3) blood pressure; and (4) prenatal ultrasound. The majority of publications are pilot projects on remote consultation,, education,, coaching,, screening,, monitoring and selective booking,, mostly reporting potential medical and/or economic benefits by mobile health applications over conventional care for very specific situations,, indications and locations,, but not always generalizable.
30894100#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the potential advantages of these devices,, some caution must be taken when implementing this technology into routine daily practice. To date,, the majority of published research on mobile health in the prenatal setting consists of observational studies and there is a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials to confirm the reported clinical and economic benefits as well as the safety of this technology. There is also a need for guidance and governance on the development and validation of new apps and devices and for the implementation of mobile health technology into healthcare systems in both high and low-income settings. Finally,, digital communication technologies offer perspectives towards exploration and development of the very new domain of tele-pharmacology.

34533468#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The increasing use of smartphones by providers and patients alike demonstrates that digital health utilizing mobile applications has the potential to transform perioperative care and education in anesthesia.
34533468#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This literature review describes the current scope of the use of mobile applications in anesthesiology.
34533468#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Literature was searched using PubMed,, Scopus,, and clinicaltrials.gov for articles published from January 1,, 2010,, through April 1,, 2020. Only English language studies were included. Articles were included if they examined the use of a mobile health application in the setting of anesthesia or the perioperative (immediate preoperative,, intraoperative,, and postoperative) period. Studies were excluded if they explored video interventions or did not examine the feasibility or efficacy of the mobile app.
34533468#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We included 29 articles,, and three areas of clinical functionality were identified: patient-centered care (preoperative,, intraoperative,, and postoperative),, systems-based improvement,, and medical education. Several studies demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of mobile apps in these areas,, but many are only tested for efficacy in simulated environments or with small patient samples.

27101287#ABSTRACT##Innovative technologies for digital imaging and telecommunications are changing the way we deliver health care. Telepathology collaborations are one example of how delivering remote pathology services to patients can benefit from leveraging this change. Over the years,, several academic and commercial teleconsultation networks have been established. Herein,, we review the landscape of these international telepathology efforts and highlight key supportive factors and potential barriers to successful cross-border collaborations. Important features of successful international telepathology programs include efficient workflows,, dedicated information technology staff,, continuous maintenance,, financial incentives,, ensuring that all involved stakeholders are satisfied,, and value-added clinical benefit to patient care. Factors that plague such telepathology operations include legal/regulatory issues,, sustainability,, and cultural and environmental issues. Pathologists,, vendors and laboratory accreditation agencies will need to embrace and capitalize on this new paradigm of international telepathology accordingly.

35263798#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study design comprised a systematic iterative approach in which expert knowledge was contrasted with findings from literature. Forty-three eHealth usability evaluation methods were systematically identified and assessed regarding their ease of applicability and usefulness through semi-structured expert interviews with 10 European usability experts and systematic literature research. The most appropriate eHealth usability evaluation methods were selected stepwise based on the experts' judgements of their ease of applicability and usefulness.
35263798#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of these 43 eHealth usability evaluation methods identified as suitable for agile,, easily applicable,, and useful eHealth usability evaluations,, 10 were recommended by the experts based on their usefulness for rapid eHealth usability evaluations. The three most frequently recommended eHealth usability evaluation methods were Remote User Testing,, Expert Review,, and Rapid Iterative Test and Evaluation Method. Eleven usability evaluation methods,, such as Retrospective Testing,, were not recommended for use in rapid eHealth usability evaluations.
35263798#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#We conducted a systematic review and expert-validation to identify rapidly deployable eHealth usability evaluation methods. The comprehensive and evidence-based prioritization of eHealth usability evaluation methods supports faster usability evaluations,, and so contributes to the ease-of-use of emerging eHealth systems.

36466953#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The proliferation and increasing maturity of biometric monitoring technologies allow clinical investigators to measure the health status of trial participants in a more holistic manner,, especially outside of traditional clinical settings. This includes capturing meaningful aspects of health in daily living and a more granular and objective manner compared to traditional tools in clinical settings.
36466953#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#Within multidisciplinary teams,, statisticians and data scientists are increasingly involved in clinical trials that incorporate digital clinical measures. They are called upon to provide input into trial planning,, generation of evidence on the clinical validity of novel clinical measures,, and evaluation of the adequacy of existing evidence. Analysis objectives related to demonstrating clinical validity of novel clinical measures differ from typical objectives related to demonstrating safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions using established measures which statisticians are most familiar with.
36466953#ABSTRACT#KEY MESSAGES#This paper discusses key considerations for generating evidence for clinical validity through the lens of the type and intended use of a clinical measure. This paper also briefly discusses the regulatory pathways through which clinical validity evidence may be reviewed and highlights challenges that investigators may encounter while dealing with data from biometric monitoring technologies.

34086059#ABSTRACT##Atrial fibrillation (AF) will become one of the biggest challenges in cardiovascular medicine in the near future. Attempting an improvement in future patient care calls explicitly for the screening of subclinical AF. Digital health solutions implementing communication technologies for the collection and analysis of digitally assessable data will most likely serve this need. Several new rapidly developing methods were introduced in the past decade. Although the vast majority still require scientific validation,, the body of evidence is growing and several randomized controlled trials are planned. This review aims to give an overview of current technologies with a specific focus on mobile health (mHealth) and appraise their value with regard to the available scientific data.

34624434#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Our objectives were to assess: (1) the effectiveness of existing mHealth apps for reducing symptoms of maternal depression and/or anxiety during the prenatal period and/or the first year postpartum,, and (2) the app quality of commercially available apps targeting perinatal depression and/or anxiety.
34624434#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To address Objective 1,, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE,, CINAHL,, PsycINFO,, Web of Science,, and Embase) from their inception until May 3rd,, 2021. For the second objective,, we searched Google Play and Apple App Stores in the United States,, United Kingdom,, Canada,, and Australia until May 3rd,, 2021.
34624434#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our search identified 3,,897 articles,, seven of which were meta-analyzed. mHealth apps did not improve perinatal depression (SMD,, -0.39; 95% CI,, -0.80 to 0.03) or anxiety (SMD,, 0.01; 95% CI,, -0.13 to 0.16) within the first 3 months post-intervention or at 6 months post-intervention. Our search of app stores identified 74 commercially available apps,, 37 of which were evaluated via MARS tool. Current apps for perinatal anxiety and/or depression were rated to be of moderate quality on the MARS (mean,, 3.6/5).
34624434#ABSTRACT#LIMITATIONS#There is a small number of overall studies in this field and the individual studies have methodological limitations. Furthermore,, few apps identified in our app store search have been clinically tested.
34624434#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Despite their widespread availability,, mHealth apps do not appear to effectively reduce perinatal depression or anxiety,, and few were subjectively rated to be of high quality. There is a need to develop higher quality mHealth apps and assess their potential to improve perinatal maternal mental health.

35394446#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile devices have greatly facilitated the use of digital health resources,, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile health (mHealth) has become a common and important way to monitor and improve health conditions for people from different social classes. The ability to utilize mHealth affects its effectiveness; therefore,, the widespread application of mHealth technologies calls for an instrument that can accurately measure health literacy in the era of mobile media.
35394446#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to (1) identify the components of mHealth literacy for ordinary users and (2) develop a systematic scale for appropriately measuring individuals' self-perceived mHealth literacy through a problem-based framework.
35394446#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted an exploratory study involving in-depth interviews and observations (15 participants) in January 2020 and used exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to identify the components of mHealth literacy and develop an item pool. In February 2020,, we conducted a pilot survey with 148 participants to explore the factor structures of items identified during the exploratory study. Subsequently,, 2 surveys were administrated using quota sampling. The first survey (conducted in Guangdong,, China) collected 552 responses during March 2020; we assessed composite reliability,, convergent validity,, and discriminant validity. The second survey (conducted in China nationwide) collected 433 responses during October 2021; we assessed criterion-related validity using structural equation modeling.

The second survey revealed that mHealth use had a significant impact (ß=0.43,, P<.001) on mHealth literacy and that mHealth literacy had a significant impact (ß=0.23,, P<.001) on health prevention behavior.
35394446#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study revealed the distinctiveness of mHealth literacy by placing mHealth needs,, the ability to understand medical terms,, and the skills in patient-doctor interactions in the foreground. The Problem-Based mHealth Literacy Scale is a useful instrument for comprehensively measuring individuals' mHealth literacy and extends the concept of health literacy to the context of mobile communication.

36445731#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven serious games have been used in health care to offer a customizable and immersive experience. Summarizing the features of the current AI-driven serious games is very important to explore how they have been developed and used and their current state to plan on how to leverage them in the current and future health care needs.
36445731#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to explore the features of AI-driven serious games in health care as reported by previous research.
36445731#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a scoping review to achieve the abovementioned objective. The most popular databases in the information technology and health fields (ie,, MEDLINE,, PsycInfo,, Embase,, CINAHL,, IEEE Xplore,, ACM Digital Library,, and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to serious games and AI. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection process. Three reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies. A narrative approach was used for data synthesis.
36445731#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search process returned 1470 records. Of these 1470 records,, 46 (31.29%) met all eligibility criteria. A total of 64 different serious games were found in the included studies. Motor impairment was the most common health condition targeted by these serious games. Serious games were used for rehabilitation in most of the studies. The most common genres of serious games were role-playing games,, puzzle games,, and platform games. Unity was the most prominent game engine used to develop serious games. PCs were the most common platform used to play serious games. The most common algorithm used in the included studies was support vector machine. The most common purposes of AI were the detection of disease and the evaluation of user performance. The size of the data set ranged from 36 to 795,,600. The most common validation techniques used in the included studies were k-fold cross-validation and training-test split validation. Accuracy was the most commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of AI models.
36445731#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The last decade witnessed an increase in the development of AI-driven serious games for health care purposes,, targeting various health conditions,, and leveraging multiple AI algorithms; this rising trend is expected to continue for years to come. Although the evidence uncovered in this study shows promising applications of AI-driven serious games,, larger and more rigorous,, diverse,, and robust studies may be needed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of AI-driven serious games in different populations with different health conditions.

34235833#ABSTRACT##The prominent rise of digital health in ophthalmology is evident in the current age of Industry 4.0. Despite the many facets of digital health,, there has been a greater slant in interest and focus on artificial intelligence recently. Other major elements of digital health like wearables could also substantially impact patient-focused outcomes but have been relatively less explored and discussed. In this review,, we comprehensively evaluate the use of non-artificial intelligence digital health tools in ophthalmology. 53 papers were included in this systematic review - 25 papers discuss virtual or augmented reality,, 14 discuss mobile applications and 14 discuss wearables. Most papers focused on the use of technologies to detect or rehabilitate visual impairment,, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Overall,, the findings on patient-focused outcomes with the adoption of these technologies are encouraging. Further validation,, large-scale studies and earlier consideration of real-world barriers are warranted to enable better real-world implementation.

28423744#ABSTRACT##Emerging technologies show great potential in the field of patient care. One such technology is mobile heath applications (mhealth apps),, which have exploded in number and variety in recent years,, and offer great promise in the ability to collect and monitor patient health data. Despite their apparent success in proliferation and user adoption,, these applications struggle to integrate into the primary care system and there is scant information regarding their efficacy to effect patient behavior and consequently health outcomes. In this paper we investigate the potential of a promising clinical evaluation methodology,, response adaptive randomized clinical trials,, to rapidly and effectively evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of mhealth apps and to personalize mhealth app selection to individualize patient benefit. Diabetes prevention provides the use case for evaluating the case for and against response-adaptive randomized trials.

35483022#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The C-Score,, which is an individual health score,, is based on a predictive model validated in the UK and US populations. It was designed to serve as an individualized point-in-time health assessment tool that could be integrated into clinical counseling or consumer-facing digital health tools to encourage lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of premature death.
35483022#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our study aimed to conduct an external validation of the C-Score in the US population and expand the original score to improve its predictive capabilities in the US population. The C-Score is intended for mobile health apps on wearable devices.
35483022#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a literature review to identify relevant variables that were missing in the original C-Score. Subsequently,, we used data from the 2005 to 2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; N=21,,015) to test the capacity of the model to predict all-cause mortality. We used NHANES III data from 1988 to 1994 (N=1440) to conduct an external validation of the test. Only participants with complete data were included in this study. Discrimination and calibration tests were conducted to assess the operational characteristics of the adapted C-Score from receiver operating curves and a design-based goodness-of-fit test.
35483022#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Higher C-Scores were associated with reduced odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio 0.96,, P<.001). We found a good fit of the C-Score for all-cause mortality with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72. Among participants aged between 40 and 69 years,, C-Score models had a good fit for all-cause mortality and an AUC >0.72. A sensitivity analysis using NHANES III data (1988-1994) was performed,, yielding similar results. The inclusion of sociodemographic and clinical variables in the basic C-Score increased the AUCs from 0.72 (95% CI 0.71-0.73) to 0.87 (95% CI 0.85-0.88).
35483022#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our study shows that this digital biomarker,, the C-Score,, has good capabilities to predict all-cause mortality in the general US population. An expanded health score can predict 87% of the mortality in the US population. This model can be used as an instrument to assess individual mortality risk and as a counseling tool to motivate behavior changes and lifestyle modifications.

35486413#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#With increased reliance on digital health care,, including telehealth,, efficient and effective ways are needed to assess patients' comfort and confidence with using these services.
35486413#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We first developed an item pool using existing literature and expert review. We then administered the items to participants as part of a larger study. Participants were caregivers of children receiving care at a pediatric clinic who completed a survey either on the web or over the telephone. We randomized participants into development and confirmatory samples,, stratifying by language so that exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis could be performed with separate samples of participants. We assessed the scale's validity by examining its associations with participants' demographics,, digital access,, and prior digital health care use.
35486413#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Participants (N=508) were,, on average,, aged 34.7 (SD 7.7) years,, and 89.4% (454/508) were women. Of the 508 participants,, 280 (55.1%) preferred English as their primary language,, 157 (30.9%) preferred Spanish,, and 71 (14%) preferred Arabic; 228 (45%) had a high school degree or less; and 230 (45.3%) had an annual household income of <US $35,,000. Using exploratory factor analysis,, 3 items were retained in a reduced scale with excellent reliability (Cronbach a=.90) and a high variance explained (78%). The reduced scale had excellent fit,, with factor loadings between 0.82 and 0.94. All fit statistics exceeded the criteria for good fit between the proposed factor structure and the data. We refer to this scale as the Digital Health Care Literacy Scale. The scale was positively associated with education (?=0.139; P=.005) and income (?=0.379; P<.001). Arabic speakers had lower scores than English (P<.001) and Spanish speakers (P=.02),, and Spanish speakers had lower scores than English speakers (P<.001). Participants who did not own a smartphone (P=.13) or laptop computer (P<.001) had lower scores than those who owned these devices. Finally,, participants who had not used digital tools,, including health apps (P<.001) and video telehealth (P<.001),, had lower scores than those who had used these tools.
35486413#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the potential for digital health care to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes,, many individuals may not have the skills to engage with and benefit from it. Moreover,, these individuals may be those who already experience worse outcomes. A screening tool such as the Digital Health Care Literacy Scale could be a useful resource to identify patients who require additional assistance to use digital health services and help ensure health equity.

34117697#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Patient-centred e-health (PCEH) focusses on the interaction between patients and physicians. However,, only a limited number of studies have focussed on the design of physician-patient value cocreation mechanisms in the PCEH context. Thus,, we extend Grönroos' concept of value cocreation to understand how PCEH might improve the quality of care.
34117697#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#This study proposes a theoretical framework to embody PCEH-supported value cocreation and presents some empirical validation. We expect that PCEH-supported value cocreation should comprise capabilities for patient empowerment,, intention for information sharing,, complementation for checking and verifying information,, and interaction for shared understanding.
34117697#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study surveyed a small group of patients that have used PCEH,, 'My Health Bank' in Taiwan. The questionnaires were delivered to patients in hospitals (n = 167 questionnaires,, 98% response rate).
34117697#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Results indicate that certain PCEH-supported value cocreation mechanisms-capabilities for patient empowerment and interaction for shared understanding-affect the perceived quality of medical care.
34117697#ABSTRACT#LIMITATIONS#The survey only considered patient perceptions of value cocreation.
34117697#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study shows the patient perception of value cocreation in patient-centred e-Health. Further research needs to validate the framework for health professionals and in other e-Health record information sharing settings.

37477966#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#eHealth monitoring technologies offer opportunities to more objectively assess symptoms when they appear in daily life. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood with an episodic course,, requiring close follow-up of pediatric asthma control to identify disease deterioration,, prevent exacerbations,, and enhance quality of life. eHealth technologies in pediatric asthma care show promising results regarding feasibility,, acceptability,, and asthma-related health outcomes. However,, broad systematic evaluations of eHealth technologies in pediatric asthma are lacking.

30210714#ABSTRACT##Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) in Saudi Arabia are dedicated to providing high-quality patient care and promoting the health and wellbeing of its citizens. Additionally,, they provide medical education and conduct research in a wide range of clinical disciplines. A recent global trend in academic hospitals with mandates similar to those in Saudi Arabia is that they have started utilizing digital health technology in a bid to increase efficiency and improve the quality of patient care. This paper takes the position that such digital health technologies should also be utilized in AMC settings in Saudi Arabia. Electronic health records (EHRs),, smartphones,, video-imaging technologies,, virtual desktop infrastructures,, mobile EHR access,, and smart-beds can help AMCs serve patients more effectively. Rural people can be connected to consultants at AMCs using these technologies using virtual self-care tools. Validation of new digital health devices can be performed in collaboration with digital health partners and serve to enrich the knowledge of medical students in the area of digital health. This review aims to draw the attention of stakeholders to the need to implement digital health technology in AMCs in Saudi Arabia and help improve the quality of healthcare.
37477966#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this scoping review was to identify the types and applications of eHealth technologies for monitoring and treatment in pediatric asthma and explore which monitoring domains show the most relevance or potential for future research.
37477966#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A systematic and comprehensive search was performed on English papers that investigated the development,, validation,, or application of eHealth technologies for home monitoring or treatment of pediatric asthma in the following databases: PubMed,, Cochrane Library,, IEEE,, Scopus,, CINAHL,, PsycINFO,, and ACM Digital Library. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. Data were presented by a descriptive analysis of characteristics and a narrative report for each eHealth domain.
37477966#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This systematic scoping review provides a unique overview of eHealth pediatric asthma monitoring studies,, and it revealed that eHealth research takes place throughout different monitoring domains using different approaches. The outcomes of the review showed the potency for efficacy of most monitoring domains (especially the domains of medication monitoring,, lung function,, and digital environment). Future studies could focus on modifying potentially relevant hospital-based diagnostics for the home setting to investigate potential beneficial effects and focus on combining home-monitoring domains to facilitate multiparameter decision-making and personalized clinical decision support.

37477966#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The review included 370 manuscripts. The following 10 monitoring domains were identified: air quality,, airway inflammation markers,, lung function,, physical activity,, sleep,, audiovisual,, other physiological measurements,, questionnaires,, medication monitoring,, and digital environment (ie,, digital platforms,, applications,, websites,, and software tools to monitor or support monitoring). Rising numbers of studies were seen,, and the numbers accelerated in the last few years throughout most domains,, especially medication monitoring and digital environment. Limited studies (35/370,, 9.5%) of multiparameter monitoring strategies,, using three or more domains,, were found. The number of monitoring validation studies remained stable,, while development and intervention studies increased. Intervention outcomes seemed to indicate the noninferiority and potential superiority of eHealth monitoring in pediatric asthma.
34307394#ABSTRACT##Digital technologies and data science have laid down the promise to revolutionize healthcare by transforming the way health and disease are analyzed and managed in the future. Digital health applications in healthcare include telemedicine,, electronic health records,, wearable,, implantable,, injectable and ingestible digital medical devices,, health mobile apps as well as the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to medical and public health prognosis and decision-making. As is often the case with technological advancement,, progress in digital health raises compelling ethical,, legal,, and social implications (ELSI). This article aims to succinctly map relevant ELSI of the digital health field. The issues of patient autonomy; assessment,, value attribution,, and validation of health innovation; equity and trustworthiness in healthcare; professional roles and skills and data protection and security are highlighted against the backdrop of the risks of dehumanization of care,, the limitations of machine learning-based decision-making and,, ultimately,, the future contours of human interaction in medicine and public health. The running theme to this article is the underlying tension between the promises of digital health and its many challenges,, which is heightened by the contrasting pace of scientific progress and the timed responses provided by law and ethics. Digital applications can prove to be valuable allies for human skills in medicine and public health. Similarly,, ethics and the law can be interpreted and perceived as more than obstacles,, but also promoters of fairness,, inclusiveness,, creativity and innovation in health.

34856962#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Offshore industries operate all around the world in diverse and remote environments. The use of telemedicine to ensure up-to-date medical care for thousands of people offshore has been common practice for decades. Thus,, in this setting,, extensive experiences with this type of health care delivery have already been gathered,, while in other settings this is just beginning. However,, the quality of telemedical care on offshore installations is rarely reported yet. The objective of this review was to explore published literature with regards to the following questions: Have any Quality Indicators (QIs) been published for measuring the quality of telemedical care on offshore installations or are there identifiable items that could be used as such QIs?

34856962#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a comprehensive Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) of the published literature using the databases MEDLINE,, Cochrane Library,, Web of Science (Core Collection),, and Google Scholar. Search results were read and QIs or findings from which QIs could be derived were classified according to the dimensions of quality established by Donabedian (structure,, process,, or outcome QIs).
34856962#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search returned 10,,236 non-recurring articles,, 45 of which were full-text screened and 15 of which were included in this review. Types of publications were heterogenous. No QIs for the quality of telemedical care offshore have been published yet. Findings that could be the basis for QIs focused on structure quality (11 QIs) followed by process quality (11 QIs),, while outcome quality was less common (1 QI).
34856962#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Currently,, although years of experience with telemedical care on offshore installations exist,, there is a paucity of research on a solid data base regarding the quality of telemedical care offshore. The authors derived a list of 24 possible QIs from the findings of the publications for further validation. This could be the basis for implementation and definition of QIs in this and in similar remote settings.

30064497#ABSTRACT##The number and variety of eHealth services for adults and older adults who use hearing aids (HAs) are growing rapidly. This area holds promise to increase cost-efficiency,, enable better access to care,, and improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. Despite the increasing interest in this field,, an up-to-date picture of recent research in the area of eHealth for adults with HAs is lacking. In this state-of-the-art review we assessed the literature from the past decade about eHealth use in the HA adult patient journey. Systematic searches were conducted in CINAHL,, PubMed,, Scopus,, and Web of Science. A total of 34 peer-reviewed empirical records were identified from the searches and from the reference lists of searched records. Records were characterized based on: eHealth platform (i.e.: offline,, Internet-based,, or mobile-based),, service [i.e.: education and information,, screening and assessment,, hearing rehabilitation,, or general (tele-audiology)],, and phase of the patient journey (i.e.: pre-fitting,, fitting,, or post-fitting). The review highlighted a growing interest in the field,, as revealed by an increasing trend over the search period,, from 2 records in 2009-2010 up to 17 records in 2015-2016. Internet-based platforms were the most frequently used (present in more than half of the included records),, with a stable trend in the period. About one-third of the records introduced services over offline platforms,, whereas mobile-based platforms were used only in 6 out of 34 records,, suggesting that the clinical uptake of mobile services is still limited compared to more mature offline and Internet-based platforms. Most of the eHealth services observed were related to the areas of education and information (42.5%) and hearing rehabilitation (40.4%),, whereas 10.7% were related to screening and assessment,, and 6.4% to general tele-audiology services. Many services covered different phases of the patient journey,, especially the fitting and post-fitting phases. Overall,, this review showed that the field of eHealth in the context of HA rehabilitation in adults has grown in the recent past. Research is still needed to increase the uptake and efficacy of eHealth in clinical practice,, especially in terms of technology developments,, technical and clinical validation,, and optimization of strategies for service delivery.

34524089#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We performed a systematic review to characterize the nature of academic research on digital clinical measures and to compare and contrast the types of sensors used and the sources of funding support for specific subareas of this research.
34524089#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a PubMed search using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles reporting US-led academic research on digital clinical measures between January 2019 and February 2021. We screened each publication against specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified and categorized research studies based on the types of academic research,, sensors used,, and funding sources. Finally,, we compared and contrasted the funding support for these specific subareas of research and sensor types.
34524089#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search retrieved 4240 articles of interest. Following the screening,, 295 articles remained for data extraction and categorization. The top five research subareas included operations research (research analysis; n=225,, 76%),, analytical validation (n=173,, 59%),, usability and utility (data visualization; n=123,, 42%),, verification (n=93,, 32%),, and clinical validation (n=83,, 28%). The three most underrepresented areas of research into digital clinical measures were ethics (n=0,, 0%),, security (n=1,, 0.5%),, and data rights and governance (n=1,, 0.5%). Movement and activity trackers were the most commonly studied sensor type,, and physiological (mechanical) sensors were the least frequently studied. We found that government agencies are providing the most funding for research on digital clinical measures (n=192,, 65%),, followed by independent foundations (n=109,, 37%) and industries (n=56,, 19%),, with the remaining 12% (n=36) of these studies completely unfunded.
34524089#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Specific subareas of academic research related to digital clinical measures are not keeping pace with the rapid expansion and adoption of digital sensing products. An integrated and coordinated effort is required across academia,, academic partners,, and academic funders to establish the field of digital clinical measures as an evidence-based field worthy of our trust.

36174415#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study was conducted in three phases: (1) modification of MASUN 1.0 to improve its importance,, applicability,, relevance,, and clarity,, in consultation with 21 experts in medical or nursing informatics; (2) validation of the draft MASUN 2.0,, with 13 experts; and (3) feasibility testing of MASUN 2.0 and usability evaluation of the best app found through MASUN 2.0. Menstrual apps were used to test the framework.
36174415#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From Phases 1 and 2,, MASUN 2.0,, the framework for mHealth App selection,, was derived with improved simplicity,, usability,, and applicability through a reduced number of tasks and time required. In Phase 3,, after screening and scoring 2377 menstrual apps,, five candidate apps were selected and evaluated by five clinical experts,, five app experts,, and five potential users. Finally,, 194 users evaluated the usability of the app selected as the best. The best app helped users understand their health-related syndromes and patterns. Additionally,, user-provided scores for impact,, usefulness,, and ease of use for the app were higher than for others.
36174415#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study successfully modified MASUN 1.0 into MASUN 2.0 and verified MASUN 2.0 through content validity,, feasibility,, and usability testing. The selected apps through MASUN 2.0 helped health consumers more easily address health discomfort. Future research should extend this work to an automated system and different medical conditions with multiple stakeholders for digital health equity.

35409778#ABSTRACT##Digital health literacy influences decision-making in health. There are no validated instruments to evaluate the digital literacy about COVID-19 in Spanish-speaking countries. This study aimed to validate the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI) about COVID-19 adapted to Spanish (COVID-DHLI-Spanish) in university students and to describe its most important results. A cross-sectional study was developed with 2318 university students from Spain,, Puerto Rico,, and Ecuador. Internal consistency was measured with Cronbach’s alpha and principal component analysis. Construct validity was analyzed using Spearman’s correlations and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was good for the global scale (Cronbach’s alpha 0.69,, 95% CI 0.67) as well as for its dimensions. A total of 51.1% (n = 946) of students had sufficient digital literacy,, 40.1% (n = 742) had problematic digital literacy,, and 8.8% (n = 162) had inadequate digital literacy. The DHLI was directly and significantly correlated with age,, subjective social perception,, sense of coherence,, and well-being (p < 0.001). The average digital literacy was higher in men than in women,, in students older than 22 years,, and in those with greater satisfaction with online information (p < 0.001). The COVID-DHLI-Spanish is useful for measuring the digital literacy about COVID-19 in Spanish-speaking countries. This study suggests gaps by gender and socioeconomic perception.

33673952#ABSTRACT##Cardiology represents one of the privileged disciplinary areas for the experimentation and validation of the applications of telemedicine. Telemedicine,, and the health technologies that go by the name of eHealth,, identify the digital exchange of social and health information in order to support and optimize the care process remotely. Telemonitoring applied to cardiovascular diseases is defined as the recording,, remote transmission,, storage,, and interpretation of cardiovascular parameters and diagnostic images. Meta-analyses have shown that telemedicine-supported models of care not only are effective but also cost-effective.

28527027#ABSTRACT##Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the USA. However,, limited data exists regarding smoking cessation mobile app quality and intervention effectiveness. Innovative and scalable interventions are needed to further alleviate the public health implications of tobacco addiction. The proliferation of the smartphone and the advent of mobile phone health interventions have made treatment more accessible than ever. The purpose of this review was to examine the relation between published scientific literature and available commercial smartphone health apps for smoking cessation to identify the percentage of scientifically supported apps that were commercially available to consumers and to determine how many of the top commercially available apps for smoking cessation were supported by the published scientific literature. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines,, apps were reviewed in four phases: (1) identified apps from the scientific literature,, (2) searched app stores for apps identified in the literature,, (3) identified top apps available in leading app stores,, and (4) determined which top apps available in stores had scientific support. Seven articles identified six apps with some level of scientific support,, three (50%) were available in at least one app store. Conversely,, among the top 50 apps suggested by each of the leading app stores,, only two (4%) had any scientific support. While half of the scientifically vetted apps remain available to consumers,, they are difficult to find among the many apps that are identified through app store searches.

26540642#ABSTRACT##Telepsychiatry (TP; video; synchronous) is effective,, well received and a standard way to practice. Best practices in TP education,, but not its desired outcomes,, have been published. This paper proposes competencies for trainees and clinicians,, with TP situated within the broader landscape of e-mental health (e-MH) care. TP competencies are organized using the US Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education framework,, with input from the CanMEDS framework. Teaching and assessment methods are aligned with target competencies,, learning contexts,, and evaluation options. Case examples help to apply concepts to clinical and institutional contexts. Competencies can be identified,, measured and evaluated. Novice or advanced beginner,, competent/proficient,, and expert levels were outlined. Andragogical (i.e. pedagogical) methods are used in clinical care,, seminar,, and other educational contexts. Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation using quantitative and qualitative measures promotes skills development via iterative feedback from patients,, trainees,, and faculty staff. TP and e-MH care significantly overlap,, such that institutional leaders may use a common approach for change management and an e-platform to prioritize resources. TP training and assessment methods need to be implemented and evaluated. Institutional approaches to patient care,, education,, faculty development,, and funding also need to be studied.

34076111#ABSTRACT##Self-care is encouraged in the type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) setting. Thus,, this research aimed to develop and validate a mobile application (APP) to promote self-care for adolescents with DM1. The method was divided into two stages: development and validation,, ranging from literature review,, benchmarking,, prototype construction to validation by specialists. The APP construction was subsidized by the seven steps proposed by the American Association of Diabetes Educators. The screens were designed and possible functions were selected. After the design,, the APP prototype was developed and named "DM Agendinha". The content validation process was mediated by the Suitability Assessment of Materials tool,, where the percentage obtained was 85.3%,, characterizing the APP as "Superior Material". The Smartphone Usability questionnaire was employed for technical validation,, and the APP reached a global Content Validity Index of 0.96. We concluded,, therefore,, that the use of this material by adolescents will favor the acquisition of new knowledge and adherence to healthy practices,, considering that it is a highly intelligible electronic technology.
32103746#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Physicians' PQoC was found to be positively affected by the level of mHealth utilization and TTF,, while the magnitude of the TTF direct effect was two times stronger than utilization. Additionally,, self-efficacy has the highest direct and total effect on mHealth utilization; in the formation of TTF,, technological characteristics dominate followed by task characteristics.
32103746#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#To date,, the impact of utilized mHealth on PQoC has neither been richly theorized nor explored in depth. We address this gap in existing literature. Realizing how an organization can improve TTF will lead to better PQoC.

36656624#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search for apps was conducted in Google Play Store using the following search string: ["best weight loss app for obese teens 2020"] OR ["obesity applications for teens"] OR ["popular weight loss applications"]. The most popular apps available in both Google Play and Apple App Store that fulfilled the requirements within the inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis. The designs of 17 mHealth apps were analyzed for the inclusion of BCTs supported by various UIDPs. Based on the results of the analysis,, BCT-UI design guidelines were developed. The usability of the guidelines was presented using a prototype app.
36656624#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The app analysis results showed that the implementation of BCTs using UIDPs is underutilized. The purposed guidelines will help developers in designing mHealth apps for young people that are easy to use and support behavior change.

18431862#ABSTRACT##Telerehabilitation in which rehabilitation services are provided at a distance using communication technologies is a new and developing field of telehealth. Primarily developed to provide equitable access to individuals who are geographically remote and to those who are physically and economically disadvantaged,, telerehabilitation also has the capacity to improve the quality of rehabilitation health care. Online delivery of rehabilitation enables the rehabilitation therapist to optimize the timing,, intensity and duration of therapy that is often not possible within the constraints of face-to-face treatment protocols in current health systems. This chapter outlines the advances made to date in telerehabilitation applications in the fields of physiotherapy,, speech-language pathology,, occupational therapy,, and biomedical engineering and provides evidence for the success of these applications. Applications to date encompass systems ranging from low-bandwidth low-cost videophones,, to highly expensive,, fully immersive virtual reality systems with haptic interfaces. A number of barriers to the establishment and advancement of telerehabilitation within health care systems have been outlined and include professional issues relating to the inherent hands-on approach of some treatments,, licensure laws,, professional skill development,, patient disability,, reimbursement,, and the paucity of online assessment and treatment tools and outcomes data. In response,, possible solutions to these barriers such as the development and validation of alternative assessment and treatment procedures,, involvement in the international policy debate,, as well as the resolution of national professional policies which hinder the wider uptake of telerehabilitation technologies,, have been outlined. The future of telerehabilitation is promising as a new,, yet complex form of telehealth with the capacity to provide a wide range of services specifically designed to suit the needs of the individual.

34636737#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In recent years,, there has been rapid growth in the availability and use of mobile health (mHealth) apps around the world. A consensus regarding an accepted standard to assess the quality of such apps has yet to be reached. A factor that exacerbates the challenge of mHealth app quality assessment is variations in the interpretation of quality and its subdimensions. Consequently,, it has become increasingly difficult for health care professionals worldwide to distinguish apps of high quality from those of lower quality. This exposes both patients and health care professionals to unnecessary risks. Despite progress,, limited understanding of the contributions of researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) exists on this topic. Furthermore,, the applicability of quality assessment methodologies in LMIC settings remains relatively unexplored.
34636737#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This review was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). A search of PubMed,, EMBASE,, Web of Science,, and Scopus was performed for papers related to mHealth app quality assessment methodologies,, which were published in English between 2005 and 2020. By taking a rapid review approach,, a thematic and descriptive analysis of the papers was performed.
34636737#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Electronic database searches identified 841 papers. After the screening process,, 52 papers remained for inclusion. Of the 52 papers,, 5 (10%) proposed novel methodologies that could be used to evaluate mHealth apps of diverse medical areas of interest,, 8 (15%) proposed methodologies that could be used to assess apps concerned with a specific medical focus,, and 39 (75%) used methodologies developed by other published authors to evaluate the quality of various groups of mHealth apps. The authors in 6% (3/52) of papers were solely affiliated to institutes in LMICs. A further 15% (8/52) of papers had at least one coauthor affiliated to an institute in an LMIC.
34636737#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Quality assessment of mHealth apps is complex in nature and at times subjective. Despite growing research on this topic,, to date,, an all-encompassing appropriate means for evaluating the quality of mHealth apps does not exist. There has been engagement with authors affiliated to institutes across LMICs; however,, limited consideration of current generic methodologies for application in LMIC settings has been identified.

34091739#ABSTRACT##Standards and validation practices regarding mobile health apps need to be established to ensure their proper use and integration into medical practice. This paper proposes an innovative and integrative approach to examine and compare the quality of a certified health mobile applications set. A double classification framework (verified and perceived quality) is proposed and validated to evaluate the quality of 22 verified health mobile apps,, particularly to understand whether these apps provide the service demanded by its users. Evaluation of verified quality was based on a certification public program. To analysis user satisfaction,, we used content analysis to examine and extract words and expressions contained in online reviews (1,,574 reviews were analyzed). The R language was used to scrape data and to perform all statistical analyses. The results did not confirm a significant relationship between both classifications (p?>?.05). However,, the requirements with the highest degree of compliance ("design and relevance" and "quality and safety") of the app accreditation program were the best rated by the users of the apps in their comments. Reflections derived from this paper represent an important contribution to the knowledge base in the expanding research area of mobile health.

36656624#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Overweight and obesity have been linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. With more than a quarter of the young population having weight problems,, the impacts of overweight and obesity on this age group are particularly critical. Mobile health (mHealth) apps that support and encourage positive health behaviors have the potential to achieve better health outcomes. These apps represent a unique opportunity for young people (age range 10-24 years),, for whom mobile phones are an indispensable part of their everyday living. However,, despite the potential of mHealth apps for improved engagement in health interventions,, user adherence to these health interventions in the long term is low.
36656624#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aims of this research were to (1) review and analyze mHealth apps targeting obesity and overweight and (2) propose guidelines for the inclusion of user interface design patterns (UIDPs) in the development of mHealth apps for obese young people that maximizes the impact and retention of behavior change techniques (BCTs).

36656624#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results of our analysis showed that only half of the BCTs are implemented in the reviewed apps,, with a subset of those BCTs being supported by UIDPs. Based on these findings,, we propose design guidelines that associate the BCTs with UIDPs. The focus of our guidelines is the implementation of BCTs using design patterns that are impactful for the young people demographics. The UIDPs are classified into 6 categories,, with each BCT having one or more design patterns appropriate for its implementation. The applicability of the proposed guidelines is presented by mock-ups of the mHealth app "Morphe,," intended for young people (age range 10-24 years). The presented use cases showcase the 5 main functionalities of Morphe: learn,, challenge,, statistics,, social interaction,, and settings.

35256661#ABSTRACT##This study evaluates diabetes self-management mobile health applications available from European app stores with respect to quality,, concordance with recommended self-management tasks and implementation of persuasive system design principles. The European Play Store and Apple App Store were systematically searched and relevant apps were tested. Two raters independently assessed app quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale and conducted a content analysis of provided persuasive system design principles and self-management tasks. A total of 2,,269 mobile health applications were identified and 120 could be included in the evaluation. The overall quality was rated as moderate M?=?3.20 (SD?=?0.39,, min?=?2.31,, max?=?4.62),, with shortcomings in the subcategories of engagement (M?=?2.80,, SD?=?0.67) and information quality (M?=?2.26,, SD?=?0.48). Scientific evidence is available for 8% of the apps. The reviewed apps implemented a median of three persuasive system design principles (range 0-15) and targeted a median of 4.5 (range 1-8) self-management tasks,, however,, with a lack of information about psychosocial coping strategies. Most available diabetes self-management apps lack a scientific evidence base. Persuasive system design features are underrepresented and may form a promising tool to improve app quality. Furthermore,, the interaction of physical and behavioral health should be improved in existing diabetes self-management mobile health applications.

30226203#ABSTRACT##The classical role of the clinical laboratory,, seen as the central place where the samples converge and from where the results are distributed,, will be challenged by the development of digital health,, the application of information technology (big data) and genomics to health care. When the development of disruptive new technologies will allow the production of accurate results outside the laboratory,, its role will dramatically change. However,, several factors are slowing down these evolutions. The quality of the existing data is relatively poor: lack of standardization of results,, different units,, different reference intervals,, etc. The lab-on-a-chip technology is still relatively far from broad range application and the costs are higher than the traditional methods. There is the need for regulations of direct to consumer approaches that are posing big ethical problems. In the future,, the clinical laboratory will maintain part of the "classical" role in the areas of research education and services. The large production will continue,, favored by consolidation and reduction of the number of laboratories. The specialists of laboratory medicine have the task of collaborating with the national scientific societies and with the industry for improving harmonization of all the production phases,, thus allowing the production of meaningful big data. Clinical laboratories have the role of implementing translational medicine. The new point-of-care (POC) technologies still need validation,, the clinical laboratory is the place to do it. The advisory role toward clinicians and patients has to be improved,, and a role in validating laboratory data interpretation apps and in controlling and supervising the functionality and the quality of the POC devices has to be developed.

35171100#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Children increasingly use mobile apps. Strategies to increase child engagement with apps include the use of gamification and images that incite fun and interaction,, such as food. However,, the foods and beverages that children are exposed to while using apps are unknown and may vary by app type.
35171100#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to identify the app content (ie,, types of foods and beverages) included in nutrition-themed apps intended for children,, to assess the use of game-like features,, and to examine app characteristics such as overall quality and behavior change techniques (BCTs).

35171100#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This analysis used a cross-sectional database of nutrition-themed apps intended for children (=12 years),, collected between May 2018 and June 2019 from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (n=259). Apps were classified into four types: food games or nongames that included didactic nutrition guides,, habit trackers,, and other. Food and beverages were identified in apps and classified into 16 food categories,, as recommended (8/16,, 50%) and as not recommended (8/16,, 50%) by dietary guidelines,, and quantified by app type. Binomial logistic regression assessed whether game apps were associated with foods and beverages not recommended by guidelines. App quality,, overall and by subscales,, was determined using the Mobile App Rating Scale. The BCT Taxonomy was used to classify the different behavioral techniques that were identified in a subsample of apps (124/259,, 47.9%).
35171100#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 259 apps displayed a median of 6 (IQR 3) foods and beverages. Moreover,, 62.5% (162/259) of apps were classified as food games,, 27.4% (71/259) as didactic nutrition guides,, 6.6% (17/259) as habit trackers,, and 3.5% (9/259) as other. Most apps (198/259,, 76.4%) displayed at least one food or beverage that was not recommended by the dietary guidelines. Food game apps were almost 3 times more likely to display food and beverages not recommended by the guidelines compared with nongame apps (ß=2.8; P<.001). The overall app quality was moderate,, with a median Mobile App Rating Scale score of 3.6 (IQR 0.7). Functionality was the subscale with the highest score (median 4,, IQR 0.3). Nutrition guides were more likely to be educational and contain informative content on healthy eating (score 3.7),, compared with the other app types,, although they also scored significantly lower in engagement (score 2.3). Most apps (105/124,, 84.7%) displayed at least one BCT,, with the most common BCT being information about health consequences.
35171100#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings suggest nutrition-themed apps intended for children displayed food and beverage content not recommended by dietary guidelines,, with gaming apps more likely to display not recommended foods than their nongame counterparts. Many apps have a moderate app quality,, and the use of consequences (instead of rewards) was the most common BCT.

35119370#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) platforms show promise in the management of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. This has resulted in an abundance of mHealth platforms available for research or commercial use.
35119370#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this review is to characterize the current state of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression that are available for research,, commercial use,, or both.
35119370#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic review was conducted using a two-pronged approach: searching relevant literature with prespecified search terms to identify platforms in published research and simultaneously searching 2 major app stores-Google Play Store and Apple App Store-to identify commercially available platforms. Key characteristics of the mHealth platforms were synthesized,, such as platform name,, targeted condition,, targeted group,, purpose,, technology type,, intervention type,, commercial availability,, and regulatory information.
35119370#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The literature and app store searches yielded 169 and 179 mHealth platforms,, respectively. Most platforms developed for research purposes were designed for depression (116/169,, 68.6%),, whereas the app store search reported a higher number of platforms developed for anxiety (Android: 58/179,, 32.4%; iOS: 27/179,, 15.1%). The most common purpose of platforms in both searches was treatment (literature search: 122/169,, 72.2%; app store search: 129/179,, 72.1%). With regard to the types of intervention,, cognitive behavioral therapy and referral to care or counseling emerged as the most popular options offered by the platforms identified in the literature and app store searches,, respectively. Most platforms from both searches did not have a specific target age group. In addition,, most platforms found in app stores lacked clinical and real-world evidence,, and a small number of platforms found in the published research were available commercially.
35119370#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A considerable number of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression are available for research,, commercial use,, or both. The characteristics of these mHealth platforms greatly vary. Future efforts should focus on assessing the quality-utility,, safety,, and effectiveness-of the existing platforms and providing developers,, from both commercial and research sectors,, a reporting guideline for their platform description and a regulatory framework to facilitate the development,, validation,, and deployment of effective mHealth platforms.

26928960#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND AIMS#Electronic-health technologies (eHealth) such as Web-based interventions,, virtual clinics,, smart-phone applications,, and telemedicine are being used to manage patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to: (1) Evaluate the impact of eHealth technologies on conventional clinical indices and patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) in IBD; (2) assess the effectiveness,, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using eHealth technologies to facilitate the self-management of individuals with IBD,, and; (3) provide recommendations for their design and optimal use for patient care.
26928960#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Six randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies utilizing eHealth technologies in IBD were identified. Compared with standard outpatient-led care,, eHealth technologies have led to improvements in: Relapse duration [(n = 1) 18 days vs 77 days,, p < 0.001]; disease activity (n = 2); short-term medication adherence (n = 3); quality of life (n = 4); IBD knowledge (n = 2); healthcare costs (n = 4); the number of acute visits to the outpatient clinic due to IBD symptoms (n = 1),, and; facilitating the remote management of up to 20% of an IBD cohort (n = 2). Methodological shortcomings of eHealth studies include heterogeneity of outcome measures,, lack of clinician/patient input,, lack of validation against conventional clinical indices and PROs,, and limited cost-benefit analyses.
26928960#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#EHealth technologies have the potential for promoting self-management and reducing the impact of the growing burden of IBD on health care resource utilization. A theoretical framework should be applied to the development,, implementation,, and evaluation of eHealth interventions.

35639444#ABSTRACT##Introduction: Despite a good evidence base for telepsychiatry (TP),, economic cost analyses are infrequent and vary in quality. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the research question,, "From the perspective of an economic cost analysis for telehealth and telepsychiatry,, what are the most meaningful ways to ensure a study/intervention improved clinical care,, provided value to participants,, had population level impact,, and is sustainable?" The search in seven databases focused on keywords in four concept areas: (1) economic cost analysis,, (2) evaluation,, (3) telehealth and telepsychiatry,, and (4) quantifiable health status outcomes. The authors reviewed the full-text articles based on the inclusion (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH] of the keywords) and exclusion criteria. Results: Of a total of 2,,585 potential references,, a total of 99 articles met the inclusion criteria. The evaluation of telehealth and TP has focused on access,, quality,, patient outcomes,, feasibility,, effectiveness,, outcomes,, and cost. Cost-effectiveness,, cost-benefit,, and other analytic models are more common with telehealth than TP studies,, and these studies show favorable clinical,, quality of life,, and economic impact. A standard framework for economic cost analysis should include: an economist for planning,, implementation,, and evaluation; a tool kit or guideline; comprehensive analysis (e.g.,, cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; measures for health,, quality of life,, and utility outcomes for populations; methods to convert outcomes into economic benefits (e.g.,, monetary,, quality of adjusted life year); broad perspective (e.g.,, societal perspective); sensitivity analysis for uncertainty in modeling; and adjustments for differential timing (e.g.,, discounting and future costs). Conclusions: Technology assessment and economic cost analysis-such as effectiveness and implementation science approaches-contribute to clinical,, training,, research,, and other organizational missions. More research is needed with a framework that enables comparisons across studies and meta-analyses.

30635262#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 120 apps were examined. Although none of these apps had Food and Drug Administration marketing approval,, nearly 50% made claims that appeared medical. Most apps offered a similar type of services with 87.5% assigned WHO classification 1.4.2 'self-monitoring of health or diagnostic data by a client' or 1.6.1 'client look-up of health information'. The 'last updated' attribute was highly correlated with a quality rating of the app although no apps features (eg,, uses Global Positioning System,, reminders and so on) were.
30635262#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Due to the heterogeneity of the apps,, we were unable to define a core set of features that would accurately assess app quality. The number of apps making unsupported claims combined with the number of apps offering questionable content warrants a cautious approach by both patients and clinicians in selecting safe and effective ones.

35597101#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Persuasive design principles are increasingly employed in mHealth apps for motivating users and promoting healthy behaviours among individuals. However,, how the persuasive design principles are perceived by the mHealth app users remains unclear.
35597101#ABSTRACT#AIM#To develop and validate the content validity of an instrument designed to measure the user's perceptions of the persuasive design principles assimilated in a breastfeeding mHealth app.
35597101#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A critical review of the literature guided the development of the research instrument. The developed instrument was refined and validated through a two-round modified Delphi process. Ten experts drawn from academic and clinical settings evaluated the items through two content validity indicators,, relevance,, and clarity and provided narrative feedback. The content validity of the instrument was determined by calculating the Content Validity Index (CVI). Content validity indicators at the scale-level (S-CVI) and item-level (I-CVI) were calculated.
35597101#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results demonstrated high content validity index of individual items in the instrument. All items in the instrument reached an excellent I-CVI = 0.78 for both relevance and clarity except one item. The overall content validity index of the instrument using the average approach was moderate to high (S-CVI/Ave was 0.89 and 0.92 for relevance and clarity,, respectively). The developed research instrument is composed of 5 constructs representing 24 items: (1) primary task support,, (2) dialogue support,, (3) system credibility support,, (4) social support and (5) perceived persuasiveness.
35597101#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using a modified Delphi approach,, the development and validation of the research instrument demonstrated moderate to high content validity for measuring users' perceptions of the persuasive design principles assimilated in a breastfeeding mHealth app. The evidence from this study supports that the research instrument is valid,, relevant,, and clear.

10428449#ABSTRACT##Uses of telemedicine are described and potential roles for pharmacists are discussed. Telemedicine has been defined as "the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants." Technologies included in telemedicine are videoconferencing,, telephones,, computers,, the Internet,, fax,, radio,, and television. Telepharmacy has the same basic definition but refers to pharmaceutical care provision. Although the videotelemedicine market is expected to grow considerably,, lack of reimbursement and high costs are continuing obstacles. Pharmacy is using video-conferencing for education,, training,, and management purposes. The telephone has changed from a dial-and-talk instrument to a multimedia access tool. Medical devices are being attached to telephone lines to provide remote monitoring and therapy,, and call centers are providing medication counseling,, prior authorization,, refill authorization,, and formulary compliance monitoring. Although the Internet has quickly become a star performer,, utilization by health care lags behind that of other industries. The Internet-fueled empowerment of consumers and their expectations for speed,, access,, and convenience are creating more unmet expectations of the traditional health care system. Pharmacy has both organizational and individual practitioner Web sites,, but it is online drugstores that are attracting most attention. Potential benefits of telemedicine include improved access to care,, greater efficiency in diagnosis and treatment,, higher productivity,, and market positioning for the coming century. Telemedicine will tax the economic,, regulatory,, legal,, ethical,, and clinical care expertise of the entire health care system. Studies of the effectiveness,, cost,, and societal implications of telemedicine are needed,, along with practice models and standards,, training programs,, and solutions to regulatory,, licensing,, and legal questions. Securing reimbursement for cognitive services remains a problem for telemedicine and telepharmacy. Telemedicine presents profound opportunities and challenges to pharmacy and other health care professions.

35147711#ABSTRACT##Mobile health (mHealth) for the detection of atrial fibrillation is an innovative domestic monitoring of the heart rhythm. The use of mHealth in the context of atrial fibrillation increases the availability of diagnostic technologies and facilitates the integration into telemedical treatment concepts as well as the active participation of patients in the treatment process. The detection of atrial fibrillation with mHealth applications is usually based on electrocardiography (ECG) or by detection of the pulse wave using photoplethysmography (PPG). Some applications require additional sensors,, others make use of sensors integrated into smartphones or smartwatches. A high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of atrial fibrillation has been shown for most mHealth applications regardless of the underlying technology (analytical validation); however,, the evidence on positive care effects and improvement of medical endpoints (clinical validation) is so far scarce. Screening of symptomatic or asymptomatic patients and the follow-up care after antiarrhythmic measures are possibilities for the integration into the reality of care. The preventive detection of atrial fibrillation is an attractive field of application for mHealth with great potential for the future. Nevertheless,, at present mHealth is only integrated to a limited extent into the reality of patient care. Adequate reimbursement and medical remuneration as well as opportunities to derive information and qualification are prerequisites in order to be able to guarantee a comprehensive implementation in the future. The Digital Health Care Act passed in 2019,, regulates the reimbursement of digital healthcare applications but issues of primary preventive applications have not yet been included.

32338616#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to test the usability of 3 smartphone app-based self-tests of physical function using an iterative design.
32338616#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Objective measures of physical function in older adults are widely used to predict health outcomes such as disability,, institutionalization,, and mortality. App-based clinical tests allow users to assess their own physical function and have objective tracking of changes over time by use of their smartphones. Such tests can potentially guide interventions remotely and provide more detailed prognostic information about the participant's physical performance for the users,, therapists,, and other health care personnel. We developed 3 smartphone apps with instrumented versions of the Timed Up and Go (Self-TUG),, tandem stance (Self-Tandem),, and Five Times Sit-to-Stand (Self-STS) tests.
32338616#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The apps were tested in 3 iterations: the first (n=189) and second (n=134) in a lab setting and the third (n=20) in a separate home-based study. Participants were healthy adults between 60 and 80 years of age. Assessors observed while participants self-administered the tests without any guidance. Errors were recorded,, and usability problems were defined. Problems were addressed in each subsequent iteration. Perceived usability in the home-based setting was assessed by use of the System Usability Scale,, the User Experience Questionnaire,, and semi-structured interviews.
32338616#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the first iteration,, 7 usability problems were identified; 42 (42/189,, 22.0%) and 127 (127/189,, 67.2%) participants were able to correctly perform the Self-TUG and Self-Tandem,, respectively. In the second iteration,, errors caused by the problems identified in the first iteration were drastically reduced,, and 108 (108/134,, 83.1%) and 106 (106/134,, 79.1%) of the participants correctly performed the Self-TUG and Self-Tandem,, respectively. The first version of the Self-STS was also tested in this iteration,, and 40 (40/134,, 30.1%) of the participants performed it correctly. For the third usability test,, the 7 usability problems initially identified were further improved. Testing the apps in a home setting gave rise to some new usability problems,, and for Self-TUG and Self-STS,, the rates of correctly performed trials were slightly reduced from the second version,, while for Self-Tandem,, the rate increased. The mean System Usability Scale score was 77.63 points (SD 16.1 points),, and 80-95% of the participants reported the highest or second highest positive rating on all items in the User Experience Questionnaire.
32338616#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The study results suggest that the apps have the potential to be used to self-test physical function in seniors in a nonsupervised home-based setting. The participants reported a high degree of ease of use. Evaluating the usability in a home setting allowed us to identify new usability problems that could affect the validity of the tests. These usability problems are not easily found in the lab setting,, indicating that,, if possible,, app usability should be evaluated in both settings. Before being made available to end users,, the apps require further improvements and validation.

33682727#ABSTRACT##Remote and objective assessment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is an area of great interest particularly since the COVID-19 crisis emerged. In this paper,, we focus on a) the challenges of assessing motor severity via videos and b) the use of emerging video-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning techniques to quantitate human movement and its potential utility in assessing motor severity in patients with Parkinson's disease. While we conclude that video-based assessment may be an accessible and useful way of monitoring motor severity of Parkinson's disease,, the potential of video-based AI to diagnose and quantify disease severity in the clinical context is dependent on research with large,, diverse samples,, and further validation using carefully considered performance standards.

36821352#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of mobile health apps is rapidly increasing. This means that consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices,, and finding the benefit of such apps may be challenging. The significant international burden of breast cancer (BC) and the potential of mobile health apps to improve medical and public health practices mean that such apps will likely be important because of their functionalities in daily life. As the app market has grown exponentially,, several review studies have scrutinized cancer- or BC-related apps. However,, those reviews concentrated on the availability of the apps and relied on user ratings to decide on app quality. To minimize subjectivity in quality assessment,, quantitative methods to assess BC-related apps are required.
36821352#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study is to analyze the content and quality of BC-related apps to provide useful information for end users and clinicians.
36821352#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Based on a stepwise systematic approach,, we analyzed apps related to BC,, including those related to prevention,, detection,, treatment,, and survivor support. We used the keywords "breast cancer" in English and Korean to identify commercially available apps in the Google Play and App Store. The apps were then independently evaluated by 2 investigators to determine their eligibility for inclusion. The content and quality of the apps were analyzed using objective frameworks and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),, respectively.
36821352#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The quality of BC-related apps was generally acceptable according to the MARS,, but the gaps between the highest- and lowest-rated apps were large. In addition,, apps using personalized data were of higher quality than those merely giving related information,, especially after treatment in the cancer care continuum. We also found that apps that had been updated within 1 year and developed by private companies had higher MARS scores. This may imply that there are criteria for end users and clinicians to help choose the right apps for better clinical outcomes.

36821352#KEYWORD##breast cancer
36821352#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The initial search identified 1148 apps,, 69 (6%) of which were included. Most BC-related apps provided information,, and some recorded patient-generated health data,, provided psychological support,, and assisted with medication management. The Kendall coefficient of concordance between the raters was 0.91 (P<.001). The mean MARS score (range: 1-5) of the apps was 3.31 (SD 0.67; range: 1.94-4.53). Among the 5 individual dimensions,, functionality had the highest mean score (4.37,, SD 0.42) followed by aesthetics (3.74,, SD 1.14). Apps that only provided information on BC prevention or management of its risk factors had lower MARS scores than those that recorded medical data or patient-generated health data. Apps that were developed >2 years ago,, or by individuals,, had significantly lower MARS scores compared to other apps (P<.001).

29604050#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Common data elements (CDEs) are currently unavailable for mobile health (mHealth) in epilepsy devices and related applications. As a result,, despite expansive growth of new digital services for people with epilepsy,, information collected is often not interoperable or directly comparable. We aim to correct this problem through development of industry-wide standards for mHealth epilepsy data.
29604050#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using a group of stakeholders from industry,, academia,, and patient advocacy organizations,, we offer a consensus statement for the elements that may facilitate communication among different systems.
29604050#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A consensus statement is presented for epilepsy mHealth CDEs.
29604050#ABSTRACT#SIGNIFICANCE#Although it is not exclusive,, we believe that the use of a minimal common information denominator,, specifically these CDEs,, will promote innovation,, accelerate scientific discovery,, and enhance clinical usage across applications and devices in the epilepsy mHealth space. As a consequence,, people with epilepsy will have greater flexibility and ultimately more powerful tools to improve their lives.

27630020#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Numerous types of digital health interventions (DHIs) are available to patients and the public but many factors affect their ability to engage and enrol in them. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesise the qualitative literature on barriers and facilitators to engagement and recruitment to DHIs to inform future implementation efforts.
27630020#ABSTRACT#METHODS#PubMed,, MEDLINE,, CINAHL,, Embase,, Scopus and the ACM Digital Library were searched for English language qualitative studies from 2000 - 2015 that discussed factors affecting engagement and enrolment in a range of DHIs (e.g. 'telemedicine',, 'mobile applications',, 'personal health record',, 'social networking'). Text mining and additional search strategies were used to identify 1,,448 records. Two reviewers independently carried out paper screening,, quality assessment,, data extraction and analysis. Data was analysed using framework synthesis,, informed by Normalization Process Theory,, and Burden of Treatment Theory helped conceptualise the interpretation of results.

27630020#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Nineteen publications were included in the review. Four overarching themes that affect patient and public engagement and enrolment in DHIs emerged; 1) personal agency and motivation; 2) personal life and values; 3) the engagement and recruitment approach; and 4) the quality of the DHI. The review also summarises engagement and recruitment strategies used. A preliminary DIgital Health EnGagement MOdel (DIEGO) was developed to highlight the key processes involved. Existing knowledge gaps are identified and a number of recommendations made for future research. Study limitations include English language publications and exclusion of grey literature.
27630020#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This review summarises and highlights the complexity of digital health engagement and recruitment processes and outlines issues that need to be addressed before patients and the public commit to digital health and it can be implemented effectively. More work is needed to create successful engagement strategies and better quality digital solutions that are personalised where possible and to gain clinical accreditation and endorsement when appropriate. More investment is also needed to improve computer literacy and ensure technologies are accessible and affordable for those who wish to sign up to them.

33620473#ABSTRACT##Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 1.4 million people in the UK,, resulting in a five-fold increased stroke risk and a three to four times greater risk of severe,, disabling stroke. Atrial fibrillation,, a chronic disease,, requires monitoring,, medication,, and lifestyle measures. A self-management approach supported by mobile health (mHealth) may empower AF self-care. To assess the need to develop new mHealth self-management interventions for those with AF this review aimed to identify commercially available AF self-management apps,, analyse,, and synthesize (i) characteristics,, (ii) functions,, (iii) privacy/security,, (iv) incorporated behaviour change techniques (BCTs),, and (v) quality and usability. We searched app stores for 'atrial fibrillation' and 'anticoagulation',, and included apps focused on AF self-management in the review. We examined app functions,, privacy statements against best practice recommendations,, the inclusion of BCTs using the App Behaviour Change Scale,, and app quality/usability using the Mobile App Rating Scale. From an initial search of 555 apps,, five apps were included in the review. Common functions were educational content,, medication trackers,, and communication with healthcare professionals. Apps contained limited BCTs,, lacked intuitive functions and were difficult to use. Privacy policies were difficult to read. App quality rated from poor to acceptable and no app had been evaluated in a clinical trial. The review reports a lack of commercially available AF self-management apps of sufficient standard for use in healthcare settings. This highlights the need for clinically validated mHealth interventions incorporating evidence-based BCTs to support AF self-management.

36897627#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of the development of the Digital Health Readiness Questionnaire (DHRQ) was to create a short,, usable,, and freely accessible questionnaire that was designed from a clinical practice perspective.
36897627#ABSTRACT#METHODS#It was a prospective single-center survey study conducted in Jessa Hospital Hasselt in Belgium. The questionnaire was developed with a panel of field experts with questions in following 5 categories: digital usage,, digital skills,, digital literacy,, digital health literacy,, and digital learnability. All participants who were visiting the cardiology department as patients between February 1,, 2022,, and June 1,, 2022,, were eligible for participation. Cronbach a and confirmatory factor analysis were performed.
36897627#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total number of 315 participants were included in this survey study,, of which 118 (37.5%) were female. The mean age of the participants was 62.6 (SD 15.1) years. Cronbach a analysis yielded a score of >.7 in all domains of the DHRQ,, which indicates acceptable internal consistency. The fit indices of the confirmatory factor analysis showed a reasonably good fit: standardized root-mean-square residual=0.065,, root-mean-square error of approximation=0.098 (95% CI 0.09-0.106),, Tucker-Lewis fit index=0.895,, and comparative fit index=0.912.
36897627#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The DHRQ was developed as an easy-to-use,, short questionnaire to assess the digital readiness of patients in a routine clinical setting. Initial validation demonstrates good internal consistency,, and future research will be needed to externally validate the questionnaire. The DHRQ has the potential to be implemented as a useful tool to gain insight into the patients who are treated in a care pathway,, tailor digital care pathways to different patient populations,, and offer those with low digital readiness but high learnability appropriate education programs in order to let them take part in the digital pathways.

35799984#ABSTRACT##Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare and offers new tools in clinical research,, personalized medicine,, and medical diagnostics. Thyroid function tests represent an important asset for physicians in the diagnosis and monitoring of pathologies. Artificial intelligence tools can clearly assist physicians and specialists in laboratory medicine to optimize test prescription,, tests interpretation,, decision making,, process optimization,, and assay design. Our article is reviewing several of these aspects. As thyroid AI models rely on large data sets,, which often requires distributed learning from multi-center contributions,, this article also briefly discusses this issue.

24493765#ABSTRACT##Tele-emergency services provide immediate and synchronous audio/video connections,, most commonly between rural low-volume hospitals and an urban "hub" emergency department. We performed a systematic literature review to identify tele-emergency models and outcomes. We then studied a large tele-emergency service in the upper Midwest. We sent a user survey to all seventy-one hospitals that used the service and received 292 replies. We also conducted telephone interviews and site visits with ninety clinicians and administrators at twenty-nine of these hospitals. Participants reported that tele-emergency improves clinical quality,, expands the care team,, increases resources during critical events,, shortens time to care,, improves care coordination,, promotes patient-centered care,, improves the recruitment of family physicians,, and stabilizes the rural hospital patient base. However,, inconsistent reimbursement policy,, cross-state licensing barriers,, and other regulations hinder tele-emergency implementation. New value-based payment systems have the potential to reduce these barriers and accelerate tele-emergency expansion.

25469795#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#There are large numbers of health-related applications (apps) available in various app stores for many smartphone devices. Consequently,, increasing numbers of articles are attempting to evaluate the content and the quality of health-related smartphone apps for specific health conditions. The aim of this article is to describe and summarize the methodologies used to determine the quality of health-related apps targeting health consumers and to propose a set of criteria for evaluating the quality of smartphone health-related apps.
25469795#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#In 2013,, literature searches were performed using Medline and CINAHL,, and we included all articles that had the aim of assessing the quality of health-related smartphone apps. The assessment method used in these studies was summarized and scored using a set of quality criteria developed for this study.
25469795#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From 606 articles generated by the search,, only 10 met the inclusion criteria. Based on our quality criteria,, the mean score was 5.05 out of 8 (range,, 2-7). Eighty percent of the studies did not identify the app store country in which the apps were found. Forty percent of the studies did not clearly mention whether they only had assessed the app description or had downloaded the app content for evaluation. Sixty percent of the studies did not provide a list of the apps they had evaluated. Overall,, we identified six evaluation methodologies used to assess the quality of health-related apps described in RESULTS.
25469795#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This article provides a summary of currently used methods for assessing the quality of smartphone health-related apps and proposes a set of criteria to enable future studies to consistently review health-related app quality in a standardized manner.

35984688#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Over 325,,000 mobile health (mHealth) apps are available to download across various app stores. However,, quality assurance in this field of medicine remains relatively undefined. Globally,, around 84% of the population have access to mobile broadband networks. Given the potential for mHealth app use in health promotion and disease prevention,, their role in patient care worldwide is ever apparent. Quality assurance regulations both nationally and internationally will take time to develop. Frameworks such as the Mobile App Rating Scale and Enlight Suite have demonstrated potential for use in the interim. However,, these frameworks require adaptation to be suitable for international use.
35984688#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to modify the Enlight Suite,, a comprehensive app quality assessment methodology,, to improve its applicability internationally and to assess the preliminary validity and reliability of this modified tool in practice.
35984688#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A two-round Delphi study involving 7 international mHealth experts with varied backgrounds in health,, technology,, and clinical psychology was conducted to modify the Enlight Suite for international use and to improve its content validity. The Modified Enlight Suite (MES) was then used by 800 health care professionals and health care students in Ireland to assess a COVID-19 tracker app in an online survey. The reliability of the MES was assessed using Cronbach alpha,, while the construct validity was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis.

35984688#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The final version of the MES has 7 sections with 32 evaluating items. Of these items,, 5 were novel and based on consensus for inclusion by Delphi panel members. The MES has satisfactory reliability with a Cronbach alpha score of .925. The subscales also demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. Similarly,, the confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a positive and significant factor loading for all 32 items in the MES with a modestly acceptable model fit,, thus indicating the construct validity of the MES.
35984688#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Enlight Suite was modified to improve its international relevance to app quality assessment by introducing new items relating to cultural appropriateness,, accessibility,, and readability of mHealth app content. This study indicates both the reliability and validity of the MES for assessing the quality of mHealth apps in a high-income country,, with further studies being planned to extrapolate these findings to low- and middle-income countries.

34673981#ABSTRACT##High-quality mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have the potential to enhance the prevention,, diagnosis,, and treatment of burns. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether the quality of mHealth apps for burns care is being adequately assessed. The secondary aim was to determine whether these apps meet regulatory standards in the United Kingdom. We searched AMED,, BNI,, CINAHL,, Cochrane Library,, Embase,, Emcare,, Medline,, and PsychInfo to identify studies assessing mHealth app quality for burns. The PRISMA reporting guideline was adhered to. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts to identify relevant studies. The quality of identified studies was assessed according to the framework proposed by Nouri et al,, including design,, information/content,, usability,, functionality,, ethical issues,, security/privacy,, and user-perceived value. Of the 28 included studies,, none assessed all seven domains of quality. Design was assessed in 4 of 28 studies; information/content in 26 of 28 studies; usability in 12 of 28 studies; functionality in 10 of 28 studies; ethical issues were never assessed in any studies; security/privacy was not assessed; subjective assessment was made in 9 of 28 studies. About 17 of 28 studies included apps that met the definition of "medical device" according to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency guidance,, yet only one app was appropriately certified with the UK Conformity Assessed mark. The quality of mHealth apps for burns is not being adequately assessed. The majority of apps should be considered medical devices according to UK standards,, yet only one was appropriately certified. Regulatory bodies should support mHealth app developers,, so as to improve quality control while simultaneously fostering innovation.

35197241#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of mobile health (mHealth) apps continues to rise each year. Widespread use of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) has allowed objective and multidimensional evaluation of the quality of these apps. However,, no Japanese version of MARS has been made available to date.
35197241#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purposes of this study were (1) to develop a Japanese version of MARS and (2) to assess the translated version's reliability and validity in evaluating mHealth apps.
35197241#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To develop the Japanese version of MARS,, cross-cultural adaptation was used using a universalist approach. A total of 50 mental health apps were evaluated by 2 independent raters. Internal consistency and interrater reliability were then calculated. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed using multitrait scaling analysis and concurrent validity.
35197241#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After cross-cultural adaptation,, all 23 items from the original MARS were included in the Japanese version. Following translation,, back-translation,, and review by the author of the original MARS,, a Japanese version of MARS was finalized. Internal consistency was acceptable by all subscales of objective and subjective quality (Cronbach a=.78-.89). Interrater reliability was deemed acceptable,, with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ranging from 0.61 to 0.79 for all subscales,, except for "functionality,," which had an ICC of 0.40. Convergent/divergent validity and concurrent validity were also considered acceptable. The rate of missing responses was high in several items in the "information" subscale.
35197241#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A Japanese version of MARS was developed and shown to be reliable and valid to a degree that was comparable to the original MARS. This Japanese version of MARS can be used as a standard to evaluate the quality and credibility of mHealth apps.

34573267#ABSTRACT##There is increasing interest in the development and deployment of digital solutions to improve patient care and facilitate monitoring in medical practice,, e.g.,, by remote observation of disease symptoms in the patients' home environment. Digital health solutions today range from non-regulated wellness applications and research-grade exploratory instruments to regulated software as a medical device (SaMD). This paper discusses the considerations and complexities in developing innovative,, effective,, and validated SaMD for multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of SaMD requires a formalised approach (design control),, inclusive of technical verification and analytical validation to ensure reliability. SaMD must be clinically evaluated,, characterised for benefit and risk,, and must conform to regulatory requirements associated with device classification. Cybersecurity and data privacy are also critical. Careful consideration of patient and provider needs throughout the design and testing process help developers overcome challenges of adoption in medical practice. Here,, we explore the development pathway for SaMD in MS,, leveraging experiences from the development of Floodlight™ MS,, a continually evolving bundled solution of SaMD for remote functional assessment of MS. The development process will be charted while reflecting on common challenges in the digital space,, with a view to providing insights for future developers.

33825693#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical activity during pregnancy is associated with several health benefits for the mother and child. However,, very few women participate in regular physical activity during pregnancy. eHealth platforms (internet and mobile apps) have become an important information source for pregnant women. Although the use of pregnancy-related apps has significantly increased among pregnant women,, very little is known about their theoretical underpinnings,, including their utilization of behavior change techniques (BCTs). This is despite research suggesting that inclusion of BCTs in eHealth interventions are important for promoting healthy behaviors,, including physical activity.
33825693#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic search and content analysis of app quality,, features,, and the presence of BCTs in apps designed to promote physical activity among pregnant women.
33825693#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search in the Australian App Store and Google Play store using search terms relating to exercise and pregnancy was performed. App quality and features were assessed using the 19-item Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),, and a taxonomy of BCTs was used to determine the presence of BCTs (26 items). BCTs previously demonstrating efficacy in behavior changes during pregnancy were also identified from a literature review. Spearman correlations were used to investigate the relationships between app quality,, app features,, and number of BCTs identified.
33825693#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our findings showed that apps designed to promote physical activity among pregnant women were functional and aesthetically pleasing,, with overall moderate quality. However,, the incorporation of BCTs was low,, with limited prevalence of BCTs previously demonstrating efficacy in behavior change during pregnancy. Future app development should identify and adopt factors that enhance and encourage user engagement,, including the use of BCTs,, especially those that have demonstrated efficacy for promoting physical activity behavior change among pregnant women.

33825693#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Nineteen exercise apps were deemed eligible for this review and they were accessed via Google Play (n=13) or App Store (n=6). The MARS overall quality scores indicated moderate app quality (mean 3.5 [SD 0.52]). Functionality was the highest scoring MARS domain (mean 4.2 [SD 0.5]),, followed by aesthetics (mean 3.7 [SD 0.6]) and information quality (mean 3.16 [SD 0.42]). Subjective app quality (mean 2.54 [SD 0.64]) and likelihood for behavioral impact (mean 2.5 [SD 0.6]) were the lowest scoring MARS domains. All 19 apps were found to incorporate at least two BCTs (mean 4.74,, SD 2.51; range 2-10). However,, only 11 apps included BCTs that previously demonstrated efficacy for behavior change during pregnancy,, the most common being provide opportunities for social comparison (n=8) and prompt self-monitoring of behavior (n=7). There was a significant positive correlation between the number of BCTs with engagement and aesthetics scores,, but the number of BCTs was not significantly correlated with functionality,, information quality,, total MARS quality,, or subjective quality.

32808939#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Modern smartphones contain sophisticated high-end hardware features,, offering high computational capabilities at extremely manageable costs and have undoubtedly become an integral part in users' daily life. Additionally,, smartphones offer a well-established ecosystem that is easily discoverable and accessible via the marketplaces of differing mobile platforms,, thus encouraging the development of many smartphone apps. Such apps are not exclusively used for entertainment purposes but are also commonplace in health care and medical use. A variety of those health and medical apps exist within the context of tinnitus,, a phantom sound perception in the absence of any physical external source.
32808939#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this paper,, we shed light on existing smartphone apps addressing tinnitus by providing an up-to-date overview.
32808939#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Based on PRISMA guidelines,, we systematically searched and identified existing smartphone apps on the most prominent app markets,, namely Google Play Store and Apple App Store. In addition,, we applied the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate and assess the apps in terms of their general quality and in-depth user experience.
32808939#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our systematic search and screening of smartphone apps yielded a total of 34 apps (34 Android apps,, 26 iOS apps). The mean MARS scores (out of 5) ranged between 2.65-4.60. The Tinnitus Peace smartphone app had the lowest score (mean 2.65,, SD 0.20),, and Sanvello-Stress and Anxiety Help had the highest MARS score (mean 4.60,, SD 0.10). The interrater agreement was substantial (Fleiss ?=0.74),, the internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach a=.95),, and the interrater reliability was found to be both high and excellent-Guttman ?6=0.94 and intraclass correlation,, ICC(2,,k) 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.97),, respectively.
32808939#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This work demonstrated that there exists a plethora of smartphone apps for tinnitus. All of the apps received MARS scores higher than 2,, suggesting that they all have some technical functional value. However,, nearly all identified apps were lacking in terms of scientific evidence,, suggesting the need for stringent clinical validation of smartphone apps in future. To the best of our knowledge,, this work is the first to systematically identify and evaluate smartphone apps within the context of tinnitus.

35096411#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Today there are several health and medical apps (mHealth) in app stores. Germany is the world's first country that introduced apps paid by the regular health insurance service. Even though breast cancer is the most common cancer in women,, mHealth for breast cancer has been largely unexplored.
35096411#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 33 apps from two major mobile application marketplaces (Google Play Store/Android; App Store/iOS) have been selected for analysis.
35096411#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The app analysis shows that there are currently only 10 mHealth apps in German,, which are specifically dedicated to breast cancer patients. The features of these apps fall into two categories: improvement of health literacy and indirect intervention. These apps can be used for all phases of the patient journey starting with the diagnosis.
35096411#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#mHealth apps have the potential to support the adherence of breast cancer patients. In order to exploit this future potential,, the app quality,, as well as the information about the available apps,, must be urgently improved. Currently,, it is very difficult both for laypersons and for doctors/other therapists to identify high-quality apps. Guidance from independent or governmental institutions would be helpful to further the digitalization in health care.

30714547#ABSTRACT##Digital health technologies (DHTs) such as health apps are rapidly emerging as a major disruptor of health care. Yet there is no well-established process of decision making for selecting DHTs that are worthy of investing resources in their validation to determine whether they are ready (safe,, effective,, and not too costly) for health related use. We report here on an Ontario-based initiative to support such decision making. Specifically,, we developed a decision-making algorithm that uses approved criteria including the strategic direction of the health research institute and the hospital,, and availability of resources. The Council of Academic Hospitals of Ontario has adapted our approach for other hospitals. We hope that other healthcare organizations,, in and beyond Ontario,, will consider this and alternative approaches,, and that research will be conducted to evaluate such approaches.

34706123#ABSTRACT#AIM#To perform a systematic review of available mHealth apps for menstrual cycle monitoring in Brazil.
34706123#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search for menstrual cycle mHealth apps from the Google Play Store and AppStore in Brazil was performed by two independent reviewers on October 2020,, and the quality of eligible mHealth apps was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).
34706123#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our review identified 2400 potentially relevant mHealth apps,, of which 56 were eligible for inclusion. The majority of the apps offered tools to track menstruation symptoms (63%) and educational content for users (32%). The mean (?±SD) MARS app quality score for the 28 evaluated apps in Android was 3.5?±?0.6 on a 0-5 scale. For the 28 evaluated apps in iOS,, the mean app quality score was 3.8?±?0.4. Most of the included apps,, for both systems,, scored average for credibility,, user interface,, and engagement.
34706123#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The majority of available tools in Brazil are of moderate quality and limited functionality for menstrual cycle monitoring. This study highlights the top three mHealth apps available on each online store for individuals seeking menstrual cycle monitoring options.

35964383#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of mobile health apps (MHAs) is growing rapidly. MHAs have great potential to improve health and health care. However,, the quality of available MHAs remains unknown due to the lack of quality assessment regulations and standards for MHAs. The Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) is the most widely used instrument to assess the quality of MHAs,, and available in English,, Italian,, Spanish,, German,, French,, Arabic and Japanese. However,, the scale is currently not available in the Turkish language.
35964383#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the MARS into Turkish and evaluate the validity and reliability of the scale.
35964383#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The MARS was translated and adapted into Turkish according to the international guidelines. A total of 52 pregnancy tracking apps were evaluated by two independent raters. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha),, inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]),, convergent validity and concurrent validity were explored. Regarding convergent validity,, MARS-TR scores were compared with the ENLIGHT scale.
35964383#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The MARS-TR was highly aligned with the original MARS. The MARS-TR showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 for both raters) and excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.94; SEM = 0.02),, with a smallest detectable change (95 % confidence level) of 0.05 points for the total score. Cronbach's alphas for the subscales ranged from 0.76 to 0.94 for the two raters. Correlations between the MARS-TR and ENLIGHT demonstrated adequate convergent validity (P < 0.05). No ceiling or floor effects were observed.
35964383#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The results provide evidence that the Turkish version of MARS is a valid and reliable tool for researchers and experts to assess the quality of MHAs in Turkey.

32095769#ABSTRACT##The identification and application of biomarkers in the clinical and medical fields has an enormous impact on society. The increase of digital devices and the rise in popularity of health-related mobile apps has produced a new trove of biomarkers in large,, diverse,, and complex data. However,, the unclear definition of digital biomarkers,, population groups,, and their intersection with traditional biomarkers hinders their discovery and validation. We have identified current issues in the field of digital biomarkers and put forth suggestions to address them during the DayOne Workshop with participants from academia and industry. We have found similarities and differences between traditional and digital biomarkers in order to synchronize semantics,, define unique features,, review current regulatory procedures,, and describe novel applications that enable precision medicine.

27332425#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#One of the scales most used to measure quickly and easily eHealth Literacy is the eHealth LiteracyScale (eHEALS); however,, there was no validation of this scale in Italian. Therefore,, the aim of this study was to adapt and validate the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) to the italian context.
27332425#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Italian translation of eHEALS was administered along unit to another two scale for measure lifestyle habits self-esteem and life satisfaction). A sample of 650 university students aged between 18 and 45 years was selected. An exploratory factor analysis,, confirmatory factor analysis,, analysis of invariance,, reliability,, stability and bivariate correlations were performed.
27332425#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Exploratory factor analysis revealed a monofactorial structure that explained 67% of variance. Reliability of 0.87 and test-retest correlation of 0.78 was obtained. The questionnaire was invariant by gender. Regarding the criterion validity,, a statistically significant and positive correlations between 0.05 and 0.15 with three indicators was obtained (self-esteem,, lifestyle habits and life satisfaction). The italian version of the eHEALS tested in this work has shown to be a valid and reliable scale to measure eHealth competence in university students.

32130153#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper sought out competencies for mobile technologies and/or an approach to define them.
32130153#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A scoping review was conducted to answer the following research question,, "What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care via mHealth,, have they been published,, and how can they be made measurable and reproducible to teach and assess them?" The review was conducted in accordance with the 6-stage scoping review process starting with a keyword search in PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online,, APA PsycNET,, Cochrane,, EMBASE,, PsycINFO,, Web of Science,, and Scopus. The literature search focused on keywords in 4 concept areas: (1) competencies,, (2) mobile technologies,, (3) telemedicine mode,, and (4) health. Moreover,, 2 authors independently,, in parallel,, screened the search results for potentially relevant studies based on titles and abstracts. The authors reviewed the full-text articles for final inclusion based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were keywords used from concept area 1 (competencies) and 2 (mobile technologies) and either 3 (telemedicine mode) or 4 (health). Exclusion criteria included,, but were not limited to,, keywords used from a concept area in isolation,, discussion of skills abstractly,, outline or listing of what clinicians need without detail,, and listing immeasurable behaviors.
32130153#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Research is needed on how to customize implementation and evaluation of mHealth competencies and to ensure skill development is linked to the quality of care. This will require the management of organizational change with technology and the creation of a positive electronic culture in a complex policy and regulatory environment.

32130153#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From a total of 1232 results,, the authors found 78 papers eligible for a full-text review and found 14 papers directly relevant to the 4 key concepts. Although few studies specifically discussed skills,, the majority were clinical studies,, and the literature included no lists of measurable behaviors or competency sets for mobile technology. Therefore,, a framework for mobile technology competencies was built according to the review,, expert consensus,, and recommendations of the Institute of Medicine's Health Professions Education Summit and Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education framework. This framework borrows from existing competency framework domains in telepsychiatry and social media (patient care,, medical knowledge,, practice-based learning and improvement,, systems-based practice,, professionalism,, and interpersonal skills and communication) and added domains of mHealth clinical decision support,, device/technology assessment/selection,, and information flow management across an electronic health record platform. mHealth Asynchronous components require additional traditional learning,, teaching,, supervisory and evaluation practices. Interactive curricula with case-,, problem-,, and system-based teaching may help faculty focus on decision making and shape skills and attitudes to complement clinical exposure.

33620327#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This was a noninterventional,, validation study. We included patients with spinal cord injury presenting with a pressure ulcer,, regardless of its stage or location. We performed wound measurements with a ruler,, and we performed acetate tracing using a transparent dressing with a wound measurement grid. Wound evaluation via the mHealth app was conducted twice by the main investigator and also by a coinvestigator to determine validity,, intrarater reproducibility,, and interrater reproducibility. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to compute the minimal detectable change percentage.
33620327#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, 61 different pressure ulcers were included. The validity,, intrarater reproducibility,, and interrater reproducibility of the mHealth app vs acetate tracing (considered the method of reference) were good,, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.97 (95% CI 0.93-0.99),, 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99),, and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99),, respectively,, and minimal detectable change percentages between 17% and 35%.

34713066#ABSTRACT##The widespread adoption of digital health technologies such as smartphone-based mobile applications,, wearable activity trackers and Internet of Things systems has rapidly enabled new opportunities for predictive health monitoring. Leveraging digital health tools to track parameters relevant to human health is particularly important for the older segments of the population as old age is associated with multimorbidity and higher care needs. In order to assess the potential of these digital health technologies to improve health outcomes,, it is paramount to investigate which digitally measurable parameters can effectively improve health outcomes among the elderly population. Currently,, there is a lack of systematic evidence on this topic due to the inherent heterogeneity of the digital health domain and the lack of clinical validation of both novel prototypes and marketed devices. For this reason,, the aim of the current study is to synthesize and systematically analyse which digitally measurable data may be effectively collected through digital health devices to improve health outcomes for older people. Using a modified PICO process and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework,, we provide the results of a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis of digitally measurable predictors of morbidity,, hospitalization,, and mortality among older adults aged 65 or older. These findings can inform both technology developers and clinicians involved in the design,, development and clinical implementation of digital health technologies for elderly citizens.

33620327#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Clinical evaluation of a pressure ulcer is based on quantitative and qualitative evaluation. In clinical practice,, acetate tracing is the standard technique used to measure wound surface area; however,, it is difficult to use in daily practice (because of material availability,, data storage issues,, and time needed to calculate the surface area). Planimetry techniques developed with mobile health (mHealth) apps can be used to overcome these difficulties.
33620327#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this study was to evaluate the metrological properties of a free-access mHealth app,, called imitoMeasure,, to assess pressure ulcers.

35974395#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted by an overwhelming amount of online health information,, which can be valuable but also vary in quality and aim. Therefore,, it is of great importance for developers and providers of eHealth information to understand its impact on the users. The eHealth Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ) has been developed in the United Kingdom to measure the potential effects of health and experimental information websites. This contains user's general attitudes towards using the internet to gain health information and attitudes towards a specific health related website. The self-complete questionnaire is divided into two independently administered and scored parts: the 11-item eHIQ part 1 and the 26-item eHIQ part 2. This study aimed to validate the psychometric properties of the German version of the eHealth Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ-G).
35974395#ABSTRACT#METHODS#162 people with multiple sclerosis browsed one of two possible websites containing information on MS and completed an online survey. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha and structural validity by Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Construct validity was examined by assessing correlations with the reference instruments eHealth Literacy Questionnaire and the General Self-Efficacy Scale measuring related,, but dissimilar constructs. Moreover,, we investigated the mean difference of the eHIQ-G score between the two websites. Data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS software.
35974395#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The eHIQ-G subscales showed high internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha from 0.833 to 0.885. The 2-factor model of eHIQ part 1 achieved acceptable levels of goodness-of-fit indices,, whereas the fit for the 3-factor model of eHIQ part 2 was poor and likewise for the alternative modified models. The correlations with the reference instruments were 0.08-0.62 and as expected. Older age was related with lower eHIQ part 1 score,, whereas no significant effect was found for education on eHIQ part 1. Although not significant,, the website 'AMSEL' reached higher mean scores on eHIQ part 2.

35728358#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although the global market of Mobile Health Apps (mHealth apps) continues to grow dramatically,, most mHealth apps still not only lack evidence base but have even not been evaluated for the basic usability or functionality. The User Version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS) was developed to allow end users to assess mHealth apps objectively and subjectively. However,, there is no Japanese version of uMARS to date.
35728358#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study is (1) to develop a validated Japanese version of uMARS and (2) to assess the translated version's reliability and validity in evaluating mHealth apps.

35728358#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original uMARS was adapted for Japanese use by four specialists using universalist cross-cultural methods. Translation/back-translation was reviewed by the author of the original version of uMARS,, and confirmed. Its reliability and validity were further evaluated as part of a prospective cohort study of postoperative patients using a new mHealth app.
35728358#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Conceptual equivalence was analyzed and all items in all subcategories of the original uMARS were included in the Japanese version. Internal consistency was deemed acceptable for all subscales of objective and subjective quality with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.75-0.85. Test-retest reliability of all subscales was also acceptable with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.57-0.88. Convergent/divergent validity and concurrent validity were also considered acceptable.
35728358#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A Japanese version of uMARS was cross-culturally validated and found to be as reliable as the original uMARS. This Japanese version of uMARS is expected to become a standard tool in assessing the quality of mHealth apps in Japan.

36174414#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The timely and accurate diagnosis of ENT (Ear,, Nose,, and throat) diseases in deprived areas is very important due to the increased burden of the disease in high-risk populations. Therefore,, the purpose of this study is to identify,, validate and prioritize the information needs of stakeholders of a tele-otology system for diagnosing ear diseases and to provide a solution.
36174414#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#In this study,, to identify the information need of the stakeholders and prioritize them,, the spiral-iterative model was used. Data were obtained through direct observation,, interviews with 23 stakeholders (6 ENT specialist doctors,, 3 health center managers,, 2 patients,, and 12 health facilitators),, and a survey among all ENT specialists and residents (n = 49),, working in Kerman province,, Iran. Finally,, based on the study findings,, the important information needs of the stakeholders were considered as the input for developing the tele-otology software.
36174414#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the observation phase,, the workflow of the tele-otology system was developed. In the interview phase,, 4 main themes including patient information; Technology and communication; Policy,, guidelines,, and requirements; Facilitator skills and knowledge were determined. In total,, the four categories of the iterative-spiral model including strategic,, patient information,, commercial and technical with 8,, 9,, 3,, and 9 sub-categories,, respectively,, were prioritized by specialists which were considered as input for system development.

33330344#ABSTRACT##Background: The unequal access,, challenges and outcomes related to using technology have created the digital divide,, which leads to health inequalities. The aim of this study was to apply the Ophelia (Optimizing Health Literacy and Access) process,, a widely used systematic approach to whole of community co-design,, to the digital context to generate solutions to improve health and equity outcomes. Methods: This was a mixed method study. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken at 3 health organizations in Victoria,, Australia using the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) as a needs assessment tool. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify subgroups with varying eHealth literacy needs. These data,, combined with semi-structured interviews with clients,, were used to generate vignettes representing different eHealth literacy profiles. The vignettes were presented at co-design workshops with clients and health professionals to generate solutions for digital health services improvement. Expert validation and proof-of-concept testing was explored through mapping the process against Ophelia guiding principles. Results: The cluster analyses identified 8 to 9 clusters with different profiles of eHealth literacy needs,, with 4 to 6 vignettes developed to represent the eHealth literacy strengths and weaknesses of clients at each of the 3 sites. A total of 32,, 43,, and 32 solutions across 10 strategies were co-created based on ideas grounded in local expertise and experiences. Apart from digital solutions,, non-digital solutions were frequently recommended as a strategy to address eHealth literacy needs. Expert validation identified at least half of the ideas were very important and feasible,, while most of the guiding principles of the Ophelia process were successfully applied. Conclusion: By harnessing collective creativity through co-design,, the Ophelia process has been shown to assist the development of solutions with the potential to improve health and equity outcomes in the digital context. Implementation of the solutions is needed to provide further evidence of the impact of the process. The suggested inclusion of non-digital solutions revealed through the co-design process reminds health organizations and policymakers that solutions should be flexible enough to suit individual needs. As such,, taking a co-design approach to digital health initiatives will assist in preventing the widening of health inequalities.

36174414#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#By applying the spiral-iterative model,, the prototype included a mobile app and server system was developed. In the final solution,, the possibility of capturing patient history and video images was provided for facilitators to help physicians in effective diagnosis. The results of this study,, while identifying the workflow of service providers and determining their information needs can help telemedicine system developers to have an optimal design when designing systems for the diagnosis of ear disease.
35044316#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Wearable technology has the potential to improve cardiovascular health monitoring by using machine learning. Such technology enables remote health monitoring and allows for the diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the detection of cardiovascular disease,, it can exclude this diagnosis in symptomatic patients,, thereby preventing unnecessary hospital visits. In addition,, early warning systems can aid cardiologists in timely treatment and prevention.
35044316#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to systematically assess the literature on detecting and predicting outcomes of patients with cardiovascular diseases by using machine learning with data obtained from wearables to gain insights into the current state,, challenges,, and limitations of this technology.
35044316#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched PubMed,, Scopus,, and IEEE Xplore on September 26,, 2020,, with no restrictions on the publication date and by using keywords such as "wearables,," "machine learning,," and "cardiovascular disease." Methodologies were categorized and analyzed according to machine learning-based technology readiness levels (TRLs),, which score studies on their potential to be deployed in an operational setting from 1 to 9 (most ready).
35044316#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After the removal of duplicates,, application of exclusion criteria,, and full-text screening,, 55 eligible studies were included in the analysis,, covering a variety of cardiovascular diseases. We assessed the quality of the included studies and found that none of the studies were integrated into a health care system (TRL<6),, prospective phase 2 and phase 3 trials were absent (TRL<7 and 8),, and group cross-validation was rarely used. These issues limited these studies' ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methodologies. Furthermore,, there seemed to be no agreement on the sample size needed to train these studies' models,, the size of the observation window used to make predictions,, how long participants should be observed,, and the type of machine learning model that is suitable for predicting cardiovascular outcomes.
35044316#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Although current studies show the potential of wearables to monitor cardiovascular events,, their deployment as a diagnostic or prognostic cardiovascular clinical tool is hampered by the lack of a realistic data set and proper systematic and prospective evaluation.

32576430#ABSTRACT##Telepathology has been an important application for second opinion consultation ever since the introduction of digital pathology. However,, little is known regarding teleconsultation for second opinion in transplantation. There is also limited literature on telepathology during organ donor procurement,, typically utilized when general pathologists on-call request back-up to help assess donor biopsies for organ suitability or to diagnose newly discovered tumors with urgent time constraints. In this review,, we searched Pubmed/Embase and websites of transplant organizations to collect and analyze published evidence on teleconsultation for donor evaluation and organ procurement. Of 2725 records retrieved using the key terms 'telepathology',, 'second opinion' and 'transplantation',, 26 suitable studies were included. Most records were from North America and included validation studies of telepathology being used for remote frozen section interpretation of donor biopsies with whole slide imaging. The data from these published studies supports the transition towards digital teleconsultation in transplant settings where consultations among pathologists are still handled by pathologists being called on site,, via telephone and/or email.

34855618#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There are several mobile health (mHealth) apps in mobile app stores. These apps enter the business-to-customer market with limited controls. Both,, apps that users use autonomously and those designed to be recommended by practitioners require an end-user validation to minimize the risk of using apps that are ineffective or harmful. Prior studies have reviewed the most relevant aspects in a tool designed for assessing mHealth app quality,, and different options have been developed for this purpose. However,, the psychometric properties of the mHealth quality measurement tools,, that is,, the validity and reliability of the tools for their purpose,, also need to be studied. The Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative has developed tools for selecting the most suitable measurement instrument for health outcomes,, and one of the main fields of study was their psychometric properties.
34855618#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to address and psychometrically analyze,, following the COSMIN guideline,, the quality of the tools that are used to measure the quality of mHealth apps.
34855618#ABSTRACT#METHODS#From February 1,, 2019,, to December 31,, 2019,, 2 reviewers searched PubMed and Embase databases,, identifying mHealth app quality measurement tools and all the validation studies associated with each of them. For inclusion,, the studies had to be meant to validate a tool designed to assess mHealth apps. Studies that used these tools for the assessment of mHealth apps but did not include any psychometric validation were excluded. The measurement tools were analyzed according to the 10 psychometric properties described in the COSMIN guideline. The dimensions and items analyzed in each tool were also analyzed.
34855618#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The initial search showed 3372 articles. Only 10 finally met the inclusion criteria and were chosen for analysis in this review,, analyzing 8 measurement tools. Of these tools,, 4 validated =5 psychometric properties defined in the COSMIN guideline. Although some of the tools only measure the usability dimension,, other tools provide information such as engagement,, esthetics,, or functionality. Furthermore,, 2 measurement tools,, Mobile App Rating Scale and mHealth Apps Usability Questionnaire,, have a user version,, as well as a professional version.
34855618#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale and the Measurement Scales for Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use were the most validated tools,, but they were very focused on usability. The Mobile App Rating Scale showed a moderate number of validated psychometric properties,, measures a significant number of quality dimensions,, and has been validated in a large number of mHealth apps,, and its use is widespread. It is suggested that the continuation of the validation of this tool in other psychometric properties could provide an appropriate option for evaluating the quality of mHealth apps.

33606386#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#There is a need for a simple and accurate way to assess visual acuity in telemedicine consultations in ophthalmology and other related specialties.
33606386#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#We surveyed visual acuity testing apps available that allow patients to measure their own acuity,, focusing on freely accessible resources suitable for all resource settings.
33606386#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search was performed for visual acuity testing apps on 2 major platforms: Google Play Store (Google,, CA,, USA) and Apple App Store (Apple,, CA,, USA).
33606386#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Sixteen apps (67%) tested near vision,, 5 apps (21%) tested distance vision,, and 3 apps (13%) offered options for both near and distance vision testing. Of the 24 apps,, 5 (21%) offered a method of calibration of optotype size. Three apps (13%) demonstrated evidence of clinical validation. Only 3 apps fulfilled our criteria for suitability for clinical practice.
33606386#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We have recommended 3 apps that may be quickly integrated into clinical practice in both ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic all resource settings.

37143005#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) services can not give full play to their value if only it is used in the short term,, and their continuous usage can achieve better effects in health management. This study aims to explore the factors that affect continuous usage intentions of mHealth services and their mechanism of action.
37143005#ABSTRACT#METHODS#First,, considering the uniqueness of health services and social environmental factors,, this study constructed an extended Expectation Confirmation Model of Information System Continuance (ECM-ISC) to investigate factors that may influence the intention of continuous usage of mHealth services based on three dimensions,, namely individual characteristics,, technology and environment. Second,, the survey method was used to validate the research model. The questionnaire items were derived from validated instruments and discussed by experts and data were collected both online and offline. The structural equation model was used for data analysis.
37143005#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The study constructed a new theoretical model including E-health literacy,, subjective norm and technology qualities to clarify continuous usage intention of mHealth services,, and empirically validated the model. Attention should be paid to E-health literacy,, subjective norm,, perceived information quality,, and perceived service quality to improve continuous usage intention of users and self-management by mHealth Apps managers and governments. This research provides solid evidence for the validity of the expanded model of ECM-ISC in the mHealth field,, which can be a theoretical and practical basis for mHealth operators' product research and development.
37143005#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There were 334 avidity questionnaires through cross-sectional data and these participants had used mHealth services ever. The reliability and validity of the test model were good,, in which Cronbach's Alpha values of 9 variables exceeded 0.9,, composite reliability 0.8,, the average variance extracted value 0.5,, and the factor loading 0.8. The modified model had a good fitting effect and strong explanatory power. It accounted for 89% of the variance in expectation confirmation,, 74% of the variance in perceived usefulness,, 92% of the variance in customer satisfaction,, and 84% of the variance in continuous usage intention. Compared with the initial model hypotheses,, perceived system quality was deleted according to the heterotrait-monotrait ratio,, so paths related to it were deleted; perceived usefulness wasn't positively associated with customer satisfaction,, and its path was also deleted. Other paths were consistent with the initial hypothesis. The two new added paths were that subjective norm was positively associated with perceived service quality (ß?=?0.704,, P?<?0.001),, and perceived information quality (ß?=?0.606,, P?<?0.001). Electronic health literacy (E-health literacy) was positively associated with perceived usefulness (ß?=?0.379,, P?<?0.001),, perceived service quality (ß?=?0.200,, P?<?0.001),, and perceived information quality (ß?=?0.320,, P?<?0.001). Continuous usage intention was influenced by perceived usefulness (ß?=?0.191,, P?<?0.001),, customer satisfaction (ß?=?0.453,, P?<?0.001),, and subjective norm (ß?=?0.372,, P?<?0.001).

33538704#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) apps play an important role in delivering education,, providing advice on treatment,, and monitoring patients' health. Good usability of mHealth apps is essential to achieve the objectives of mHealth apps efficiently. To date,, there are questionnaires available to assess the general system usability but not explicitly tailored to precisely assess the usability of mHealth apps. Hence,, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was developed with 4 versions according to the type of app (interactive or standalone) and according to the target user (patient or provider). Standalone MAUQ for patients comprises 3 subscales,, which are ease of use,, interface and satisfaction,, and usefulness.
33538704#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to translate and validate the English version of MAUQ (standalone for patients) into a Malay version of MAUQ (M-MAUQ) for mHealth app research and usage in future in Malaysia.
33538704#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Forward and backward translation and harmonization of M-MAUQ were conducted by Malay native speakers who also spoke English as their second language. The process began with a forward translation by 2 independent translators followed by harmonization to produce an initial translated version of M-MAUQ. Next,, the forward translation was continued by another 2 translators who had never seen the original MAUQ. Lastly,, harmonization was conducted among the committee members to resolve any ambiguity and inconsistency in the words and sentences of the items derived with the prefinal adapted questionnaire. Subsequently,, content and face validations were performed with 10 experts and 10 target users,, respectively. Modified kappa statistic was used to determine the interrater agreement among the raters. The reliability of the M-MAUQ was assessed by 51 healthy young adult mobile phone users. Participants needed to install the MyFitnessPal app and use it for 2 days for familiarization before completing the designated task and answer the M-MAUQ. The MyFitnessPal app was selected because it is one among the most popular installed mHealth apps globally available for iPhone and Android users and represents a standalone mHealth app.
33538704#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The content validity index for the relevancy and clarity of M-MAUQ were determined to be 0.983 and 0.944,, respectively,, which indicated good relevancy and clarity. The face validity index for understandability was 0.961,, which indicated that users understood the M-MAUQ. The kappa statistic for every item in M-MAUQ indicated excellent agreement between the raters (? ranging from 0.76 to 1.09). The Cronbach a for 18 items was .946,, which also indicated good reliability in assessing the usability of the mHealth app.
33538704#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The M-MAUQ fulfilled the validation criteria as it revealed good reliability and validity similar to the original version. M-MAUQ can be used to assess the usability of mHealth apps in Malay in the future.

36689840#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Healthcare professionals' digital health competence is an important phenomenon to study as healthcare practices are changing globally. Recent research aimed to define this complex phenomenon and identify the current state of healthcare professionals' competence in digitalisation but did not include an overarching outlook when measuring digital health competence of healthcare professionals.
36689840#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The purpose of this study was to develop and psychometrically validate two self-assessed instruments measuring digital health competence and factors associating with it.
36689840#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study followed three phases of instrument development and validation: 1) conceptualisation and item pool generation; 2) content validity testing and pilot study; and 3) construct validity and reliability testing. The conceptual background of the instruments was based on individual interviews conducted with healthcare professionals (n = 20) and previous systematic reviews. A total of 17 experts assessed the instrument's content validity. Face validity was evaluated by a group of healthcare professionals (n = 20). Data collection from 817 professionals took place in spring-summer 2022 in nine organisations. Construct validity was confirmed with exploratory factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of the instruments.
36689840#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The instrument development and validation process resulted in two instruments: DigiHealthCom and DigiComInf. DigiHealthCom included 42 items in 5 factors related to digital health competence,, and DigiComInf included 15 items in 3 factors related to educational and organisational factors associated with digital health competence. The DigiHealthCom instrument explained 68.9 % of the total variance and the factors' Cronbach alpha values varied between 0.91 and 0.97. The DigiComInf instrument explained 59.6 % of the total variance and the factors' Cronbach alpha values varied between 0.76 and 0.88.
36689840#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The two instruments gave valid and reliable results in psychometric testing. The instruments could be used to evaluate healthcare professionals' digital health competence and associated factors.

36673768#ABSTRACT##Digital health tools,, such as apps,, have the potential to promote healthy behaviours,, especially self-monitoring,, which can facilitate pregnancy management and reduce the risk of associated pregnancy health conditions. While pregnancy apps are popular amongst pregnant women,, there is limited information about the overall quality of their content or self-monitoring tools and the number of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) that they include. The aim of this study was thus to assess the quality of pregnancy apps for self-monitoring,, and their usage of BCTs. We identified pregnancy apps by web scraping the most popular global apps for self-monitoring in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store available in Australia. The app quality was evaluated using the scorecard approach and the inclusion of BCTs was evaluated using the ABACUS tool. We identified 31 pregnancy apps that met our eligibility criteria. We found that pregnancy apps tended to score the highest in the domains of 'cost and time',, 'usability',, and 'technical',, and lowest on 'clinical' and 'end-user requirements'. Additionally,, the majority of apps contained minimal BCTs. Based on our findings,, we propose a digital health scorecard visualisation that would break down app quality criteria and present them in a more accessible way to clinicians and pregnant users. We conclude that these findings highlight the shortcomings of available commercial pregnancy apps and the utility of a digital health scorecard visualisation that would empower users to make more informed decisions about which apps are the most appropriate for their needs.

23920728#ABSTRACT##Australia is experiencing challenges in its health workforce profile to embrace reforms based on ehealth. Although there is much literature on the importance of ehealth education,, our study shows that ehealth education for entry-level clinicians is not meeting the demands for a technologically savvy clinical health workforce. This poster reports on a nationally funded project <fnr rid="fn001" /><fn id="fn001">Support for this project has been provided by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching. The views in this project do not necessarily reflect the views of the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching. </fn> which examines ehealth education for the future clinical workforce in Australia. It discusses 3 key components: the current state of teaching,, learning and assessment of ehealth education in health profession degrees in Australia; inclusion of ehealth competencies in accreditation guidelines of health profession degrees and ehealth skills and competencies in job descriptions for the future Australian clinical workforce. It is based on a systems view methodology that these three components are interrelated and influence the development of an ehealth capable health workforce. Results highlight that further research and development across the health workforce is needed before the education of future clinical health professionals can keep pace with the changes that ehealth is bringing to the Australian healthcare system.
36407680#ABSTRACT##COVID-19 is a new disease in human life and has become pandemic. Pandemic Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has been speeding up digital transformation in every sector. Implementation of digital technology in health should be supported by the community's readiness,, such as digital health literacy to achieve the goals,, optimize health service performance,, and blockage infodemics and miss information. Implementation of digital technology in health should be supported by the community's readiness,, such as digital health literacy to achieve the goals,, optimize health service performance,, and blockage infodemics and miss information. This study aims to develop a tool to measure digital health literacy in the community through three stages such as expert review,, pre-test and field test. DHLC adopted the five competencies areas into 18 questions and put eight questions related to health literacy; the total items question of DHLC are 26 items questions. This study reveals that all of the score digital competencies areas below 4. Score 4 in DHLC indicates that the community still need guidance to doing activity in the digital environment. Elevating digital health literacy in the citizens is urgent to control the spreading misinformation and disinformation that could worsen pandemics. Future studies need to conduct to test the validity and reliability of DHLC in various settings.

28501982#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#The number of available applications related to arterial hypertension and their usage by smartphone owners is constantly increasing. However,, most applications lack standardization and scientific validation,, and security flaws could be an important,, yet still underrated,, issue. Small studies showed that treatment strategies based on telemonitoring of home blood pressure with mobile applications could improve blood pressure control,, but there are no data on strong outcomes and the high heterogeneity of available studies severely limits the possibility of reaching a definitive conclusion on the impact of such strategies. Smartphone applications for arterial hypertension represent a great chance to improve management of this condition. Results from small studies are promising,, but there is a strong need for large,, long-term,, well-designed clinical trials,, before these potential solutions might be reliably applied in real-life patients' care.

25907269#ABSTRACT#METHOD#A review was conducted to assess the evidence supporting use of e-mental health programmes for treating depression. From the review,, models of dissemination and gaps in translation were identified,, with a specific focus on characterising barriers and facilitators to uptake within the Australian healthcare context. Finally,, recommendations for promoting the translation of e-mental health services in Australia were developed.
25907269#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There are a number of effective and cost-effective e-health applications available for treating depression in community and clinical settings. Four primary models of dissemination were identified: unguided,, health service-supported,, private ownership and clinically guided. Barriers to translation include clinician reluctance,, consumer awareness,, structural barriers such as funding and gaps in the translational evidence base.
25907269#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Key strategies for increasing use of e-mental health programmes include endorsement of e-mental health services by government entities,, education for clinicians and consumers,, adequate funding of e-mental health services,, development of an accreditation system,, development of translation-focused activities and support for further translational research. The impact of these implementation strategies is likely to include economic gains,, reductions in disease burden and greater availability of more interventions for prevention and treatment of mental ill-health complementary to existing health and efficient evidence-based mental health services.
33739480#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#mHealth applications (apps) for addictive behaviours offer widespread provision of digital support,, with particular benefits for stigmatized groups and those with poor access to treatment services. Regulation and accreditation may encourage the uptake and use of evidence-based addictive behaviour apps,, yet this is a complex and confusing landscape. We navigate international regulatory and accreditation guidance,, explore some of the implementation challenges and provide implications for app developers,, health-care professionals and app users.
33739480#ABSTRACT#ANALYSIS#We explore the classification of health and wellbeing,, blended support and clinical therapy apps as medical devices by country to help readers navigate the complexity of the guidance. We describe an addictive behaviour app classified as a medical device and explore the innovative approaches to regulation that are currently emerging. We discuss the use of curated on-line app libraries that adhere to thresholds for characteristics such as quality,, user satisfaction or effectiveness,, which we hope will become the starting-point in the search for suitable apps,, rather than commercial app stores. We also explore the ethical concerns associated with apps and how curated libraries address these.
33739480#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#International regulation of applications as medical devices varies across countries and would benefit from standardization in a simple,, usable and transparent format. Efforts to provide accreditation of non-medical device applications are also variable,, and public bodies provide mixed messages concerning endorsement. Health-care professionals and users are encouraged to use accredited applications for addictive behaviours where they exist,, or explore other forms of digital intervention with a stronger evidence base.

34515522#ABSTRACT##Background:The COVID-19 pandemic prompted health organizations to use telemedicine as an option to continue providing medical services. There is no telemedicine patient satisfaction survey validated in Spanish.Aim of the study:To develop and validate a telemedicine patient satisfaction survey and know the level of satisfaction with this type of consultation implemented at Hospital Clinica Nova during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods:This was a qualitative study implemented in a private hospital in Monterrey,, Mexico,, of patients who attended telemedicine from April to August 2020. Content validity was obtained by a two-round Delphi study with the participation of 11 experts. We conducted six patient interviews for the apparent validity of the items. The questionnaire was administered to 120 patients for statistical analysis. We made an item reduction by interitem and item-total correlation analyses,, stability validation by a test-retest,, a test of reliability by Cronbach's alpha,, and extraction of factors by a factorial analysis.Results:We obtained a validated nine-item questionnaire,, eight items on a Likert scale (range 1-7),, and one for a Net Promoter Score (NPS). Two factors explained the structure of the questionnaire and it had an Cronbach alpha?=?0.86. The mean population satisfaction score was 6.35 and 43% in NPS.Discussion:In general,, good satisfaction results were obtained,, and most patients considered telemedicine as good as face-to-face consultation.Conclusions:The scale developed was valid and reliable for the hospital population. However,, due to the characteristics of the items,, it may apply to other Spanish-speaking health organizations that use telemedicine for patient care.

32312794#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#While there are numerous mental health apps on the market today,, less is known about their safety and quality. This study aims to offer a longitudinal perspective on the nature of high visibility apps for common mental health and physical health conditions.
32312794#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In July 2019,, we selected the 10 top search-returned apps in the Apple App Store and Android Google Play Store using six keyword terms: depression,, anxiety,, schizophrenia,, addiction,, high blood pressure and diabetes. Each app was downloaded by two authors and reviewed by a clinician,, and the app was coded for features,, functionality,, claims,, app store properties,, and other properties.
32312794#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Compared with 1?year prior,, there were few statistically significant changes in app privacy policies,, evidence and features. However,, there was a high rate of turnover with only 34 (57%) of the apps from the Apple's App Store and 28 (47%) from the Google Play Store remaining in the 2019 top 10 search compared with the 2018 search.
32312794#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Although there was a high turnover of top search-returned apps between 2018 and 2019,, we found that there were few significant changes in features,, privacy,, medical claims and other properties. This suggests that,, although the highly visible and available apps are changing,, there were no significant improvements in app quality or safety.

24464237#ABSTRACT##Despite the potential of telehealth services to increase the quality and accessibility of healthcare,, the success rate of such services has been disappointing. The purpose of this paper is to find and compare existing frameworks for the implementation of telehealth services that can contribute to the success rate of future endeavors. After a thorough discussion of these frameworks,, this paper outlines the development methodologies in terms of theoretical background,, methodology and validation. Finally,, the common themes and formats are identified for consideration in future implementation. It was confirmed that a holistic implementation approach is needed,, which includes technology,, organizational structures,, change management,, economic feasibility,, societal impacts,, perceptions,, user-friendliness,, evaluation and evidence,, legislation,, policy and governance. Furthermore,, there is some scope for scientifically rigorous framework development and validation approaches.

34287209#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Several reviews of mobile health (mHealth) physical activity (PA) interventions suggest their beneficial effects on behavior change in adolescents and adults. Owing to the ubiquitous presence of smartphones,, their use in mHealth PA interventions seems obvious; nevertheless,, there are gaps in the literature on the evaluation reporting processes and best practices of such interventions.
34287209#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The primary objective of this review is to analyze the development and evaluation trajectory of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions and to review systematic theory- and evidence-based practices and methods that are implemented along this trajectory. The secondary objective is to identify the range of evidence (both quantitative and qualitative) available on smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions to provide a comprehensive tabular and narrative review of the available literature in terms of its nature,, features,, and volume.
34287209#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies examining smartphone-based PA interventions published between 2008 and 2018. In line with scoping review guidelines,, studies were not rejected based on their research design or quality. This review,, therefore,, includes experimental and descriptive studies,, as well as reviews addressing smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA in all age groups (with a subanalysis conducted for adolescents). Two groups of studies were additionally included: reviews or content analyses of PA trackers and meta-analyses exploring behavior change techniques and their efficacy.
34287209#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Included articles (N=148) were categorized into 10 groups: commercial smartphone app content analyses,, smartphone-based intervention review studies,, activity tracker content analyses,, activity tracker review studies,, meta-analyses of PA intervention studies,, smartphone-based intervention studies,, qualitative formative studies,, app development descriptive studies,, qualitative follow-up studies,, and other related articles. Only 24 articles targeted children or adolescents (age range: 5-19 years). There is no agreed evaluation framework or taxonomy to code or report smartphone-based PA interventions. Researchers did not state the coding method,, used various evaluation frameworks,, or used different versions of behavior change technique taxonomies. In addition,, there is no consensus on the best behavior change theory or model that should be used in smartphone-based interventions for PA promotion. Commonly reported systematic practices and methods have been successfully identified. They include PA recommendations,, trial designs (randomized controlled trials,, experimental trials,, and rapid design trials),, mixed methods data collection (surveys,, questionnaires,, interviews,, and focus group discussions),, scales to assess app quality,, and industry-recognized reporting guidelines.
34287209#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA showed promising results for behavior change. Although there is a plethora of published studies on the adult target group,, the number of studies and consequently the evidence base for adolescents is limited. Overall,, the efficacy of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions can be considerably improved through a more systematic approach of developing,, reporting,, and coding of the interventions.

34009645#ABSTRACT##Current developments in sensors and actuators are heralding a new era to facilitate things to happen effortlessly and efficiently with proper communication. On the other hand,, Internet of Things (IoT) has been boomed up with er potential and occupies a wide range of disciplines. This study has choreographed to design of an algorithm and a smart data-processing scheme to implement the obtained data from the sensing system to transmit to the receivers. Technically,, it is called "telediagnosis" and "remote digital monitoring,," a revolution in the field of medicine and artificial intelligence. For the proof of concept,, an algorithmic approach has been implemented for telediagnosis with one of the degenerative diseases,, that is,, Parkinson's disease. Using the data acquired from an improved interdigitated electrode,, sensing surface was evaluated with the attained sensitivity of 100 fM (n = 3),, and the limit of detection was calculated with the linear regression value coefficient. By the designed algorithm and data processing with the assistance of IoT,, further validation was performed and attested the coordination. This proven concept can be ideally used with all sensing strategies for immediate telemedicine by end-to-end communications.

26964880#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There are thousands of apps promoting dietary improvement,, increased physical activity (PA) and weight management. Despite a growing number of reviews in this area,, popular apps have not been comprehensively analysed in terms of features related to engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, information quality,, and content,, including the types of change techniques employed.
26964880#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The databases containing information about all Health and Fitness apps on GP and iTunes (7,,954 and 25,,491 apps) were downloaded in April 2015. Database filters were applied to select the most popular apps available in both stores. Two researchers screened the descriptions selecting only weight management apps. Features,, app quality and content were independently assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and previously-defined categories of techniques relevant to behaviour change. Inter-coder reliabilities were calculated,, and correlations between features explored.
26964880#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 23 popular apps included in the review 16 were free (70%),, 15 (65%) addressed weight control,, diet and PA combined; 19 (83%) allowed behavioural tracking. On 5-point MARS scales,, apps were of average quality (Md?=?3.2,, IQR?=?1.4); "functionality" (Md?=?4.0,, IQR?=?1.1) was the highest and "information quality" (Md?=?2.0,, IQR?=?1.1) was the lowest domain. On average,, 10 techniques were identified per app (range: 1-17) and of the 34 categories applied,, goal setting and self-monitoring techniques were most frequently identified. App quality was positively correlated with number of techniques included (rho?=?.58,, p?<?.01) and number of "technical" features (rho?=?.48,, p?<?.05),, which was also associated with the number of techniques included (rho?=?.61,, p?<?.01). Apps that provided tracking used significantly more techniques than those that did not. Apps with automated tracking scored significantly higher in engagement,, aesthetics,, and overall MARS scores. Those that used change techniques previously associated with effectiveness (i.e.,, goal setting,, self-monitoring and feedback) also had better "information quality".
26964880#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Popular apps assessed have overall moderate quality and include behavioural tracking features and a range of change techniques associated with behaviour change. These apps may influence behaviour,, although more attention to information quality and evidence-based content are warranted to improve their quality.

36156647#ABSTRACT##Mobile applications (Apps) may become effective aids in health care. Health Apps could reduce barriers such as access and costs and could be used to monitor symptoms,, behaviors and even treatments. There is more evidence of their usefulness in nutrition,, cardiovascular and mental health. Despite this,, its current use is predominantly for information purposes. Healthcare App quality evaluation should consider both clinical and technological aspects since the evidence on its clinical effectiveness is still incipient and they have associated risks. In Chile,, the use of mobile technology and Apps is increasing,, but there are no regulations for their use. There are few national institutions oriented to the creation and development of Apps for healthcare,, highlighting the Digital Transformation Committee,, part of the Corporation for the Promotion of Production (CORFO) and the National Center for Health Information Systems (CENS). General recommendations for healthcare App development and use have been established. In this process,, it would be beneficial to include actors involved in care. Given the progress of healthcare Apps worldwide and nationally,, it is important that health professionals develop digital skills to maximize the potential benefit of these technologies.

32319965#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Different strategies encompassed within mHealth have shown themselves to be effective for maintaining good health or controlling certain diseases. However,, there is usually a very high rate of abandonment of health apps. Therefore,, it would seem obvious that there is a need for involving the end users (whether they are health professionals,, patients,, or both) in the design process from the early stages in order to enable their needs and characteristics to be identified. In this sense,, it is common knowledge that focusing on the user permits the consideration of valuable details aimed at making the correct adjustment between the patient,, the technology,, and the organization of attention.
32319965#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of the research was to propose a methodology based on the review of previous successful user experiences in setting up health apps by using qualitative techniques (focus groups and discussion groups) that includes the participation of information technology and health professionals and the patients themselves.
32319965#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An integrative review was made of studies in which a qualitative methodology was employed mainly through focus and/or discussion groups for the design and development of health apps,, consulting diverse databases (PubMed,, Scopus,, and Proquest) with the following search strategy: "mHealth AND apps AND focus group OR discussion group." A total of 69 papers were included in the review.

32319965#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A proposal structured in 4 sessions of variable duration was made in which information technology and health professionals and patients take part: composing,, preparing,, and organizing contents (session 1); testing structure and usability (session 2); does the app fit the needs of end users? (session 3); and last testing-keep on improving (session 4). Throughout the sessions,, we propose studying aspects like previous user experiences in mHealth,, barriers to the adoption of mHealth,, interface contents,, management and browsability,, usability,, perceived quality,, security and privacy,, capacity to self-manage disease with the app,, ergonomics,, and glanceability,, etc. Specific tools that have proved useful in previous research for measuring these aspects are presented.
32319965#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These work sessions would be based on predominantly qualitative methodologies although,, as they evolve,, validated questionnaires permitting the assessment of the objectivity of certain technical aspects could be incorporated. With this proposal,, a project centered on end users could be effected,, responding to their needs. However,, this requires validation that will be made via implementation in the development of health apps,, with the subsequent measurement of results in terms of adherence and improvement in the clinical variables of the end users.

34603973#ABSTRACT##Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) offer an effective way to complement health care. Acceptance of IMI,, a key facilitator of their implementation in routine care,, is often low. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT),, this study validates and adapts the UTAUT to digital health care. Following a systematic literature search,, 10 UTAUT-grounded original studies (N = 1588) assessing patients' and health professionals' acceptance of IMI for different somatic and mental health conditions were included. All included studies assessed Performance Expectancy,, Effort Expectancy,, Social Influence,, Facilitating Conditions and acceptance as well as age,, gender,, internet experience,, and internet anxiety via self-report questionnaires. For the model validation primary data was obtained and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The best fitting model (RMSEA = 0.035,, SRMR = 0.029) replicated the basic structure of UTAUT's core predictors of acceptance. Performance Expectancy was the strongest predictor (? = 0.68,, p < .001). Internet anxiety was identified as an additional determinant of acceptance (? = -0.07,, p < .05) and moderated the effects of Social Influence (? = 0.07,, p < .05) and Effort Expectancy (? = -0.05,, p < .05). Age,, gender and experience had no moderating effects. Acceptance is a fundamental prerequisite for harnessing the full potential of IMI. The adapted UTAUT provides a powerful model identifying important factors - primarily Performance Expectancy - to increase the acceptance across patient populations and health professionals.

35343904#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study examines the quality of free vaping cessation apps,, their contents and features,, popularity among users,, and adherence to evidence-based principles.
36350700#ABSTRACT##Investors,, entrepreneurs,, health care pundits,, and venture capital firms all agree that the health care sector is awaiting a digital revolution. Steven Case,, in 2016,, predicted a "third wave" of innovation that would leverage big data,, artificial intelligence,, and machine learning to transform medicine and finally achieve reduced costs,, improved efficiency,, and better patient outcomes. Academic medical centers (AMCs) have the infrastructure and resources needed by digital health intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs to innovate,, iterate,, and optimize technology solutions for the major pain points of modern medicine. With large unique patient data sets,, strong research programs,, and subject matter experts,, AMCs have the ability to assess,, optimize,, and integrate new digital health tools with feedback at the point of care and research-based clinical validation. As AMCs begin to explore digital health solutions,, they must decide between forming internal teams to develop these innovations or collaborating with external companies. Although each has its drawbacks and benefits,, AMCs can both benefit from and drive forward the digital health innovations that will result from this journey. This viewpoint will provide an explanation as to why AMCs are ideal incubators for digital health solutions and describe what these organizations will need to be successful in leading this "third wave" of innovation.
35343904#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As the prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use,, or vaping,, continues to grow,, particularly among young people,, so does the need for research and interventions to address vaping.
35343904#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search of existing apps for vaping cessation was conducted in December 2020. Eligible apps were free,, in English,, and included features specifically targeting vaping cessation. Each app included in the analysis was used daily for at least seven consecutive days,, assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale,, and rated by at least two authors (AK,, EL,, or SS) based on adherence to evidence-based practices. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates were computed to assess interrater reliability (excellent agreement; ICC 0.92; 95% CI 0.78-0.98).
35343904#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 8 apps were included in the quality assessment and content analysis: 3 were developed specifically for vaping cessation and 5 focused on smoking cessation while also claiming to address vaping cessation. The mean of app quality total scores was 3.66 out of 5. Existing vaping cessation apps employ similar approaches to smoking cessation apps. However,, they are very low in number and have limited features developed specifically for vaping cessation.
35343904#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Given the lack of vaping cessation interventions at a time when they are urgently needed,, smartphone apps are potentially valuable tools. Therefore,, it is recommended that these apps apply evidence-based practices and undergo rigorous evaluations that can assess their quality,, contents and features,, and popularity among users. Through this process,, we can improve our understanding of how apps can be effective in helping users quit vaping.

27577372#ABSTRACT##A large number of mobile health applications (apps) are currently available with a variety of functionalities. The user ratings in the app stores seem not to be reliable to determine the quality of the apps. The traditional methods of evaluation are not suitable for fast paced nature of mobile technology. In this study,, we propose a collaborative multidimensional scale to assess the quality of mHealth apps. During our process,, the app quality is assessed in various aspects including medical reliability,, legal consistency,, ethical consistency,, usability aspects,, personal data privacy and IT security. A hypothetico-deductive approach was used in various working groups to define the audit criteria based on the various use cases that an app could provide. These criteria were then implemented into a web based self-administered questionnaires and the generation of automatic reports were considered. This method is on the one hand specific to each app because it allows to assess each health app according to its offered functionalities. On the other hand,, this method is automatic,, transferable to all apps and adapted to the dynamic nature of mobile technology.

27226391#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital health services empower people to track,, manage,, and improve their own health and quality of life while delivering a more personalized and precise health care,, at a lower cost and with higher efficiency and availability. Essential for the use of digital health services is that the treatment of any personal data is compatible with the Patient Data Act,, Personal Data Act,, and other applicable privacy laws.
27226391#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop a framework for legal challenges to support designers in development and assessment of digital health services.
27226391#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A purposive sampling,, together with snowball recruitment,, was used to identify stakeholders and information sources for organizing,, extending,, and prioritizing the different concepts,, actors,, and regulations in relation to digital health and health-promoting digital systems. The data were collected through structured interviewing and iteration,, and 3 different cases were used for face validation of the framework.
27226391#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A framework for assessing the legal challenges in developing digital health services (Legal Challenges in Digital Health [LCDH] Framework) was created and consists of 6 key questions to be used to evaluate a digital health service according to current legislation.
27226391#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Structured discussion about legal challenges in relation to health-promoting digital services can be enabled by a constructive framework to investigate,, assess,, and verify the digital service according to current legislation. The LCDH Framework developed in this study proposes such a framework and can be used in prospective evaluation of the relationship of a potential health-promoting digital service with the existing laws and regulations.

27059765#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review evaluated the efficacy and external validity of electronic (eHealth) and mobile phone (mHealth) -based interventions that promote vegetable intake in young adults.
27059765#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched several electronic databases for studies published between 1990 and 2015,, and 2 independent authors reviewed the quality and risk of bias of the eligible papers and extracted data for analyses. The primary outcome of interest was the change in vegetable intake postintervention. Where possible,, we calculated effect sizes (Cohen d and 95% CIs) for comparison. A random effects model was applied to the data for meta-analysis. Reach and representativeness of participants,, intervention implementation,, and program maintenance were assessed to establish external validity. Published validation studies were consulted to determine the validity of tools used to measure intake. We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence.
27059765#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 14 studies that met the selection criteria,, we included 12 in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis,, 7 studies found positive effects postintervention for fruit and vegetable intake,, Cohen d 0.14-0.56 (pooled effect size 0.22,, 95% CI 0.11-0.33,, I(2)=68.5%,, P=.002),, and 4 recorded positive effects on vegetable intake alone,, Cohen d 0.11-0.40 (pooled effect size 0.15,, 95% CI 0.04-0.28,, I(2)=31.4%,, P=.2). These findings should be interpreted with caution due to variability in intervention design and outcome measures. With the majority of outcomes documented as a change in combined fruit and vegetable intake,, it was difficult to determine intervention effects on vegetable consumption specifically. Measurement of intake was most commonly by self-report,, with 5 studies using nonvalidated tools. Longer-term follow-up was lacking from most studies (n=12). Risk of bias was high among the included studies,, and the overall body of evidence was rated as low quality. The applicability of interventions to the broader young adult community was unclear due to poor description of external validity components.
27059765#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Preliminary evidence suggests that eHealth and mHealth strategies may be effective in improving vegetable intake in young adults; whether these small effects have clinical or nutritional significance remains questionable. With studies predominantly reporting outcomes as fruit and vegetable intake combined,, we suggest that interventions report vegetables separately. Furthermore,, to confidently establish the efficacy of these strategies,, better-quality interventions are needed for young adults,, using valid measures of intake,, with improved reporting on costs,, sustainability and long-term effects of programs.

36444679#ABSTRACT##Evidencing eHealth interventions,, benefits generates data as a basis for assessing whether observed changes in behavior,, processes or healthcare outcomes can be attributed to the eHealth interventions. Generating such evidence requires the use of frameworks or some other type of organizing schemes to help in guiding the process and making sense of eHealth systems and the findings. The frameworks available in literature do not clearly guide on how to monitor eHealth implementation and evaluate eHealth implementation results. This study aimed to develop and validate an eHealth evaluation framework to guide the process of monitoring eHealth implementations and evaluation of eHealth results in terms of outcomes and impact on healthcare in developing countries. The Design Science Research Methodology was followed to conduct this study. Recommendations from an eHealth evaluation exploratory study in Uganda and other eHealth evaluation literature formed key inputs into the design and development of the framework. The framework consists of a generic reference model with eHealth monitoring and evaluation dimensions,, performance indicators,, and guidelines on how to conduct eHealth monitoring and evaluation. The eHealth evaluation framework received high acceptance (>80%) as regards its fitness for purpose during its validation.

17489698#ABSTRACT##The remarkable development of telemedicine applications has brought about the need for a telemedicine quality control system to prevent application failures and guarantee users. The aim of this paper was to report on the setup of a quality control system and validate it on a testing set of telemedicine products and services. The quality control system followed two main phases. Phase I was focused on data acquisition and preliminary evaluation of the telemedicine products and services. A classification form and an informative questionnaire were used to gather all the relevant information about the telemedicine application under test. Phase II was focused on evaluation and quality control of the telemedicine product. A Technical File and a Quality Assessment Checklist were used to assess the telemedicine product and service. The telemedicine quality control system was suitable for the efficient evaluation of telemedicine applications. A quality level was assigned to each product according to a threshold and an algorithm. All telemedicine products tested passed the test with a quality level higher than the threshold. The quality control system assured the definition of standardized quality levels for the telemedicine products and services. The study presented in this paper could be useful for promoting the use of standardized telemedicine applications,, and therefore speeding up their integration process in the national health service.

35627789#ABSTRACT##The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated "infodemic" have shown the importance of surveillance and promotion of health literacy,, especially for young adults such as university students who use digital media to a very high degree. This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the COVID-19 adapted version of the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI). This cross-sectional study is part of the COVID-19 University Students Survey involving 3985 students from two Italian universities. First,, item analysis and internal consistency were assessed. Then,, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) were performed comparing different models. The Italian DHLI showed good psychometric characteristics. The protecting privacy subscale was excluded,, given the criticalities presented in the validation process. CFA confirmed the four-factor structure,, also including a high-order factor. This result allows using the scale to measure a global level of digital health literacy and consider its levels separately for each construct component: searching the web for information,, evaluating reliability,, determining personal relevance,, and adding self-generated content.

30945584#ABSTRACT##Life stress is a well-established risk factor for a variety of mental and physical health problems,, including anxiety disorders,, depression,, chronic pain,, heart disease,, asthma,, autoimmune diseases,, and neurodegenerative disorders. The purpose of this article is to describe emerging approaches for assessing stress using speech,, which we do by reviewing the methodological advantages of these digital health tools,, and the validation,, ethical,, and privacy issues raised by these technologies. As we describe,, it is now possible to assess stress via the speech signal using smartphones and smart speakers that employ software programs and artificial intelligence to analyze several features of speech and speech acoustics,, including pitch,, jitter,, energy,, rate,, and length and number of pauses. Because these digital devices are ubiquitous,, we can now assess individuals' stress levels in real time in almost any natural environment in which people speak. These technologies thus have great potential for advancing digital health initiatives that involve continuously monitoring changes in psychosocial functioning and disease risk over time. However,, speech-based indices of stress have yet to be well-validated against stress biomarkers (e.g.,, cortisol,, cytokines) that predict disease risk. In addition,, acquiring speech samples raises the possibility that conversations intended to be private could one day be made public; moreover,, obtaining real-time psychosocial risk information prompts ethical questions regarding how these data should be used for medical,, commercial,, and personal purposes. Although assessing stress using speech thus has enormous potential,, there are critical validation,, privacy,, and ethical issues that must be addressed.
36300398#ABSTRACT##In this essay we will discuss capacity development in health informatics research and application,, which to us is among the major contributions of Professor John Mantas scholarship. Specifically,, driven by the inspiration of his scholarship we will elaborate on advancing new applications areas,, additional actors and geographical uptake of health informatics and eHealth solutions over time. We will illustrate capacity development in health informatics and address challenges that systematically foster digital health literacy,, engagement and empowerment,, and building health informatics capacities regionally,, in Europe and globally.

32763889#ABSTRACT##Mobile health (mHealth) and related digital health interventions in the past decade have not always scaled globally as anticipated earlier despite large investments by governments and philanthropic foundations. The implementation of digital health tools has suffered from 2 limitations: (1) the interventions commonly ignore the "law of amplification" that states that technology is most likely to succeed when it seeks to augment and not alter human behavior; and (2) end-user needs and clinical gaps are often poorly understood while designing solutions,, contributing to a substantial decrease in usage,, referred to as the "law of attrition" in eHealth. The COVID-19 pandemic has addressed the first of the 2 problems-technology solutions,, such as telemedicine,, that were struggling to find traction are now closely aligned with health-seeking behavior. The second problem (poorly designed solutions) persists,, as demonstrated by a plethora of poorly designed epidemic prediction tools and digital contact-tracing apps,, which were deployed at scale,, around the world,, with little validation. The pandemic has accelerated the Indian state's desire to build the nation's digital health ecosystem. We call for the inclusion of regulatory sandboxes,, as successfully done in the fintech sector,, to provide a real-world testing environment for mHealth solutions before deploying them at scale.

15718642#ABSTRACT##Continuous monitoring of physiological and physical parameters is necessary for the assessment and management of personal health status. It can significantly contribute to the reduction of healthcare cost by avoiding unnecessary hospitalisations and ensuring that those who need urgent care get it sooner. In conjunction with cost-effective telemedicine platforms,, ubiquitous health monitoring can significantly contribute to the enhancement of disease prevention and early diagnosis,, disease management,, treatment and home rehabilitation. Latest developments in the area of micro and nanotechnologies,, information processing and wireless communication offer,, today,, the possibility for minimally (or non) invasive biomedical measurement but also wearable sensing,, processing and data communication. Although the systems are being developed to satisfy specific user needs,, a number of common critical issues have to be tackled to achieve reliable and acceptable smart health wearable applications e.g. biomedical sensors,, user interface,, clinical validation,, data security and confidentiality,, scenarios of use,, decision support,, user acceptance and business models. Major technological achievements have been realised the last few years. Cutting edge development combining functional clothing and integrated electronics open a new research area and possibilities for body sensing and communicating health parameters. This paper reviews the current status of research and development on smart wearable health systems and applications and discusses the outstanding issues and future challenges.
32755896#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The study provides a validated survey to measure patient satisfaction and experience with telepsychiatry across 4 domains: access and timeliness,, appropriateness,, effectiveness,, and safety. Both safety and access and timeliness were found to be statistically significant predictors of satisfaction in our sample.
32755896#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#By situating patient satisfaction and experience within this framework,, the survey facilitates patient data collection and interpretation through a clinical quality lens.

36638582#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Critical reviews of the literature,, semi-structured interviews with patients,, and user stories guided the development of the content of the mobile application. These contents were refined and validated through a modified Delphi process. An expert panel of healthcare and social care professionals together with patients and academics evaluated the content through two content validity indicators,, relevance,, and adequacy,, and provided narrative feedback. The content validity of the app and each screen was determined by calculating the Content Validity Index (CVI). Similarly,, the Adequacy Index (AI) was analyzed.
36638582#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The developed app is composed by 8 topics: (1) available resources,, (2) cardiac rehabilitation,, (3) control of signs and symptoms,, (4) emotional support,, (5) learning and having fun,, (6) medication,, (7) nutrition,, and (8) physical activity. The results demonstrated high CVI of the screens and the full app. 57 of the 59 screens in the app reached an excellent CVI = 0.70 for both relevance and adequacy,, except for 2 screens. The CVI Average Method of the app was 0.851.

35612243#ABSTRACT##mHealth use for people with dementia is fraught with factors influencing its implementation in care and daily life. A better understanding of these factors may provide guidelines to inclusive design. This study aimed to assess whether factors gathered in a literature-based model could be validated by opinions of experts. On basis of a questionnaire as part of a larger study,, experts identified barriers that they considered to be related to aging and dementia influencing mHealth use. Nineteen barriers that were mentioned by the dementia experts were covered in our literature-based model. No adaptions to the model were required. The dementia experts acclaimed three barriers to mHealth use that could not be mapped onto the framework: the unavailability of (informal) caregivers to support the mHealth use,, the stage and type of dementia of an mHealth user,, and the fear of the unknown. These should be considered as prerequisites in the implementation phase of mHealth and explored more in future research.

37195515#ABSTRACT##During the last few years,, the pharmaceutical industry has adopted digital technologies/digital health technology (DHT) to improve the drug development process and the commercialization of new products. Technological advances are strongly supported by both the US-FDA and the EMA,, but the regulatory landscape in the US seems to be more suitable to promote innovation in the digital health sector (e.g. Cures Act). In contrast,, the new Medical Device Regulation sets high hurdles for Medical Device software to pass regulatory scrutiny.On both sides of the Atlantic,, a digital tool must be fit-for-purpose for the intended use in the clinical drug trial. Irrespective of its status as a Medical Device,, at least the basic safety and performance requirements according to local regulations should be met,, quality system and surveillance requirements should be fulfilled,, and the sponsor must ensure conformity with GxP and the local data privacy and cybersecurity legislations.There is an overlap in technical and clinical validation for drug development tool qualification in both regions to ensure that the digital tools deliver reliable data with tangible clinical benefits. Based on an analysis of the regulatory framework of the FDA and the EMA,, this study proposes regulatory strategies for a global pharma company: It would be prudent for drug development companies to a) use approved solutions or b) consider qualification of drug development tools early and in parallel to clinical development. Early engagement with the FDA and the EMA/CA is recommended to define evidentiary standards and corresponding regulatory pathways for different contexts-of-use and to clarify regulator's expectations as to what extent data collected by digital tools are acceptable to support marketing authorization applications (MAA).Hence a harmonization of the partly disparate regulatory requirements in the US and the EU accompanied by further development of the regulatory landscape in the EU,, could further foster the use of digital tools in drug clinical development. The outlook for the use of digital tools in clinical trials is hopeful.

34687201#ABSTRACT##Burn-injured patients must frequently travel long distances to regional burn centers,, creating a burden on families and impairing clinical outcomes. Recent federal policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic have relaxed major barriers to conducting synchronous videoconference visits in the home. However,, the efficacy and benefits of virtual visits relative to in-person visits remained unclear for burn patients. Accordingly,, a clinical quality assurance database maintained during the coronavirus pandemic (3/3/2020 to 9/8/2020) for virtual and/or in-person visits at a comprehensive adult and pediatric burn center was queried for demographics,, burn severity,, visit quality,, and distance data. A total of 143 patients were included in this study with 317 total outpatient encounters (61 virtual and 256 in-person). The savings associated with the average virtual visit were 130 ± 125 miles (mean ± standard deviation),, 164 ± 134 travel minutes,, $104 ± 99 driving costs,, and $81 ± 66 foregone wage earnings. Virtual visit technical issues were experienced by 23% of patients and were significantly lower in pediatric (5%) than in adult patients (44%; P = .006). This study is the first to assess the efficacy of synchronous videoconference visits in the home setting for outpatient burn care. The findings demonstrate major financial and temporal benefits for burn patients and their families. Technical issues remain an important barrier,, particularly for the adult population. A clear understanding of these and other barriers may inform future studies as healthcare systems and payors move toward improving access to burn care through remote healthcare delivery services.

33720031#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the increasing number of youth seeking health information on the internet,, few studies have been conducted to measure digital health literacy in this population. The digital health literacy instrument (DHLI) is defined as a scale that measures the ability to operate digital devices and read and write in web-based modes,, and it assesses seven subconstructs: operational skills,, navigation skills,, information searching,, evaluating reliability,, determining relevance,, adding self-generated content to a web-based app,, and protecting privacy. Currently,, there is no validation process of this instrument among adolescents.
33720031#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to explore the usability and content validity of DHLI.
33720031#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Upon the approval of institutional review board protocol,, cognitive interviews were conducted. A total of 34 adolescents aged 10-18 years (n=17,, 50% female) participated in individual cognitive interviews. Two rounds of concurrent cognitive interviews were conducted to assess the content validity of DHLI using the thinking aloud method and probing questions.
33720031#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Clarity related to unclear wording,, undefined technical terms,, vague terms,, and difficult vocabularies was a major issue identified. Problems related to potentially inappropriate assumptions were also identified. In addition,, concerns related to recall bias and socially sensitive phenomena were raised. No issues regarding response options or instrument instructions were noted.

29456125#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop and validate a tool for assessing dietitians' self-efficacy with using mobile health (mHealth) apps in dietetic practice.
29456125#ABSTRACT#DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS#A tool for measuring mHealth app self-efficacy among dietitians was constructed based on a literature review,, consultation with experts,, and Bandura's self-efficacy scales development guide. Senior dietetic students and new graduate dietitians in Australia (n?=?100) tested the tool.
29456125#ABSTRACT#OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS#Validation of the tool was conducted using factor analysis. Reliability testing was undertaken to examine internal consistency and repeatability.
29456125#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Construct validity was demonstrated through extraction of 4 factors with significant loadings accounting for 68% of variance: efficiency and effectiveness of nutrition care,, training and support,, integration into dietetic work systems,, and familiarity with apps. Internal consistency reliability overall was 0.90; 3 of 4 constructs had Cronbach a?>?.70. Weighted kappas for test-retest reliability indicated moderate to substantial agreement (0.43-0.76).
29456125#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS#This tool will be useful to researchers and dietetic associations interested in measuring dietitians' levels of mHealth app self-efficacy,, developing interventions to enhance self-efficacy,, and/or evaluating changes in self-efficacy after professional training. Testing of the tool in a more diverse sample of dietitians and among other health professional groups could enhance the applicability of the tool.

35107437#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The World Wide Web has become an essential source of health information. Nevertheless,, the amount and quality of information provided may lead to information overload. Therefore,, people need certain skills to search for,, identify,, and evaluate information from the internet. In the context of health information,, these competencies are summarized as the construct of eHealth literacy. Previous research has highlighted the relevance of eHealth literacy in terms of health-related outcomes. However,, the existing instrument assessing eHealth literacy in the German language reveals methodological limitations regarding test development and validation. The development and validation of a revised scale for this important construct is highly relevant.
35107437#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was the development and validation of a revised German eHealth literacy scale. In particular,, this study aimed to focus on high methodological and psychometric standards to provide a valid and reliable instrument for measuring eHealth literacy in the German language.
35107437#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two internationally validated instruments were merged to cover a wide scope of the construct of eHealth literacy and create a revised eHealth literacy scale. Translation into the German language followed scientific guidelines and recommendations to ensure content validity. Data from German-speaking people (n=470) were collected in a convenience sample from October to November 2020. Validation was performed by factor analyses. Further,, correlations were performed to examine convergent,, discriminant,, and criterion validity. Additionally,, analyses of measurement invariance of gender,, age,, and educational level were conducted.
35107437#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Following scientific guidelines for translation and test validation,, we developed a revised German eHealth Literacy Scale (GR-eHEALS). Our factor analyses confirmed an acceptable-to-good model fit. Construct validation in terms of convergent,, discriminant,, and criterion validity could mainly be confirmed. Our findings provide evidence for measurement invariance of the instrument regarding gender and educational level.

35107437#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Analyses revealed a 2-factorial model of eHealth literacy. By item-reduction,, the 2 factors information seeking and information appraisal were measured with 8 items reaching acceptable-to-good model fits (comparative fit index [CFI]: 0.942,, Tucker Lewis index [TLI]: 0.915,, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]: 0.127,, and standardized root mean square residual [SRMR]: 0.055). Convergent validity was comprehensively confirmed by significant correlations of information seeking and information appraisal with health literacy,, internet confidence,, and internet anxiety. Discriminant and criterion validity were examined by correlation analyses with various scales and could partly be confirmed. Scalar level of measurement invariance for gender (CFI: 0.932,, TLI: 0.923,, RMSEA: 0.122,, and SRMR: 0.068) and educational level (CFI: 0.937,, TLI: 0.934,, RMSEA: 0.112,, and SRMR: 0.063) were confirmed. Measurement invariance of age was rejected.

35568874#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To critically assess the quality and functionality of the available mobile apps for systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis patients.
35568874#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two reviewers independently searched the App Store and Google Play Store for eligible mobile health (mHealth) apps. Two separate searches were done: one for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the other for lupus nephritis (LN). The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to rate the quality of all selected apps.
35568874#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From the systemic lupus erythematosus screening,, our search yielded 841 apps. Within these 841 apps,, 17 of them were ultimately included. From the lupus nephritis screening,, our search returned 1152 apps. Of the 1152 apps,, 2 were ultimately included. Our search strategy included apps specifically designed for patients with SLE and LN. The MARS average of all the systemic lupus erythematosus apps was 2.7 out of 5. The MARS average of the two lupus nephritis apps was 2.6 out of 5.
35568874#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Mobile health apps can serve as an effective tool for telehealth,, engaging patients in self-care and for increasing the quality of life of lupus patients. While several mobile health technologies exist for patients with SLE and LN,, there is still a significant need for app quality improvement and expanding the comprehensiveness of offered functions.

32130183#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#With thousands of health apps in app stores globally,, it is crucial to systemically and thoroughly evaluate the quality of these apps due to their potential influence on health decisions and outcomes. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) is the only currently available tool that provides a comprehensive,, multidimensional evaluation of app quality,, which has been used to compare medical apps from American and European app stores in various areas,, available in English,, Italian,, Spanish,, and German. However,, this tool is not available in Arabic.
32130183#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to translate and adapt MARS to Arabic and validate the tool with a sample of health apps aimed at managing or preventing obesity and associated disorders.
32130183#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We followed a well-established and defined "universalist" process of cross-cultural adaptation using a mixed methods approach. Early translations of the tool,, accompanied by confirmation of the contents by two rounds of separate discussions,, were included and culminated in a final version,, which was then back-translated into English. Two trained researchers piloted the MARS in Arabic (MARS-Ar) with a sample of 10 weight management apps obtained from Google Play and the App Store. Interrater reliability was established using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). After reliability was ascertained,, the two researchers independently evaluated a set of additional 56 apps.
32130183#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#MARS-Ar was highly aligned with the original English version. The ICCs for MARS-Ar (0.836,, 95% CI 0.817-0.853) and MARS English (0.838,, 95% CI 0.819-0.855) were good. The MARS-Ar subscales were highly correlated with the original counterparts (P<.001). The lowest correlation was observed in the area of usability (r=0.685),, followed by aesthetics (r=0.827),, information quality (r=0.854),, engagement (r=0.894),, and total app quality (r=0.897). Subjective quality was also highly correlated (r=0.820).
32130183#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MARS-Ar is a valid instrument to assess app quality among trained Arabic-speaking users of health and fitness apps. Researchers and public health professionals in the Arab world can use the overall MARS score and its subscales to reliably evaluate the quality of weight management apps. Further research is necessary to test the MARS-Ar on apps addressing various health issues,, such as attention or anxiety prevention,, or sexual and reproductive health.

31441431#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mindful eating is an emerging area of research for managing unhealthy eating and weight-related behaviors such as binge eating and emotional eating. Although there are numerous commercial mindful eating apps available,, their quality,, effectiveness,, and whether they are accurately based on mindfulness-based eating awareness are unknown.
31441431#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This review aimed to appraise the quality of the mindful eating apps and to appraise the quality of content on mindful eating apps.
31441431#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A review of mindful eating apps available on Apple iTunes was undertaken from March to April 2018. Relevant apps meeting the inclusion criteria were subjectively appraised for general app quality using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) guidelines and for the quality of content on mindful eating. A total of 22 apps met the inclusion criteria and were appraised.
31441431#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Many of the reviewed apps were assessed as functional and had moderate scores in aesthetics based on the criteria in the MARS assessment. However,, some received lower scores in the domains of information and engagement. The majority of the apps did not teach users how to eat mindfully using all five senses. Hence,, they were scored as incomplete in accurately providing mindfulness-based eating awareness. Instead,, most apps were either eating timers,, hunger rating apps,, or diaries. Areas of potential improvement were in comprehensiveness and diversity of media,, in the quantity and quality of information,, and in the inclusion of privacy and security policies. To truly teach mindful eating,, the apps need to provide guided examples involving the five senses beyond simply timing eating or writing in a diary. They also need to include eating meditations to assist people with their disordered eating such as binge eating,, fullness,, satiety,, and craving meditations that may help them with coping when experiencing difficulties. They should also have engaging and entertaining features delivered through diverse media to ensure sustained use and interest by consumers.
31441431#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Future mindful eating apps could be improved by accurate adherence to mindful eating. Further improvement could be achieved by ameliorating the domains of information,, engagement,, and aesthetics and having adequate privacy policies.

33404506#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although approximately 10% of new mothers in Canada develop postpartum depression (PPD),, they face many barriers when accessing care. eHealth offers a unique opportunity to provide psychosocial skills and support to new mothers; however,, patient populations are not consistently engaged in eHealth development processes. Thus,, the diversity of women's backgrounds and needs are often not reflected in existing tools.
33404506#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to engage women from a variety of backgrounds and locations around British Columbia (BC) who have previously experienced PPD to determine the unmet psychoeducational needs of women with PPD and how a web-enabled platform used to deliver psychosocial skills and education to assist in the management of PPD could fulfill those needs.
33404506#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Focus groups were conducted in 7 cities across BC with a total of 31 women (mean age 34.5 years,, SD 4.9),, with each group ranging from 2-7 participants. Focus groups were cofacilitated by the study coordinator and a local service provider in each community using a semistructured guide to discuss participants' needs,, ideas,, and opinions as they relate to the use of technology in PPD management. Transcripts were approached inductively using thematic analysis to identify themes and qualitative description to frame what was observed in the data.
33404506#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 5 themes were identified: bridging gaps to meet needs; providing validation to combat stigma; nurturing capacity to cope,, manage,, and/or reach wellness; empowering people to take ownership over their mental health; and offering customization to ensure relevance. Each theme identified a need (eg,, combatting stigma) and a way to address that need using a web-enabled intervention (eg,, providing validation). At the intersection of these themes was the overarching value of promoting agency for women experiencing PPD.
33404506#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Ultimately,, new mothers require accessible mental health care that promotes their agency in mental health care decision making. Our participants believed that a web-enabled intervention could help meet this need. These data will be used to guide the design of such an intervention,, with the eventual implementation of this resource as a first-line management option for PPD.

36360756#ABSTRACT##Science and technology have evolved quickly during the two decades of the 21st century,, but healthcare systems are grounded in last century's structure and processes. Changes in the way health care is provided are demanded; digital transformation is a key driver making healthcare systems more accessible,, agile,, efficient,, and citizen-centered. Nevertheless,, the way healthcare systems function challenges the development (Innovation + Development and regulatory requirements),, assessment (methodological guidance weaknesses),, and adoption of digital applications (DAs). WtsWrng (WW),, an innovative DA which uses images to interact with citizens for symptom triage and monitoring,, is used as an example to show the challenges faced in its development and clinical validation and how these are being overcome. To prove WW's value from inception,, novel approaches for evidence generation that allows for an agile and patient-centered development have been applied. Early scientific advice from NICE (UK) was sought for study design,, an iterative development and interim analysis was performed,, and different statistical parameters (Kappa,, B statistic) were explored to face development and assessment challenges. WW triage accuracy at cutoff time ranged from 0.62 to 0.94 for the most frequent symptoms attending the Emergency Department (ED),, with the observed concordance for the 12 most frequent diagnostics at hospital discharge fluctuating between 0.4 to 0.97; 8 of the diagnostics had a concordance greater than 0.8. This experience should provoke reflective thinking for DA developers,, digital health scientists,, regulators,, health technology assessors,, and payers.

34550089#ABSTRACT##Despite recent and potent technological advances,, the real-world implementation of remote digital health technology in the care and monitoring of patients with motor neuron disease has not yet been realized. Digital health technology may increase the accessibility to and personalization of care,, whereas remote biosensors could optimize the collection of vital clinical parameters,, irrespective of patients' ability to visit the clinic. To facilitate the wide-scale adoption of digital health care technology and to align current initiatives,, we outline a road map that will identify clinically relevant digital parameters; mediate the development of benefit-to-burden criteria for innovative technology; and direct the validation,, harmonization,, and adoption of digital health care technology in real-world settings. We define two key end products of the road map: (1) a set of reliable digital parameters to capture data collected under free-living conditions that reflect patient-centric measures and facilitate clinical decision making and (2) an integrated,, open-source system that provides personalized feedback to patients,, health care providers,, clinical researchers,, and caregivers and is linked to a flexible and adaptable platform that integrates patient data in real time. Given the ever-changing care needs of patients and the relentless progression rate of motor neuron disease,, the adoption of digital health care technology will significantly benefit the delivery of care and accelerate the development of effective treatments.

29936593#ABSTRACT##The burden on healthcare services in the world has increased substantially in the past decades. The quality and quantity of care have to increase to meet surging demands,, especially among patients with chronic heart diseases. The expansion of information and communication technologies has led to new models for the delivery healthcare services in telemedicine. Therefore,, mHealth plays an imperative role in the sustainable delivery of healthcare services in telemedicine. This paper presents a comprehensive review of healthcare service provision. It highlights the open issues and challenges related to the use of the real-time fault-tolerant mHealth system in telemedicine. The methodological aspects of mHealth are examined,, and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first discusses the identification process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of 'time of arrival of patient at the hospital/multi-services' and 'hospitals' within mHealth. The second phase discusses the development of a decision matrix for hospital selection based on the MAHP method. The third phase discusses the validation of the proposed system.

33213184#ABSTRACT##Objective: The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the quality of patient-oriented,, mobile health applications (apps) available for medical management of kidney stone disease (KSD). Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify apps from the Apple and Google Play app stores. Eligible apps were divided into two categories: (1) fluid apps and (2) dietary apps. Descriptive characteristics were summarized and app quality was independently evaluated on the basis of technical quality,, usability,, clinical value,, and privacy/security. The validated Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was the backbone for the evaluation framework. Results: In total,, 31 apps (18 fluid apps and 13 dietary apps) were included. Fluid apps outscore dietary apps in all dimensions of MARS quality. All but one fluid app exceeded the minimum acceptable MARS score of 3.0 vs 46% of dietary management apps. Dietary apps feature less functionality and most are limited to noninteractive informational content. While most data-capturing apps provide a privacy policy and ensure that security measures are taken to protect user identity,, only 36% offer users choice or consent for secondary use of their data after data have already been collected. Overall,, only one app has undergone any form of real-world clinical investigation. Conclusions: Fluid management apps outperform dietary apps in technical quality,, usability,, and clinical value at the cost of greater privacy/security risks. Despite not being targeted to patients with KSD,, they are higher in most quality measures and offer greater functionality to support long-term disease management compared with dietary apps.
22226255#ABSTRACT##The design and implementation of telemedicine systems able to support the artificial pancreas need careful choices to cope with technological requirements while preserving performance and decision support capabilities. This article addresses the issue of designing a general architecture for the telemedicine components of an artificial pancreas and illustrates a viable solution that is able to deal with different use cases and is amenable to support mobile-health implementations. The goal is to enforce interoperability among the components of the architecture and guarantee maximum flexibility for the ensuing implementations. Thus,, the design stresses modularity and separation of concerns along with adoption of clearly defined protocols for interconnecting the necessary components. This accounts for the implementation of integrated telemedicine systems suitable as short-term monitoring devices for supporting validation of closed-loop algorithms as well as devices meant to provide a lifelong tighter control on the patient state once the artificial pancreas has become the preferred treatment for patients with diabetes.

35788102#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In 2020,, more than 250 eHealth solutions were added to app stores each day,, or 90,,000 in the year; however,, the vast majority of these solutions have not undergone clinical validation,, their quality is unknown,, and the user does not know if they are effective and safe. We sought to develop a simple prescreening scoring method that would assess the quality and clinical relevance of each app. We designed this tool with 3 health care stakeholder groups in mind: eHealth solution designers seeking to evaluate a potential competitor or their own tool,, investors considering a fundraising candidate,, and a hospital clinician or IT department wishing to evaluate a current or potential eHealth solution.
35788102#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We built and tested a novel prescreening scoring tool (the Medical Digital Solution scoring tool). The tool,, which consists of 26 questions that enable the quick assessment and comparison of the clinical relevance and quality of eHealth apps,, was tested on 68 eHealth solutions.
35788102#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Medical Digital Solution scoring tool is based on the 2021 evaluation criteria of the French National Health Authority,, the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology recommendations,, and other provided scores. We built the scoring tool with patient association and eHealth experts and submitted it to eHealth app creators,, who evaluated their apps via the web-based form in January 2022. After completing the evaluation criteria,, their apps obtained an overall score and 4 categories of subscores. These criteria evaluated the type of solution and domain,, the solution's targeted population size,, the level of clinical assessment,, and information about the provider.
35788102#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 68 eHealth solutions were evaluated with the scoring tool. Oncology apps (22%,, 20/90) and general health solutions (23%,, 21/90) were the most represented. Of the 68 apps,, 32 (47%) were involved in remote monitoring by health professionals. Regarding clinical outcomes,, 5% (9/169) of the apps assessed overall survival. Randomized studies had been conducted for 21% (23/110) of the apps to assess their benefit. Of the 68 providers,, 38 (56%) declared the objective of obtaining reimbursement,, and 7 (18%) out of the 38 solutions seeking reimbursement were assessed as having a high probability of reimbursement. The median global score was 11.2 (range 4.7-17.4) out of 20 and the distribution of the scores followed a normal distribution pattern (Shapiro-Wilk test: P=.33).
35788102#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This multidomain prescreening scoring tool is simple,, fast,, and can be deployed on a large scale to initiate an assessment of the clinical relevance and quality of a clinical eHealth app. This simple tool can help a decision-maker determine which aspects of the app require further analysis and improvement.

32012066#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parameterization of pediatric growth charts allows precise quantitation of growth metrics that would be difficult or impossible with traditional paper charts. However,, limited availability of growth chart calculators for use by clinicians and clinical researchers currently restricts broader application.
32012066#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to assess the deployment of electronic calculators for growth charts using the lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) parameterization method,, with examples of their utilization for patient care delivery,, clinical research,, and quality improvement projects.
32012066#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The publicly accessible PediTools website of clinical calculators was developed to allow LMS-based calculations on anthropometric measurements of individual patients. Similar calculations were applied in a retrospective study of a population of patients from 7 Massachusetts neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to compare interhospital growth outcomes (change in weight Z-score from birth to discharge [?Z weight]) and their association with gestational age at birth. At 1 hospital,, a bundle of quality improvement interventions targeting improved growth was implemented,, and the outcomes were assessed prospectively via monitoring of ?Z weight pre- and postintervention.
32012066#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The PediTools website was launched in January 2012,, and as of June 2019,, it received over 500,,000 page views per month,, with users from over 21 countries. A retrospective analysis of 7975 patients at 7 Massachusetts NICUs,, born between 2006 and 2011,, at 23 to 34 completed weeks gestation identified an overall ?Z weight from birth to discharge of -0.81 (P<.001). However,, the degree of ?Z weight differed significantly by hospital,, ranging from -0.56 to -1.05 (P<.001). Also identified was the association between inferior growth outcomes and lower gestational age at birth,, as well as that the degree of association between ?Z weight and gestation at birth also differed by hospital. At 1 hospital,, implementing a bundle of interventions targeting growth resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in loss of weight Z-score from birth to discharge.
32012066#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#LMS-based anthropometric measurement calculation tools on a public website have been widely utilized. Application in a retrospective clinical study on a large dataset demonstrated inferior growth at lower gestational age and interhospital variation in growth outcomes. Change in weight Z-score has potential utility as an outcome measure for monitoring clinical quality improvement. We also announce the release of open-source computer code written in R to allow other clinicians and clinical researchers to easily perform similar analyses.

34786974#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health apps have the potential to promote adherence to headache management through the use of evidence-based behavior change techniques (e.g.,, self-monitoring). While many headache management apps exist,, the extent to which these apps include behavior change techniques remains unknown. Thus,, the present study systematically evaluated the content and quality of commercially available headache management apps.
34786974#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Headache apps were identified using a systematic search in the Apple App and Google Play stores. A total of 55 apps were evaluated using the taxonomy of behavior change techniques and app quality using the Mobile App Rating Scale.
34786974#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Headache management apps included 0-14 behavior change techniques (Mean [M] = 5.89) and 0-8 headache management behavior change techniques (M?=?4.29). App quality ranged from 2.84-4.67 (M?=?3.73) out of 5.00. Three apps,, Migraine Trainer,, Easeday: Headache & Migraine,, and PainScale,, included the highest number of overall and headache management behavior change techniques along with good quality scores.
34786974#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#While randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine the efficacy of individual headache apps,, most existing apps include evidence-based headache management behavior change techniques. Headache apps often focus on either self-monitoring or stress management via relaxation training,, suggesting that patients' needs should be used to inform app selection.

37037124#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The questionnaire was translated by one high English proficiency translator and was back translated. The items of the questionnaire were modified for Spanish readers and for breastfeeding users. The modified questionnaire was assessed for content validity with a panel of 5 experts and 12 users and the modified kappa statistic was used to determine the interrater agreement among the raters. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed in a mobile application for breastfeeding support (LactApp) by 202 users. The structure of the questionnaire was validated using exploratory factor analysis.
37037124#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#All items of the questionnaire were relevant,, clear or comprehensible with content validity index values higher than 0.79. The modified kappa agreement for each item of the modified MAUQ (m-MAUQ) proved an excellent agreement (? = 0.9-1.0). Factor analysis of the m-MAUQ showed four subscales. The internal consistency of the complete questionnaire was high (Cronbach a = 0.89).
37037124#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Spanish and modified MAUQ demonstrated high reliability and validity and it might be used to evaluate the usability,, utility and acceptability of mHealth apps aiming to support lactating women.

34259639#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There is a robust market for mobile health (mHealth) apps focused on self-guided interventions to address a high prevalence of mental health disorders and behavioral health needs in the general population. Disseminating mental health interventions via mHealth technologies may help overcome barriers in access to care and has broad consumer appeal. However,, development and testing of mental health apps in formal research settings are limited and far outpaced by everyday consumer use. In addition to prioritizing efficacy and effectiveness testing,, researchers should examine and test app design elements that impact the user experience,, increase engagement,, and lead to sustained use over time.
34259639#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to evaluate the objective and subjective quality of apps that are successful across both research and consumer sectors,, and the relationships between objective app quality,, subjective user ratings,, and evidence-based behavior change techniques. This will help inform user-centered design considerations for mHealth researchers to maximize design elements and features associated with consumer appeal,, engagement,, and sustainability.

34259639#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a user-centered design analysis of popular consumer apps with scientific backing utilizing the well-validated Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Popular consumer apps with research support were identified via a systematic search of the App Store iOS (Apple Inc) and Google Play (Google LLC) and literature review. We evaluated the quality metrics of 19 mental health apps along 4 MARS subscales,, namely,, Engagement,, Functionality,, Aesthetics,, and Information Quality. MARS total and subscale scores range from 1 to 5,, with higher scores representing better quality. We then extracted user ratings from app download platforms and coded apps for evidence-based treatment components. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to identify associations between MARS scores,, App Store iOS/Google Play consumer ratings,, and number of evidence-based treatment components.
34259639#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The mean MARS score was 3.52 (SD 0.71),, consumer rating was 4.22 (SD 0.54),, and number of evidence-based treatment components was 2.32 (SD 1.42). Consumer ratings were significantly correlated with the MARS Functionality subscale (r=0.74,, P<.001),, Aesthetics subscale (r=0.70,, P<.01),, and total score (r=0.58,, P=.01). Number of evidence-based intervention components was not associated with MARS scores (r=0.085,, P=.73) or consumer ratings (r=-0.329,, P=.16).
34259639#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In our analysis of popular research-supported consumer apps,, objective app quality and subjective consumer ratings were generally high. App functionality and aesthetics were highly consistent with consumer appeal,, whereas evidence-based components were not. In addition to designing treatments that work,, we recommend that researchers prioritize aspects of app design that impact the user experience for engagement and sustainability (eg,, ease of use,, navigation,, visual appeal). This will help translate evidence-based interventions to the competitive consumer app market,, thus bridging the gap between research development and real-world implementation.

20495992#ABSTRACT#UNLABELLED#There is a need to make medical diagnosis available to critically ill patients on-site,, without the necessity of time-consuming and risky transportation to larger reference hospitals. The teleconsultation of medical images is possible with the use of Internet-based TeleDICOM software developed in Krakow,, Poland. Interactive consultation between two or more centers offers real-time voice communication,, visualization of synchronized Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine images,, and use of interactive pointers and specific calculation tools. If direct interaction between physicians is not needed,, the system can also be used in "offline" mode. In 2006,, TeleDICOM was successfully deployed in the John Paul II Hospital in Krakow as well as a dozen other cooperating medical centers throughout southeast Poland. It is used for routine referral for cardiosurgical procedures. Aims of the study were to evaluate the image quality,, software stability,, constant availability,, data transmission speed,, and quality of real-time synchronized viewing of the images during the TeleDICOM teleconsultation; to evaluate the clinical utility of the TeleDICOM system; and to analyze the compatibility of TeleDICOM with the storage data formats of various imaging machine manufacturers. The analysis of angiographic offline teleconsultations was based on 918 patients referred remotely for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The echocardiographic teleconsultations were performed during 63 live interactive consultations,, several of them were presented to live during medical conferences. Measurement tools of the TeleDICOM software were tested against original measurement tools of echocardiographic machines from four different manufacturers. As a result of TeleDICOM consultation,, a CABG decision was made in 806 of 918 patients consulted (87.8%). In remaining 12 patients,, medical therapy or percutaneous angioplasty was recommended. CABG was performed in 98.6% of the admitted patients. Treatment decisions were changed after admission in 1.4% of patients-however,, in all cases,, it was not related to analysis of angiography data but rather to the change of clinical condition of the patients. All medical personnel involved in both offline and interactive teleconsultations judged the system positively in all assessed aspects. Lesser scores were observed only in the centers connected by slower networks. Measurements performed in the ECHO-TeleDICOM module were accurate as compared with those performed on a standard echo-machine (correlation r > 0.980,, p < 0.001),, independently of the echocardiograph model.

22870558#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic health records (EHRs) hold the promise of improving clinical quality and population health while reducing health care costs. However,, it is not clear how these goals can be achieved in practice.
22870558#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Clinician-led teams developed EHR data extracts to support chronic disease use cases. EHRs were linked with community-level data to describe disease prevalence and health care quality at the patient,, health care system,, and community risk factor levels. Software was developed and statistical modeling included multivariate,, mixed-model,, longitudinal,, data mining,, and geographic information system (GIS)/spatial regression approaches.

22870558#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A HIPAA-compliant limited data set was created on 192,,201 patients seen in University of Wisconsin Family Medicine clinics throughout Wisconsin in 2007-2009. It was linked to a commercially available database of approximately 6000 variables describing community-level risk factors at the census block group. Areas of increased asthma and diabetes prevalence have been mapped,, identified,, and compared to economic hardship.
22870558#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A comprehensive framework has been developed for clinical-public health data exchange to develop new evidence and apply it to clinical practice and health policy. EHR data at the neighborhood level can be used for future population studies and may enhance understanding of community-level patterns of illness and care.

36862494#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the importance of the privacy and confidentiality of patients' information,, mobile health (mHealth) apps can raise the risk of violating users' privacy and confidentiality. Research has shown that many apps provide an insecure infrastructure and that security is not a priority for developers.
36862494#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive tool to be considered by developers for assessing the security and privacy of mHealth apps.
36862494#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A literature search was performed to identify papers on app development,, and those papers reporting criteria for the security and privacy of mHealth were assessed. The criteria were extracted using content analysis and presented to experts. An expert panel was held for determining the categories and subcategories of the criteria according to meaning,, repetition,, and overlap; impact scores were also measured. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used for validating the criteria. The validity and reliability of the instrument were calculated to present an assessment instrument.
36862494#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed comprehensive criteria can be used as a guide for app designers,, developers,, and even researchers. The criteria and the countermeasures presented in this study can be considered to improve the privacy and security of mHealth apps before releasing the apps into the market. Regulators are recommended to consider an established standard using such criteria for the accreditation process,, since the available self-certification of developers is not reliable enough.

32553443#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to review our experience in the implementation of an innovative Telemedicine Platform (the Teleburns Project) for the acute care of burned patients.
32553443#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed and implemented a Teleburns Platform by the creation of a new medical software and hardware for High Definition medical videoconference,, in order to assist distant burned patients. After the establishment of the system and revision of technical requirements,, an internal validation of the project was done: we managed 40 consecutive burned patients via telemedicine videoconference within our own Center. Following the internal validation,, a pilot test with the Verge de la Cinta Hospital (VCH) - located in Tortosa,, 180km away from Barcelona - was conducted. A prospective review of 43 burn patients participating in tele-encounters was performed. The data collected were: patient and injury demographics,, need for transfer to our hospital,, need for surgical treatment,, complications,, readmissions and technical problems.

32553443#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#No discrepancies were found between remote and face-to-face diagnosis and treatment during internal validation,, obtaining a 100% reliability. No technical errors were reported. Concerning the pilot test with the VCH,, 43 patients were assessed via telemedicine during a 48-month period. Mean age of the participants was 36.7 (0-85 years). The mean total burn surface area was 3.1% (range 0.5-15%). The more frequently affected areas were head and neck (27 patients) and hands (16 patients). As a result of the 43 televisits,, 8 patients (18.6%) were immediately transferred to our Burn Center in Barcelona and 12 patients (27.9%) were asked to come a few days later,, to be visited in our Day Care Unit. Thus 23 patients (53.5%) could avoid being transferred to the Burn Center. 5 of them were followed via Teleburns without complications and 17 patients were discharged after the first tele-encounter. All patients discharged presented an uneventful evolution and did not receive further care from our Burn Unit. Technical problems were reported in eleven occasions during this phase,, none of which prevented completion of the visits.
32553443#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The use of Telemedicine for burn assessment can improve the accuracy of burn patients triage,, resulting in enhanced resource utilization,, time and cost saving for the health system and increased quality of care.

35329126#ABSTRACT##Digital health literacy is crucial in accessing and applying health information in the COVID-19 pandemic period. Young college students are exposed daily to digital technologies,, and they have further increased the use of digital information during the COVID-19 period. This study aimed to adapt DHLI into Korean and to assess the psychometric properties,, during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A cross-sectional,, nationwide,, and web-based survey was conducted among 604 Korean undergraduates from 23 December 2020 to 8 January 2021. On the basis of the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI) by the Global COVID HL Network,, the Korean questionnaire was developed by group translation,, expert reviews,, and forward-backward translation for validation. The scale reliability and validity were examined using Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis. Results support the theoretical and empirical four-factor structure (search,, express,, evaluate,, use) in the coronavirus-related DHL among Korean University students. Internal reliability of the overall scale was high (Cronbach's a = 0.908). The four-factor model was supported by confirmatory factor analysis (GFI = 0.972,, CFI = 0.984,, TLI = 0.978,, RMSEA = 0.045). This study revealed that the COVID-DHL-K is a valid and reliable measure with appropriate psychometric characteristics.

37043268#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#With the increasing digitalization in health care,, an effective instrument is necessary to assess health care consumers' digital competencies-their "eHealth literacy." The 7-scale eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ),, based on the theoretically robust eHealth Literacy Framework,, has shown strong psychometric properties in Denmark and Australia.
37043268#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to translate,, culturally adapt,, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the eHLQ.
37043268#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We followed the Translation Integrity Procedure guidelines to translate and culturally adapt the questionnaire to Swedish using forward and backward translations,, review by an expert panel,, and cognitive interviewing. The psychometric properties of the Swedish eHLQ were investigated by evaluating its internal consistency (Cronbach a) and a priori-defined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis).
37043268#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 236 primary health care patients and parents of hospitalized children were included in the validation analysis. The mean age was 48.5 years,, and 129 (55%) were women. All 7 eHLQ scales showed good internal consistency,, with the Cronbach a ranging from .82 to .92. Single-factor and 7-factor confirmatory factor analysis showed satisfactory model-fit values. With one exception,, all items demonstrated satisfactory loadings on their respective factors.
37043268#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Swedish eHLQ demonstrated strong psychometric properties. It has the potential as a useful tool for a variety of purposes,, including population surveys,, intervention evaluations,, and eHealth service implementations.

33315580#ABSTRACT##Recently,, companies such as Apple Inc,, Fitbit Inc,, and Garmin Ltd have released new wearable blood oxygenation measurement technologies. Although the release of these technologies has great potential for generating health-related information,, it is important to acknowledge the repercussions of consumer-targeted biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs),, which in practice,, are often used for medical decision making. BioMeTs are bodily connected digital medicine products that process data captured by mobile sensors that use algorithms to generate measures of behavioral and physiological function. These BioMeTs span both general wellness products and medical devices,, and consumer-targeted BioMeTs intended for general wellness purposes are not required to undergo a standardized and transparent evaluation process for ensuring their quality and accuracy. The combination of product functionality,, marketing,, and the circumstances of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have inevitably led to the use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs for reporting health-related measurements to drive medical decision making. In this viewpoint,, we urge consumer-targeted BioMeT manufacturers to go beyond the bare minimum requirements described in US Food and Drug Administration guidance when releasing information on wellness BioMeTs. We also explore new methods and incentive systems that may result in a clearer public understanding of the performance and intended use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs.

33320742#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To report the clinical validation of an innovative,, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered,, portable and non-invasive medical device called Wound Viewer. The AI medical device uses dedicated sensors and AI algorithms to remotely collect objective and precise clinical data,, including three-dimensional (3D) wound measurements,, tissue composition and wound classification through the internationally recognised Wound Bed Preparation (WBP) protocol; this data can then be shared through a secure General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)- and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data transfer system. This trial aims to test the reliability and precision of the AI medical device and its ability to aid health professionals in clinically evaluating wounds as efficiently remotely as at the bedside.
33320742#ABSTRACT#METHOD#This non-randomised comparative clinical trial was conducted in the Clinica San Luca (Turin,, Italy). Patients were divided into three groups: (i) patients with venous and arterial ulcers in the lower limbs; (ii) patients with diabetes and presenting with diabetic foot syndrome; and (iii) patients with pressure ulcers. Each wound was evaluated for area,, depth,, volume and WBP wound classification. Each patient was examined once and the results,, analysed by the AI medical device,, were compared against data obtained following visual evaluation by the physician and research team. The area and depth were compared with a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variations in the obtained distribution (expected p-value>0.1 for both tests). The WBP classification and tissue segmentation were analysed by directly comparing the classification obtained by the AI medical device against that of the testing physician.
33320742#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 150 patients took part in the trial. The results demonstrated that the AI medical device's AI algorithm could acquire objective clinical parameters in a completely automated manner. The AI medical device reached 97% accuracy against the WBP classification and tissue segmentation analysis compared with that performed in person by the physician. Moreover,, data regarding the measurements of the wounds,, as analysed through the Kruskal-Wallis technique,, showed that the data distribution proved comparable with the other methods of measurement previously clinically validated in the literature (p=0.9).
33320742#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#These findings indicate that remote wound assessment undertaken by physicians is as effective through the AI medical device as bedside examination,, and that the device was able to assess wounds and provide a precise WBP wound classification. Furthermore,, there was no need for manual data entry,, thereby reducing the risk of human error while preserving high-quality clinical diagnostic data.

27387434#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A growing body of literature affirms the usefulness of mobile technologies,, including mobile applications (apps),, in the primary prevention field. The quality of health apps,, which today number in the thousands,, is a crucial parameter,, as it may affect health-related decision-making and outcomes among app end-users. The mobile application rating scale (MARS) has recently been developed to evaluate the quality of such apps,, and has shown good psychometric properties. Since there is no standardised tool for assessing the apps available in Italian app stores,, the present study developed and validated an Italian version of MARS in apps targeting primary prevention.
27387434#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original 23-item version of the MARS assesses mobile app quality in four objective quality dimensions (engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, information) and one subjective dimension. Validation of this tool involved several steps; the universalist approach to achieving equivalence was adopted. Following two backward translations,, a reconciled Italian version of MARS was produced and compared with the original scale. On the basis of sample size estimation,, 48 apps from three major app stores were downloaded; the first 5 were used for piloting,, while the remaining 43 were used in the main study in order to assess the psychometric properties of the scale. The apps were assessed by two raters,, each working independently. The psychometric properties of the final version of the scale was assessed including the inter-rater reliability,, internal consistency,, convergent,, divergent and concurrent validities.
27387434#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The intralingual equivalence of the Italian version of the MARS was confirmed by the authors of the original scale. A total of 43 apps targeting primary prevention were tested. The MARS displayed acceptable psychometric properties. The MARS total score showed an excellent level of both inter-rater agreement (intra-class correlation coefficient of .96) and internal consistency (Cronbach's a of .90 and .91 for the two raters,, respectively). Other types of validity,, including convergent,, divergent,, discriminative,, known-groups and scalability,, were also established.
27387434#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Italian version of MARS is a valid and reliable tool for assessing the health-related primary prevention apps available in Italian app stores.

32130169#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In recent years,, the considerable increase in the number of mobile health (mHealth) apps has made health care more accessible and affordable for all. However,, the exponential growth in mHealth solutions has occurred with almost no control or regulation of any kind. Despite some recent initiatives,, there is still no specific regulation procedure,, accreditation system,, or standards to help the development of the apps,, mitigate risks,, or guarantee quality.
32130169#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The main aim of this study was to propose a set of criteria for mHealth-related apps on the basis of what is available from published studies,, guidelines,, and standards in the various areas that are related to health app development.
32130169#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used three sources of information to identify the most important criteria. First,, we conducted a systematic review of all the studies published on pain-related apps. Second,, we searched for health app recommendations on the websites of professional organizations. Third,, we looked for standards governing the development of software for medical devices on the specialized websites of regulatory organizations. Then,, we grouped and subsumed the criteria we had identified on the basis of their shared characteristics. Finally,, the comprehensibility and perceived importance of the resulting criteria were evaluated for face validity with a group of 18 stakeholders.
32130169#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified a total of 503 criteria from all sources,, which,, after close analysis,, were grouped into eight different categories,, including 36 important criteria for health apps. The resulting categories were usability,, privacy,, security,, appropriateness and suitability,, transparency and content,, safety,, technical support and updates,, and technology. The results of the preliminary analysis showed that the criteria were mostly understood by the group of stakeholders. In addition,, they perceived all of them as important.
32130169#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This set of criteria can help health care providers,, developers,, patients,, and other stakeholders to guide the development of mHealth-related apps and,, potentially,, to measure the quality of an mHealth app.

34860681#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The ubiquity of smartphones and mobile devices in the general population presents an unprecedented opportunity for preventative health. Not surprisingly,, the use of electronic health (eHealth) resources accessed through mobile devices in clinical trials is becoming more prevalent; the selection,, screening,, and collation of quality eHealth resources is necessary to clinical trials using these technologies. However,, the constant creation and turnover of new eHealth resources can make this task difficult. Although syntheses of eHealth resources are becoming more common,, their methodological and reporting quality require improvement so as to be more accessible to nonexperts. Further,, there continues to be significant variation in quality criteria employed for assessment,, with no clear method for developing the included criteria. There is currently no single existing framework that addresses all six dimensions of mobile health app quality identified in Agarwal et al's recent scoping review (ie,, basic descriptions of the design and usage of the resource; technical features and accessibility; health information quality; usability; evidence of impact; and user engagement and behavior change). In instances where highly systematic tactics are not possible (due to time constraints,, cost,, or lack of expertise),, there may be value in adopting practical and pragmatic approaches to helping researchers and clinicians identify and disseminate e-resources.
34860681#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The study aimed to create a set of guidelines (ie,, a checklist) to aid the members of the Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI) Canada trial-a preconception randomized controlled clinical trial to prevent child obesity-to assist their efforts in searching,, identifying,, screening,, and including selected eHealth resources for participant use in the study intervention.
34860681#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A framework for searching,, screening,, and selecting eHealth resources was adapted from the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist for systematic and scoping reviews to optimize the rigor,, clarity,, and transparency of the process. Details regarding searching,, selecting,, extracting,, and assessing quality of eHealth resources are described.
34860681#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This study resulted in the systematic development of a checklist consisting of 12 guiding principles,, organized in a chronological versus priority sequence to aid researchers in searching,, screening,, and assessing the quality of various eHealth resources.

34860681#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The eHealth Resource Checklist will assist researchers in navigating the eHealth resource space by providing a mechanism to detail their process of developing inclusion criteria,, identifying search location,, selecting and reviewing evidence,, extracting information,, evaluating the quality of the evidence,, and synthesizing the extracted evidence. The overarching goal of this checklist is to provide researchers or generalists new to the eHealth field with a tool that balances pragmatism with rigor and that helps standardize the process of searching and critiquing digital material-a particularly important aspect given the recent explosion of and reliance on eHealth resources. Moreover,, this checklist may be useful to other researchers and practitioners developing similar health interventions.
35049508#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to design a mobile health app,, Prevent Connect,, and to assess its quality for (1) assessing patient behavior for 4 cardiovascular risk factors (unhealthy eating,, sedentary lifestyle,, alcohol,, and tobacco consumption) and (2) suggesting personalized recommendations and mobile health interventions for risky behaviors.
35049508#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The knowledge base of the app is based on French national recommendations for healthy eating,, physical activity,, and limiting alcohol and tobacco consumption. It contains a list of patient behaviors and related personalized recommendations and digital health interventions. The interface was designed according to usability principles. Its quality was assessed by a panel of 52 users in a 5-step process: completion of the demographic form,, visualization of a short presentation of the app,, testing of the app,, completion of the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS),, and an open group discussion.
35049508#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This app assesses patient behaviors through specific questionnaires about 4 risk factors (unhealthy eating,, sedentary lifestyle,, alcohol,, and tobacco consumption) and suggests personalized recommendations and digital health interventions for improving behavior. The app was deemed to be of good quality,, with a mean uMARS quality score of 4 on a 5-point Likert scale. The functionality and information content of the app were particularly appreciated,, with a mean uMARS score above 4. Almost all the study participants appreciated the navigation system and found the app easy to use. More than three-quarters of the study participants found the app content relevant,, concise,, and comprehensive. The aesthetics and the engagement of the app were also appreciated (uMARS score,, 3.7). Overall,, 80% (42/52) of the study participants declared that the app helped them to become aware of the importance of addressing health behavior,, and 65% (34/52) said that the app helped motivate them to change lifestyle habits.
35049508#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The app assessed the risky behaviors of the patients and delivered personalized recommendations and digital health interventions for multiple risk factors. The quality of the app was considered to be good,, but the impact of the app on behavior changes is yet to be demonstrated and will be assessed in further studies.

35014965#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health apps are often used without adequately taking aspects related to their quality under consideration. This may partially be due to inadequate awareness about necessary criteria and how to prioritize them when evaluating an app.
35014965#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to introduce a method for prioritizing quality attributes in the mobile health context. To this end,, physicians were asked about their assessment of nine app quality principles relevant in health contexts and their responses were used as a basis for designing a method for app prioritization. Ultimately,, the goal was to aid in making better use of limited resources (eg,, time) by assisting with the decision as to the specific quality principles that deserve priority in everyday medical practice and those that can be given lower priority,, even in cases where the overall principles are rated similarly.
35014965#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 9503 members of two German professional societies in the field of orthopedics were invited by email to participate in an anonymous online survey over a 1-month period. Participants were asked to rate a set of nine app quality principles using a Kano survey with functional and dysfunctional (ie,, positively and negatively worded) questions. The evaluation was based on the work of Kano (baseline),, supplemented by a self-designed approach.
35014965#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Among the 9503 invited members,, 382 completed relevant parts of the survey (return rate of 4.02%). These participants were equally and randomly assigned to two groups (test group and validation group,, n=191 each). Demographic characteristics did not significantly differ between groups (all P>.05). Participants were predominantly male (328/382,, 85.9%) and older than 40 years (290/382,, 75.9%). Given similar ratings,, common evaluation strategies for Kano surveys did not allow for conclusive prioritization of the principles,, and the same was true when using the more elaborate approach of satisfaction and dissatisfaction indices following the work of Timko. Therefore,, an extended,, so-called "in-line-of-sight" method was developed and applied for this evaluation. Modified from the Timko method,, this approach is based on a "point of view" (POV) metric,, which generates a ranking coefficient. Although the principles were previously almost exclusively rated as must-be (with the exception of resource efficiency),, which was not conducive to their prioritization,, the new method applied from the must-be POV resulted in identical rankings for the test and validation groups: (1) legal conformity,, (2) content validity,, (3) risk adequacy,, (4) practicality,, (5) ethical soundness,, (6) usability,, (7) transparency,, (8) technical adequacy,, and (9) resource efficiency.
35014965#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Established survey methodologies based on the work of Kano predominantly seek to categorize the attributes to be evaluated. The methodology presented here is an interesting option for prioritization,, and enables focusing on the most important criteria,, thus saving valuable time when reviewing apps for use in the medical field,, even with otherwise largely similar categorization results. The extent to which this approach is applicable beyond the scenario presented herein requires further investigation.

29297764#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Disasters,, whether natural or manmade,, are unpredictable. While there may be some forewarning as in natural disasters like a hurricane,, response is often suboptimal. There is a need for an integrated and structured action for all three well defined phases of disaster management (pre-,, during,, and postdisaster) that must be addressed to ameliorate the impact on life and the necessary steps for recovery. Over the past several decades,, telemedicine has been integrated in some form of disaster response. This adoption and integration has been shown to be effective. Since 2013,, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),, under the auspices of the Science for Peace and Security Programme,, has worked on developing a Multinational Telemedicine System (MnTS) for disaster response.
29297764#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A group of subject matter experts from Europe and the United States developed the MnTS by establishing the network and a concept of operations,, to be used in disaster management between countries.
29297764#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#An integrated system,, including personnel,, hardware,, communication protocols,, portable power generation,, medical kits,, and Web-based tools,, was developed and successfully tested in the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre's Exercises Ukraine 2015. The field exercise tested and validated the MnTS and identified areas of improvement. The system and its evaluation provide additional information for establishing deployment capabilities.
29297764#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A MnTS approach to telemedicine in disaster response and management is possible and should be further advanced.

35704355#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Accurately assessing dietary intake can promote improved nutrition. The PortionSize app (Pennington Biomedical Research Center) was designed to quantify and provide real-time feedback on the intake of energy,, food groups,, saturated fat,, and added sugar.
35704355#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 15 adults (aged 18-65 years) were recruited and trained to quantify the food intake from a simulated meal by using PortionSize. Trained personnel prepared 15 simulated meals and covertly weighed (weigh back) the amount of food provided to participants as well as food waste. Equivalence tests (±25% bounds) were performed to compare PortionSize to the weigh back method.
35704355#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Participants were aged a mean of 28 (SD 12) years,, and 11 were female. The mean energy intake estimated with PortionSize was 742.9 (SD 328.2) kcal,, and that estimated via weigh back was 659.3 (SD 190.7) kcal (energy intake difference: mean 83.5,, SD 287.5 kcal). The methods were not equivalent in estimating energy intake (P=.18),, and PortionSize overestimated energy intake by 83.5 kcal (12.7%) at the meal level. Estimates of portion sizes (gram weight; P=.01),, total sugar (P=.049),, fruit servings (P=.01),, and dairy servings (P=.047) from PortionSize were equivalent to those estimated via weigh back. PortionSize was not equivalent to weigh back with regard to estimates for carbohydrate (P=.10),, fat (P=.32),, vegetable (P=.37),, grain (P=.31),, and protein servings (P=.87).
35704355#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Due to power limitations,, the equivalence tests had large equivalence bounds. Though preliminary,, the results of this small pilot study warrant the further adaptation,, development,, and validation of PortionSize as a means to estimate energy intake and provide users with real-time and actionable dietary feedback.

34463623#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In the recent decades,, the number of apps promoting health behaviors and health-related strategies and interventions has increased alongside the number of smartphone users. Nevertheless,, the validity process for measuring and reporting app quality remains unsatisfactory for health professionals and end users and represents a public health concern. The Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) is a tool validated and widely used in the scientific literature to evaluate and compare mHealth app functionalities. However,, MARS is not adapted to the French culture nor to the language.
34463623#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to translate,, adapt,, and validate the equivalent French version of MARS (ie,, MARS-F).
34463623#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original MARS was first translated to French by two independent bilingual scientists,, and their common version was blind back-translated twice by two native English speakers,, culminating in a final well-established MARS-F. Its comprehensibility was then evaluated by 6 individuals (3 researchers and 3 nonacademics),, and the final MARS-F version was created. Two bilingual raters independently completed the evaluation of 63 apps using MARS and MARS-F. Interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. In addition,, internal consistency and validity of both scales were assessed. Mokken scale analysis was used to investigate the scalability of both MARS and MARS-F.
34463623#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#MARS-F had a good alignment with the original MARS,, with properties comparable between the two scales. The correlation coefficients (r) between the corresponding dimensions of MARS and MARS-F ranged from 0.97 to 0.99. The internal consistencies of the MARS-F dimensions engagement (?=0.79),, functionality (?=0.79),, esthetics (?=0.78),, and information quality (?=0.61) were acceptable and that for the overall MARS score (?=0.86) was good. Mokken scale analysis revealed a strong scalability for MARS (Loevinger H=0.37) and a good scalability for MARS-F (H=0.35).
34463623#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MARS-F is a valid tool,, and it would serve as a crucial aid for researchers,, health care professionals,, public health authorities,, and interested third parties,, to assess the quality of mHealth apps in French-speaking countries.

19004646#ABSTRACT##The growing number of elderly and people with chronic disorders in our western society puts such a pressure on our healthcare system that innovative approaches are required to make our health care more effective and more efficient. One way of innovating healthcare can be obtained by introducing new services that support and enable these elderly and people with chronic disorders in a more independent living and in self management with respect to their disorders. Examples of such services are remote monitoring and remotely supervised training (together RMT). Remote monitoring focuses on continuous monitoring of the health status with the assurance of assistance whenever required. Remotely supervised training focuses on efficient and effective individually tailored training anywhere and anytime with intensity not feasible in an intramural setting. It is expected that services of remote monitoring and remotely supervised treatment will become important for at least patients (safety,, more in control,, convenience),, health care insurances (efficiency,, cost reduction) and healthcare service providers (more effective care). RMT systems are in general quite complex distributed Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. RMT systems integrate ambulant sensing to measure relevant biosignals and (possibly) subject's context information,, secure data transport and storage,, appropriate decisions support systems to assist in both technical and clinical decision making but also feedback on information to both patients and care providers. Feedback is essential for patients to make them aware of their health status,, to give them a feeling of safety and to motivate and enable them to change/improve their health status. Feedback of information to healthcare professionals enables them in making appropriate decisions and to monitor changes/improvements in a patient's health status. Despite this apparent complexity,, these systems must be very dependable to be accepted and used in a healthcare setting. During the past years knowledge and experience has been gained with the development of the building blocks of RMT systems. In parallel,, experience has been gained with respect to the challenges involved when using RMT systems in a clinical environment. Examples are: activity monitoring in low back pain,, monitoring of spasticity,, myofeedback in subjects with neck shoulder and lower back pain and post rehabilitation home training. Until now,, the main focus has been on the technical realization of the sensing and transportation part of it. The development of intelligent decision support systems is still in its infancy and clinical validation studies and models how to implement these services and how to make them profitable are largely lacking. In conclusion,, the combination of Biomedical Engineering with Information and Communication Technology has opened a new extensive area of research and development with a high potential to have substantial impact on our future healthcare.

33480854#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The classic Marshmallow Test,, where children were offered a choice between one small but immediate reward (eg,, one marshmallow) or a larger reward (eg,, two marshmallows) if they waited for a period of time,, instigated a wealth of research on the relationships among impulsive responding,, self-regulation,, and clinical and life outcomes. Impulsivity is a hallmark feature of self-regulation failures that lead to poor health decisions and outcomes,, making understanding and treating impulsivity one of the most important constructs to tackle in building a culture of health. Despite a large literature base,, impulsivity measurement remains difficult due to the multidimensional nature of the construct and limited methods of assessment in daily life. Mobile devices and the rise of mobile health (mHealth) have changed our ability to assess and intervene with individuals remotely,, providing an avenue for ambulatory diagnostic testing and interventions. Longitudinal studies with mobile devices can further help to understand impulsive behaviors and variation in state impulsivity in daily life.
33480854#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop and validate an impulsivity mHealth diagnostics and monitoring app called Digital Marshmallow Test (DMT) using both the Apple and Android platforms for widespread dissemination to researchers,, clinicians,, and the general public.
33480854#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The DMT app was developed using Apple's ResearchKit (iOS) and Android's ResearchStack open source frameworks for developing health research study apps. The DMT app consists of three main modules: self-report,, ecological momentary assessment,, and active behavioral and cognitive tasks. We conducted a study with a 21-day assessment period (N=116 participants) to validate the novel measures of the DMT app.
33480854#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We used a semantic differential scale to develop self-report trait and momentary state measures of impulsivity as part of the DMT app. We identified three state factors (inefficient,, thrill seeking,, and intentional) that correlated highly with established measures of impulsivity. We further leveraged momentary semantic differential questions to examine intraindividual variability,, the effect of daily life,, and the contextual effect of mood on state impulsivity and daily impulsive behaviors. Our results indicated validation of the self-report sematic differential and related results,, and of the mobile behavioral tasks,, including the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Go-No-Go task,, with relatively low validity of the mobile Delay Discounting task. We discuss the design implications of these results to mHealth research.
33480854#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study demonstrates the potential for assessing different facets of trait and state impulsivity during everyday life and in clinical settings using the DMT mobile app. The DMT app can be further used to enhance our understanding of the individual facets that underlie impulsive behaviors,, as well as providing a promising avenue for digital interventions.

34770244#ABSTRACT##Frailty syndrome is an independent risk factor for serious health episodes,, disability,, hospitalization,, falls,, loss of mobility,, and cardiovascular disease. Its high reversibility demands personalized interventions among which exercise programs are highly efficient to contribute to its delay. Information technology-based solutions to support frailty have been recently approached,, but most of them are focused on assessment and not on intervention. This paper describes a sensor-based mHealth platform integrated in a service-based architecture inside the FRAIL project towards the remote monitoring and intervention of pre-frail and frail patients at home. The aim of this platform is constituting an efficient and scalable system for reducing both the impact of aging and the advance of frailty syndrome. Among the results of this work are: (1) the development of elderly-focused sensors and platform; (2) a technical validation process of the sensor devices and the mHealth platform with young adults; and (3) an assessment of usability and acceptability of the devices with a set of pre-frail and frail patients. After the promising results obtained,, future steps of this work involve performing a clinical validation in order to quantify the impact of the platform on health outcomes of frail patients.

36449330#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite Catalonia being an advanced region in terms of digital health adoption,, the "Forum for Professional Dialogue" identified the need to improve information and communication technology (ICT) competences as one of the present and future challenges for health care professionals (HPs).
36449330#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to validate the digital competence test developed ad hoc for this study and to measure the digital competence level of Catalan HPs to establish their current level as the baseline for designing a strategic training plan.
36449330#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An exploratory observational study was conducted based on a voluntary survey where sociodemographic,, professional and digital tool knowledge,, digital tool use,, and training needs data were collected and based on the score obtained from a digital competence test developed ad hoc. The digital competence test consisted of 2 "real-life scenarios" with 7 and 11 questions.
36449330#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 803 HPs,, of whom 612 (76.2%) were women,, completed the survey between June 28 and July 16,, 2021. Most participants self-rated their digital competence level as either intermediate (384/803,, 47.8%) or basic (357/803,, 44.5%). The mean score in the digital competence test was 22.6 (SD 4.3). Therefore,, most participants displayed a basic level of digital competence. The internal consistency of the digital competence test was 0.66,, and the discrimination index of all questions was =0.2 for all items except for 1 question.
36449330#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This exploratory study highlights the need to improve the digital competence of HPs working in Catalonia,, with special effort being made to provide training according to the specific needs of the different HP profiles. The results have informed the Health Plan for Catalonia 2021-2025 and lay the foundations for the development and deployment of a framework program for the digital competences of HPs. The developed digital competence test shows acceptable consistency for the objective pursued,, although improvements are needed to fine-tune its accuracy.

34786796#ABSTRACT#STUDY RATIONALE#The swift progression of the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to facilitate the increase in telehealth utilization. However,, it is clear neither how telehealth was offered by providers nor how it was used by patients during this time of unusual and rapid change within the health industry.
34786796#ABSTRACT#AIM#To investigates the telehealth utilization patterns of Medicare beneficiaries during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
34786796#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND MATERIALS#A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the responses of 9686 Medicare beneficiaries to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,, Fall 2020 COVID-19 Supplement. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between telehealth offering and beneficiaries' sociodemographic variables.
34786796#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Over half (58%) of primary care providers provided telehealth services,, while only 26%-28% of specialists did. Less than 8% of Medicare beneficiaries reported that they were unable to obtain care because of COVID-19.
34786796#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This research found that changes in Medicare policy,, associated with CMS' declaration of telehealth waivers during the Public Health Emergency (PHE),, likely increased the proliferation and utilization of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic,, providing important access to care for certain populations. With the impending conclusion of the PHE,, policymakers must 1) ascertain which elements of the new telehealth landscape will be retained,, 2) modernize the regulatory,, accreditation and reimbursement framework to maintain pace with care model innovation and 3) address disparities in access to broadband connectivity with a particular focus on rural and underserved communities.

12517618#ABSTRACT##It is a universally accepted fact that the number of neurosurgeons in developing countries is woefully inadequate. It is also unrealistic to expect this limited number to work in professional isolation,, in suburban and rural areas,, without adequate infrastructure. Therefore,, this has resulted in concentration of neurosurgeons in developing countries,, in metropolitan areas,, even at the risk of being underemployed. The phenomenal advances in communications and information technology in India are resulting in a new look at how secondary and tertiary health care can be provided to the underprivileged masses. Following a proof of concept validation ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) in conjunction with the Apollo Hospitals,, is ready to use satellite technology to provide specialist care not only to suburban and rural India but to other countries as well,, by using the large number of highly qualified and trained specialists in urban India. The implications of these developments for the delivery of neurosurgical care to suburban and rural India is briefly reviewed.

27044849#ABSTRACT##A multitude of mental health apps are available to consumers through the Apple and Google app stores. However,, evidence supporting the effectiveness of mHealth is scant. We argue this gap between app availability and research evidence is primarily due to unsuitable knowledge translation practices and therefore suggest abandoning the randomised controlled trial as the primary app evaluation paradigm. Alternative evaluation methodologies such as iterative participatory research and single case designs are better aligned with mHealth translational needs. A further challenge to the use of mobile technology in mental health is the dissemination of information about app quality to consumers. Strategies to facilitate successful dissemination of quality resources must consider several factors,, such as target audience and context. In practice,, structured solutions to inform consumers of evidence-informed apps could range from the development of consumer used tools to app accreditation portals. Consumer enthusiasm for apps represents an opportunity to increase access and support for psychiatric populations. However,, adoption of alternative research methodologies and the development of dissemination strategies are vital before this opportunity can be substantially seized.
33965925#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile apps may encourage a lifestyle that avoids unhealthy behaviors,, such as smoking or poor nutrition,, which promotes cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Yet,, little data is available on the utilization,, perception,, and long-term effects of such apps to prevent CVD.
33965925#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To develop a mobile app concept to reduce the individual CVD risk and collect information addressing research questions on CVD prevention while preserving data privacy and security.
33965925#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#To address CVD prevention,, we propose a mobile coaching app. We expect high acceptance rates in validation studies.

30235937#ABSTRACT##Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions have become effective strategies to increase adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in people living with HIV (PLWH). mHealth interventions use phone calls,, e-mails,, smartphone apps or short text messages (SMS) as reminders of medical appointments or ART adherence. SMS are a highly accepted mHealth strategy. Systematized processes to validate SMS tailored to end-user preferences are required to increase the effectiveness of mHealth interventions. We describe a structured approach to develop a set of SMS tailored to Mexican HIV+ individuals,, focused on improving ART adherence and healthcare appointments. The process included three sequential phases: SMS design by HIV-healthcare professionals,, validation by expert referees,, and testing by PLWH. A set of 108 SMS in four categories (motivational self-healthcare messages,, ART-collection,, medical and laboratory-appointment reminders) was designed. Expert referees assessed 94.5% of messages as adequate,, 65.7% as useful. Seventy-one SMS were further tested by PLWH,, who considered 100% of SMS to be understandable and 57.7% useful. SMS had adequate intra-judge agreement scores for clarity and acceptability (ICC-2?=?.08-.49). Qualitative feedback from expert referees and PLWH was incorporated into SMS. A final set of 41 highest-rated SMS was obtained. Careful validation of SMS could increase the effectiveness of mHealth interventions.

32576174#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Studies document e-health as having potential to improve quality of healthcare services,, resulting in both developed and developing countries demonstrating continued interest in e-health uptake and use. e-Health implementations are not always successful as high failure rates have been reported in both developed and developing countries. These failures are often a result of lack of e-health readiness. e-Health readiness has been defined as the preparedness of healthcare institutions or communities for the anticipated change brought by programs related to information and communication technologies. As such it is critical to conduct an e-health readiness assessment prior to implementation of e-health innovations so as to reduce chances of project failure. Noting the absence of an adequate e-health readiness assessment framework (eHRAF) suitable for use in developing countries,, the authors conceptualised,, designed,, and created a developing country specific eHRAF to aid in e-health policy planning. The aim of this study was to validate the developed eHRAF and to determine if it required further refinement before empirical testing.
32576174#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Published options for a framework validation process were adopted,, and fifteen globally located e-health experts engaged. Botswana experts were engaged using saturation sampling,, while international experts were purposively selected. Responses were collated in an Excel spreadsheet,, and NVivo 11 software used to aid thematic analysis of the open ended questions.
32576174#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Analysis of responses showed overall support for the content and format of the proposed eHRAF. Equivocal responses to some open ended questions were recorded,, most of which suggested modifications to terms within the framework. One expert from the developed world had alternate views.
32576174#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed eHRAF provides guidance for e-health policy development and planning by identifying,, in an evidence based manner,, the major areas to be considered when preparing for an e-health readiness assessment in the context of developing countries.

31667819#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Limited research has investigated the facilitators and barriers for the adoption of M-Health in developing countries to secure successful implementation of the technology. To fill this knowledge gap,, we propose an integrative model that explains the patient's adoption behavior of M-Health in developing countries grounded on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,, dual-factor model,, and health belief model.
31667819#ABSTRACT#METHOD#We empirically tested and evaluated the model based on data collected using a survey method from 280 patients living in a developing country. Partial least squares (PLS-SEM) technique was used for data analysis.
31667819#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results showed that performance expectancy,, effort expectancy,, social influence,, perceived health threat,, M-Health app quality,, and life quality expectancy have a direct positive effect on patients' intention to use M-Health. The results also showed that security and privacy risks have a direct negative effect on the patient's intention to use M-Health. However,, resistance to change was found to have an indirect negative effect on patients' intention to use M-Health through the performance expectancy.
31667819#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The research contributes to the existing literature of health information systems and M-Health by better understanding how technological,, social,, and functional factors are associated with digital health applications and services use and success in the context of developing countries. With the widespread availability of mobile technologies and services and the growing demand for M-Health apps,, this research can help guide the development of the next generation of M-Health apps with a focus on the needs of patients in developing countries. The research has several theoretical and practical implications for the health care industry,, government,, policy makers,, and technology developers and designers.

33512328#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Recent years have witnessed a constant increase in the number of people with chronic conditions requiring ongoing medical support in their everyday lives. However,, global health systems are not adequately equipped for this extraordinarily time-consuming and cost-intensive development. Here,, conversational agents (CAs) can offer easily scalable and ubiquitous support. Moreover,, different aspects of CAs have not yet been sufficiently investigated to fully exploit their potential. One such trait is the interaction style between patients and CAs. In human-to-human settings,, the interaction style is an imperative part of the interaction between patients and physicians. Patient-physician interaction is recognized as a critical success factor for patient satisfaction,, treatment adherence,, and subsequent treatment outcomes. However,, so far,, it remains effectively unknown how different interaction styles can be implemented into CA interactions and whether these styles are recognizable by users.
33512328#ABSTRACT#METHODS#On the basis of the Roter Interaction Analysis System and iterative evaluations by scientific experts and medical health care professionals,, we identified 10 communication components that characterize the 2 developed interaction styles: deliberative and paternalistic interaction styles. These communication components were used to develop 2 CA variations,, each representing one of the 2 interaction styles. We assessed them in a web-based between-subject experiment. The participants were asked to put themselves in the position of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These participants were randomly assigned to interact with one of the 2 CAs and subsequently asked to identify the respective interaction style. Chi-square test was used to assess the correct identification of the CA-patient interaction style.
33512328#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We developed an approach that is tailored for a medical context to induce a paternalistic and deliberative interaction style into a written interaction between a patient and a CA. We successfully tested and validated the procedure in a web-based experiment involving 88 participants. Future research should implement and test this approach among actual patients with chronic diseases and compare the results in different medical conditions. This approach can further be used as a starting point to develop dynamic CAs that adapt their interaction styles to their users.

36538379#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The lack of an international standard for assessing and communicating health app quality and the lack of consensus about what makes a high-quality health app negatively affect the uptake of such apps. At the request of the European Commission,, the international Standard Development Organizations (SDOs),, European Committee for Standardization,, International Organization for Standardization,, and International Electrotechnical Commission have joined forces to develop a technical specification (TS) for assessing the quality and reliability of health and wellness apps.
36538379#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to create a useful,, globally applicable,, trustworthy,, and usable framework to assess health app quality.
36538379#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A useful and usable international standard for health app quality assessment was developed. Its quality,, approval rate,, and early use provide proof of its potential to become the trusted,, commonly used global framework. The framework will help manufacturers enhance and efficiently demonstrate the quality of health apps,, consumers,, and health care professionals to make informed decisions on health apps. It will also help insurers to make reimbursement decisions on health apps.

36538379#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A 2-round Delphi technique with 83 experts from 6 continents (predominantly Europe) participating in one (n=42,, 51%) or both (n=41,, 49%) rounds was used to achieve consensus on a framework for assessing health app quality. Aims included identifying the maximum 100 requirement questions for the uptake of apps that do or do not qualify as medical devices. The draft assessment framework was built on 26 existing frameworks,, the principles of stringent legislation,, and input from 20 core experts. A follow-up survey with 28 respondents informed a scoring mechanism for the questions. After subsequent alignment with related standards,, the quality assessment framework was tested and fine-tuned with manufacturers of 11 COVID-19 symptom apps. National mirror committees from the 52 countries that participated in the SDO technical committees were invited to comment on 4 working drafts and subsequently vote on the TS.
36538379#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The final quality assessment framework includes 81 questions,, 67 (83%) of which impact the scores of 4 overarching quality aspects. After testing with people with low health literacy,, these aspects were phrased as "Healthy and safe,," "Easy to use,," "Secure data,," and "Robust build." The scoring mechanism enables communication of the quality assessment results in a health app quality score and label,, alongside a detailed report. Unstructured interviews with stakeholders revealed that evidence and third-party assessment are needed for health app uptake. The manufacturers considered the time needed to complete the assessment and gather evidence (2-4 days) acceptable. Publication of CEN-ISO/TS 82304-2:2021 Health software - Part 2: Health and wellness apps - Quality and reliability was approved in May 2021 in a nearly unanimous vote by 34 national SDOs,, including 6 of the 10 most populous countries worldwide.

34391568#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Technology is becoming increasingly integrated into healthcare,, including the rapid development of mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) for various medical conditions such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). As patients turn to these sources more frequently,, closer evaluation of the apps becomes more important.
34391568#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To (1) evaluate free applications designed for POP and urinary incontinence using the Xcertia guidelines for medical app quality,, (2) analyze user sentiment of the apps,, and (3) evaluate app information for quality,, understandability,, and actionability with the DISCERN and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) tools.
34391568#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Mobile medical apps were identified on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store with keywords "pelvic organ prolapse,," "incontinence,," or "bladder." Exclusion criteria included 1) not free,, 2) not updated in past year,, 3) required a product for use,, 4) not in English. Apps were evaluated using the Xcertia Guidelines. Categories included Operability,, Privacy,, Security,, Content,, and Usability. Ratings and sentiment of reviews were assessed,, and associations analyzed with one-sided Fisher's exact test. Apps with an informational component were evaluated for quality,, usability and actionability using DISCERN and PEMAT criteria.
34391568#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, a total of 73 apps were found and 28 were included. There was an average number of ratings of 2341 and an average score of 3.39 for all the apps included. The average number of reviews was 216.2,, with the majority of reviews having positive sentiment. A high number of ratings was associated with a high rating score (p < 0.05) and a high number of reviews was associated with a high percentage of positive reviews (p < 0.05). Based on Xcertia Guidelines,, all apps met the guidelines for privacy,, security,, and usability. Regarding content,, 67.9 % of apps incorporated an informational component,, but only 17.9 % delineated sources. The average DISCERN score for information quality indicated good quality information (>3). The average PEMAT scores for Understandability and Actionability were 90.6 % and 86.6 %,, respectively,, which are good scores (=75 %).
34391568#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Most free apps were functional and well received by users,, however quality of app content varied. Only some apps had an informational component,, and even fewer had sources listed. Providers recommending health apps should consider those that meet Xcertia guidelines,, have reliable information,, and have good understandability and actionability.

27796920#ABSTRACT##Many regions in the United States are deficient in mental health services,, especially those in rural areas. As a result of these deficiencies,, many patients in need of psychiatric services are often left untreated. Although it is clear that telepsychiatry has great potential in improving patient access to mental health care in areas where psychiatric services are deficient,, the lack of familiarity with the technology and inadequate training are current barriers to expanding the use of telepsychiatry. A review of telepsychiatry,, its clinical applications,, and evidence-based literature regarding competencies in graduate medical education related to telepsychiatry are provided. An approach to implementing telepsychiatry into a curriculum is suggested. We also propose an elective clinical experience with resources for didactics or independent study that will enable residents to develop a knowledge base and competence in the practice of telepsychiatry.

28821474#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of mobile devices for data collection in developing world settings is becoming increasingly common and may offer advantages in data collection quality and efficiency relative to paper-based methods. However,, mobile data collection systems can hamper many standard quality assurance techniques due to the lack of a hardcopy backup of data. Consequently,, mobile health data collection platforms have the potential to generate datasets that appear valid,, but are susceptible to unidentified database design flaws,, areas of miscomprehension by enumerators,, and data recording errors.

29748163#ABSTRACT#METHODS#From 2011 to 2015,, scales were continuously tested and developed in an iterative process,, which led to 7 tools being included in the validation study. The eHLA validation version consisted of 4 health-related tools (tool 1: "functional health literacy,," tool 2: "health literacy self-assessment,," tool 3: "familiarity with health and health care,," and tool 4: "knowledge of health and disease") and 3 digitally-related tools (tool 5: "technology familiarity,," tool 6: "technology confidence,," and tool 7: "incentives for engaging with technology") that were tested in 475 respondents from a general population sample and an outpatient clinic. Statistical analyses examined floor and ceiling effects,, interitem correlations,, item-total correlations,, and Cronbach coefficient alpha (CCA). Rasch models (RM) examined the fit of data. Tools were reduced in items to secure robust tools fit for screening purposes. Reductions were made based on psychometrics,, face validity,, and content validity.
29748163#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Tool 1 was not reduced in items; it consequently consists of 10 items. The overall fit to the RM was acceptable (Anderson conditional likelihood ratio,, CLR=10.8; df=9; P=.29),, and CCA was .67. Tool 2 was reduced from 20 to 9 items. The overall fit to a log-linear RM was acceptable (Anderson CLR=78.4,, df=45,, P=.002),, and CCA was .85. Tool 3 was reduced from 23 to 5 items. The final version showed excellent fit to a log-linear RM (Anderson CLR=47.7,, df=40,, P=.19),, and CCA was .90. Tool 4 was reduced from 12 to 6 items. The fit to a log-linear RM was acceptable (Anderson CLR=42.1,, df=18,, P=.001),, and CCA was .59. Tool 5 was reduced from 20 to 6 items. The fit to the RM was acceptable (Anderson CLR=30.3,, df=17,, P=.02),, and CCA was .94. Tool 6 was reduced from 5 to 4 items. The fit to a log-linear RM taking local dependency (LD) into account was acceptable (Anderson CLR=26.1,, df=21,, P=.20),, and CCA was .91. Tool 7 was reduced from 6 to 4 items. The fit to a log-linear RM taking LD and differential item functioning into account was acceptable (Anderson CLR=23.0,, df=29,, P=.78),, and CCA was .90.
29748163#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The eHLA consists of 7 short,, robust scales that assess individual's knowledge and skills related to digital literacy and health literacy.

32730266#ABSTRACT#CONTEXT#The increase in the population aging has brought more significant concern about how proper care will be provided to the elderly in the future. Thus,, the development of technological solutions for the health domain has gained more prominence. Joining this scenario to the growing use of mobile devices for daily activities,, several mobile applications focused on the elderly healthcare have been developed with healthcare and software engineer professionals involved. However,, there is no survey to help both professionals to take decisions on the target of application,, elderly profile,, empirical validation techniques,, among others. Thus,, the following question arises: how have mobile applications for elderly healthcare been addressed in the literature in the past years?
32730266#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To identify the state of the art in the literature concerned with the development of mobile applications for elderly healthcare,, considering healthcare and software Engineering viewpoints.
32730266#ABSTRACT#METHOD#We performed a systematic mapping conducted by health and software engineering researchers to provide an interdisciplinary investigation of the papers that address mobile applications for elderly healthcare,, summarizing the data collected under the following classification: target of application,, older adult profile,, spatial-temporal distribution,, techniques for empirical validation and type of software engineering research.
32730266#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We found a total of 2533 papers and,, after applying our eligibility criteria,, we got 149. We observed aspects related to the digital health initiative type,, using the classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO),, the elderly profile prioritized by the application,, the spatial-temporal distribution of the studies,, the empirical validation type,, and the research contribution of each analyzed paper to the software engineering area.
32730266#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Regarding the WHO classification,, we noticed that two categories were more frequently found,, Clients and Data Services,, and that none of the mobile apps were classified in the Health System Manager category. The data extraction result also reveals that most of the applications found in the literature focused on the independent elderly. Moreover,, we observed that most of the studies were proposals of solutions for elderly health and the validation process of these solutions generally consisted of controlled experiments and usability evaluations. At last,, the research focused on mobile applications for elderly healthcare has been performed mostly by developed countries.

28821474#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We describe the design and evaluation of a strategy for estimating data error rates and assessing enumerator performance during electronic data collection,, which we term "validation relaxation." Validation relaxation involves the intentional omission of data validation features for select questions to allow for data recording errors to be committed,, detected,, and monitored.
28821474#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We analyzed data collected during a cluster sample population survey in rural Liberia using an electronic data collection system (Open Data Kit). We first developed a classification scheme for types of detectable errors and validation alterations required to detect them. We then implemented the following validation relaxation techniques to enable data error conduct and detection: intentional redundancy,, removal of "required" constraint,, and illogical response combinations. This allowed for up to 11 identifiable errors to be made per survey. The error rate was defined as the total number of errors committed divided by the number of potential errors. We summarized crude error rates and estimated changes in error rates over time for both individuals and the entire program using logistic regression.
28821474#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The aggregate error rate was 1.60% (125/7817). Error rates did not differ significantly between enumerators (P=.51),, but decreased for the cohort with increasing days of application use,, from 2.3% at survey start (95% CI 1.8%-2.8%) to 0.6% at day 45 (95% CI 0.3%-0.9%; OR=0.969; P<.001). The highest error rate (84/618,, 13.6%) occurred for an intentional redundancy question for a birthdate field,, which was repeated in separate sections of the survey. We found low error rates (0.0% to 3.1%) for all other possible errors.
28821474#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A strategy of removing validation rules on electronic data capture platforms can be used to create a set of detectable data errors,, which can subsequently be used to assess group and individual enumerator error rates,, their trends over time,, and categories of data collection that require further training or additional quality control measures. This strategy may be particularly useful for identifying individual enumerators or systematic data errors that are responsive to enumerator training and is best applied to questions for which errors cannot be prevented through training or software design alone. Validation relaxation should be considered as a component of a holistic data quality assurance strategy.

29297770#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#The primary aim of this study is to explain the extent to which and how coordination practices between pathologists,, technologists,, and surgeons are transformed when telepathology is being implemented.
29297770#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#An interpretive case study was conducted. A total of 60 semistructured interviews with key participants were conducted,, in addition to several days of direct observation of telepathology-based intraoperative consultations (IOCs).
29297770#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Three major kinds of transformation of coordination practices were observed. First,, the telepathology system itself constrains and disrupts coordination routines,, such as the presentation of slides. Second,, anticipating IOC,, proactively performed by the laboratory personnel in traditional settings,, requires more formal requests in a telepathology context. Third,, local technologists become more autonomous in performing complex macroscopy manipulations and managing the laboratory tasks traditionally performed by pathologists.
29297770#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Successful coordination of work in a telepathology-based IOC context requires that significant transformations be anticipated and accounted for. Project managers need to formalize new work processes,, support the transformations in professional roles,, and mitigate the major hindrances that small material changes may have on work routines.

36853753#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to develop a novel system to assess the presence of NNJ. The device should provide accurate results,, be approved as a medical device,, be easy to use,, and be produced at a price that is affordable even in low-resource settings.
36853753#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used an iterative approach to develop a smartphone-based system to detect the presence of NNJ. We performed technical development,, followed by clinical and usability testing in parallel,, after which we initiated the regulatory processes for certification. We updated the system in each iteration,, and the final version underwent a clinical validation study on healthy term newborns aged 1 to 15 days before all documentation was submitted for conformity assessment to obtain Conformité Européenne (CE) certification. We developed a system that incorporates a smartphone app,, a color calibration card,, and a server.
36853753#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Three iterations of the smartphone-based system were developed; the final version was approved as a medical device after complying with Medical Device Regulation guidelines. A total of 201 infants were included in the validation study. Bilirubin values using the system highly correlated with total serum or plasma bilirubin levels (r=0.84). The system had a high sensitivity (94%) to detect severe jaundice,, defined as total serum or plasma bilirubin >250 µmol/L,, and maintained a high specificity (71%).
36853753#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our smartphone-based system has a high potential as a tool for identifying NNJ. An iterative approach to product development,, conducted by working on different tasks in parallel,, resulted in a functional and successful product. By adhering to the requirements for regulatory approval from the beginning of the project,, we were able to develop a market-ready mobile health solution.

18305322#ABSTRACT##Over the past several decades the concept of telemedicine has evolved to be more commonplace with many unique applications. These applications have been made possible by overcoming challenges and barriers that have been present for most of telemedicine's development. The application of telemedicine continues to undergo growth and scrutiny. However,, the rapid infusion of technology continues to serve as a catalyst for adoption and validation. Looking into the future requires a review of the past. Overcoming barriers and challenges has not been easy. Many have been minimized,, in part because of technologies rapid flow and diffusion. Yet there are still significant challenges that must be overcome. In many parts of the world,, healthcare and education are limited because of access. This has been driven by many influences,, which continue to have an impact,, albeit in many cases,, minimal. Future generations of telemedicine users will look back at this period as one of transition. The first 30 years or so of telemedicine implementation were fraught with barriers and challenges. The next 30 years will see and entirely different paradigm of practicing medicine,, including consumerism and smart systems.
35790332#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Every year 2.4?million deaths occur worldwide in babies younger than 28 days. Approximately 70% of these deaths occur in low-resource settings because of failure to implement evidence-based interventions. Digital health technologies may offer an implementation solution. Since 2014,, we have worked in Bangladesh,, Malawi,, Zimbabwe and the UK to develop and pilot Neotree: an android app with accompanying data visualisation,, linkage and export. Its low-cost hardware and state-of-the-art software are used to improve bedside postnatal care and to provide insights into population health trends,, to impact wider policy and practice.
35790332#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS#This is a mixed methods (1) intervention codevelopment and optimisation and (2) pilot implementation evaluation (including economic evaluation) study. Neotree will be implemented in two hospitals in Zimbabwe,, and one in Malawi. Over the 2-year study period clinical and demographic newborn data will be collected via Neotree,, in addition to behavioural science informed qualitative and quantitative implementation evaluation and measures of cost,, newborn care quality and usability. Neotree clinical decision support algorithms will be optimised according to best available evidence and clinical validation studies.

30954644#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) apps have the potential to facilitate asthma self-management by including medication reminders,, allowing self-monitoring of symptoms,, improving access and quality of information communicated with provider,, and providing educational resources to patients and parents. Many apps exist for asthma management; however,, the extent to which apps include evidence-based behavior change strategies has not been examined.
30954644#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To review the content and quality of mHealth asthma management apps that are available to patients.
30954644#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Asthma apps were identified using a systematic search process. Twenty-three apps were coded for presence or absence of behavior change techniques (BCTs) using the taxonomy of BCTs as defined by Abraham and Michie in 2008. Quality ratings were also determined for each app using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).
30954644#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The number of BCTs each app used ranged from 1 to 11 (mean,, 4). BCTs that were most commonly used were instruction,, behavior-health link,, self-monitoring,, feedback,, teach to use prompts/cues,, consequences,, and others' approval. Overall app quality based on MARS scores ranged from 2.45 to 4.50 (mean,, 3.32). Two apps,, Kiss myAsthma and AsthmaMD,, used at least 8 BCTs and had high quality ratings.
30954644#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Kiss myAsthma and AsthmaMD used at least 8 BCTs and had good quality scores.

31022750#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#This paper provides a discussion about the potential scope of applicability of Artificial Intelligence methods within the telehealth domain. These methods are focussed on clinical needs and provide some insight to current directions,, based on reports of recent advances.
31022750#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Examples of telehealth innovations involving Artificial Intelligence to support or supplement remote health care delivery were identified from recent literature by the authors,, on the basis of expert knowledge. Observations from the examples were synthesized to yield an overview of contemporary directions for the perceived role of Artificial Intelligence in telehealth.
31022750#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Two major focus areas for related contemporary directions were established. These were first,, quality improvement for existing clinical practice and service delivery,, and second,, the development and support of new models of care. Case studies from each focus area have been chosen for illustration purposes.
31022750#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Examples of the role of Artificial Intelligence in delivery of health care remotely include use of tele-assessment,, tele-diagnosis,, tele-interactions,, and tele-monitoring. Further developments of underlying algorithms and validation of methods will be required for wider adoption. Certain key social and ethical considerations also need consideration more generally in the health system,, as Artificial-Intelligence-enabled-telehealth becomes more commonplace.

26329639#ABSTRACT##The delivery of healthcare services has experienced tremendous changes during the last years. Mobile health or mHealth is a key engine of advance in the forefront of this revolution. Although there exists a growing development of mobile health applications,, there is a lack of tools specifically devised for their implementation. This work presents mHealthDroid,, an open source Android implementation of a mHealth Framework designed to facilitate the rapid and easy development of mHealth and biomedical apps. The framework is particularly planned to leverage the potential of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets,, wearable sensors and portable biomedical systems. These devices are increasingly used for the monitoring and delivery of personal health care and wellbeing. The framework implements several functionalities to support resource and communication abstraction,, biomedical data acquisition,, health knowledge extraction,, persistent data storage,, adaptive visualization,, system management and value-added services such as intelligent alerts,, recommendations and guidelines. An exemplary application is also presented along this work to demonstrate the potential of mHealthDroid. This app is used to investigate on the analysis of human behavior,, which is considered to be one of the most prominent areas in mHealth. An accurate activity recognition model is developed and successfully validated in both offline and online conditions.

34383668#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the availability of thousands of health apps worldwide,, when considering those addressing children's first 1000 days of life,, most apps fail to consider the continuity between the prenatal and postnatal stages,, and their joint impact on maternal and child health. The reliability,, quality,, and effectiveness of these apps are largely unknown,, and the provided content seems questionable in terms of completeness,, updating,, and trustworthiness.
34383668#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study evaluates available Italian pregnancy and postnatal care apps to highlight the main gaps to be overcome and the resulting future challenges to be met in this mobile health-related field.
34383668#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search was conducted on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store,, and basic information was collected for all identified apps. After deduplication and further selection based on the exclusion criteria,, an in-depth analysis of each app was performed by two researchers independently. A 71-item six-domain questionnaire about the desirable features of apps was used to assess information,, functionalities,, and technical features,, while the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) was employed for app quality evaluation.

28958850#ABSTRACT##Despite considerable investment in digital health (DH) companies and a growing DH ecosystem,, there are multiple challenges to testing and implementing innovative solutions. Health systems have recognized the potential of DH and have formed DH innovation centers. However,, limited information is available on DH innovation center processes,, best practices,, or outcomes. This case report describes a DH innovation center process that can be replicated across health systems and defines and benchmarks process indicators to assess DH innovation center performance. The Brigham and Women's Hospital's Digital Health Innovation Group (DHIG) accelerates DH innovations from idea to pilot safely and efficiently using a structured process. Fifty-four DH innovations were accelerated by the DHIG process between July 2014 and December 2016. In order to measure effectiveness of the DHIG process,, key process indicators were defined as 1) number of solutions that completed each DHIG phase and 2) length of time to complete each phase. Twenty-three DH innovations progressed to pilot stage and 13 innovations were terminated after barriers to pilot implementation were identified by the DHIG process. For 4 DH solutions that executed a pilot,, the average time for innovations to proceed from DHIG intake to pilot initiation was 9 months. Overall,, the DHIG is a reproducible process that addresses key roadblocks in DH innovation within health systems. To our knowledge,, this is the first report to describe DH innovation process indicators and results within an academic health system. Therefore,, there is no published data to compare our results with the results of other DH innovation centers. Standardized data collection and indicator reporting could allow benchmark comparisons across institutions. Additional opportunities exist for the validation of DH solution effectiveness and for translational support from pilot to implementation. These are critical steps to advance DH technologies and effectively leverage the DH ecosystem to transform healthcare.
34383668#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From an initial sample of 684 apps,, 22 were deeply analyzed. Most apps did not fulfill the expectations,, as just one achieved 50% of all desirable aspects. Postnatal care and counselling for both the mother and child was the least accomplished domain. Moreover,, the quality of app information was generally rated more negatively than the quality of their functionality and esthetic features. The lacking aspects were information about methods for postpartum family planning and birth spacing (1/22,, 5%) and immunization (2/22,, 9%).
34383668#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The identified gaps could serve as a basis for designing and implementing increasingly high-quality,, targeted,, and effective apps for pregnancy and postnatal health care,, which provide comprehensive,, reliable,, and evidence-based information,, as well as appropriate esthetic and functional characteristics,, with relevant implications in terms of maternal and newborn health prevention and promotion.

30683106#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Assessing daily change in pain and related symptoms help in diagnosis,, prognosis,, and monitoring response to treatment. However,, such changes are infrequently assessed,, and usually reviewed weeks or months after the start of treatment. We therefore developed a smartphone application (Keele Pain Recorder) to record information on the severity and impact of pain on daily life. Specifically,, the study goal was to assess face,, content and construct validity of data collection using the Pain Recorder in primary care patients receiving new analgesic prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain,, as well as to assess its acceptability and clinical utility.
30683106#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The app was developed with Keele's Research User Group (RUG),, a clinical advisory group (CAG) and software developer for use on Android devices. The app recorded pain levels,, interference,, sleep disturbance,, analgesic use,, mood and side effects. In a feasibility study,, patients aged >?18 attending their general practitioner (GP) with a painful musculoskeletal condition were recruited to use the app twice per day for 28?days. Face and construct validity were assessed through baseline and post-study questionnaires (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). Usability and acceptability were determined through post-study questionnaires,, and patient,, GP,, RUG and CAG interviews.
30683106#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#An app was developed which was liked by both patients and GPs. It was felt that it offered the opportunity for GPs to discuss pain control with their patients in a new way. All participants found the app easy to use (it did not interfere with their activities) and results easy to interpret. Strong associations existed between the first 3?days (Spearman r?=?0.79) and last 3?days (r?=?0.60) of pain levels and intensity scores on the app with the validated questionnaires.
30683106#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Collaborating with patient representatives and clinical stakeholders,, we developed an app which can be used to help clinicians and patients monitor painful musculoskeletal conditions in response to analgesic prescribing. Recordings were accurate and valid,, especially,, for pain intensity ratings,, and it was easy to use. Future work needs to examine how pain trajectories can help manage changes in a patient's condition,, ultimately assisting in self-management.

31796039#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication technology to remotely provide healthcare services. Evaluation of telemedicine use often relies on administrative data,, but the validity of identifying telemedicine encounters in administrative data is not known. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of billing codes for identifying telemedicine use.
31796039#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this retrospective study of encounters within a large integrated health system from January 2016 to December 2017,, we examined the accuracy of billing codes for identifying live-interactive and store-and-forward telemedicine encounters compared to manual chart review. To further examine external validity,, we applied these codes and assessed patient and visit characteristics for identified live-interactive telemedicine encounters and store-and-forward telemedicine encounters in a second data set.
31796039#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In manual review of 390 encounters,, 75 encounters were live-interactive telemedicine and 158 were store-and-forward telemedicine. In weighted analysis,, the presence of the GT modifier in the absence of the GQ modifier or CPT code 99444 yielded 100% sensitivity and 99.99% specificity for identification of live-interactive telemedicine encounters. The presence of either the GQ modifier or the CPT code 99444 had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for identification of store-and-forward telemedicine encounters. Applying these algorithms to a second data set (n =?5,,917,,555) identified telemedicine encounters with expected patient and visit characteristics.
31796039#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These findings provide support for use of CPT codes to perform telemedicine research in administrative data,, aiding ongoing work to understand the role of non-face-to-face care in optimizing health care delivery.

36772246#ABSTRACT##Tele-rehabilitation has the potential to considerably change the way patients are monitored from their homes during the care process,, by providing equitable access without the need to travel to rehab centers or shoulder the high cost of personal in-home services. Developing a tele-rehab platform with the capability of automating exercise guidance is likely to have a significant impact on rehabilitation outcomes. In this paper,, a new vision-based biofeedback system is designed and validated to identify the quality of performed exercises. This new system will help patients to refine their movements to get the most out of their plan of care. An open dataset was used,, which consisted of data from 30 participants performing nine different exercises. Each exercise was labeled as "Correctly" or "Incorrectly" executed by five clinicians. We used a pre-trained 3D Convolution Neural Network (3D-CNN) to design our biofeedback system. The proposed system achieved average accuracy values of 90.57% ± 9.17% and 83.78% ± 7.63% using 10-Fold and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross validation,, respectively. In addition,, we obtained average F1-scores of 71.78% ± 5.68% using 10-Fold and 60.64% ± 21.3% using LOSO validation. The proposed 3D-CNN was able to classify the rehabilitation videos and feedback on the quality of exercises to help users modify their movement patterns.

33118941#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Screening for influenza in primary care is challenging due to the low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests and the lack of proper screening tests.
33118941#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning-based screening tool using patient-generated health data (PGHD) obtained from a mobile health (mHealth) app.
33118941#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We achieved reliable performance with an accuracy of 82%,, a sensitivity of 84%,, and a specificity of 80% in the test set. After the effect of each input variable was evaluated,, app-based surveillance was observed to be the most influential variable. The correlation between the duration of input data and performance was not statistically significant (P=.09).

33118941#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We trained a deep learning model based on a gated recurrent unit to screen influenza using PGHD,, including each patient's fever pattern and drug administration records. We used meteorological data and app-based surveillance of the weekly number of patients with influenza. We defined a single episode as the set of consecutive days,, including the day the user was diagnosed with influenza or another disease. Any record a user entered 24 hours after his or her last record was considered to be the start of a new episode. Each episode contained data on the user's age,, gender,, weight,, and at least one body temperature record. The total number of episodes was 6657. Of these,, there were 3326 episodes within which influenza was diagnosed. We divided these episodes into 80% training sets (2664/3330) and 20% test sets (666/3330). A 5-fold cross-validation was used on the training set.
33118941#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These findings suggest that PGHD from an mHealth app could be a complementary tool for influenza screening. In addition,, PGHD,, along with traditional clinical data,, could be used to improve health conditions.

36761328#ABSTRACT##Mobile health (mHealth) development has advanced rapidly,, indicating promise as an effective patient intervention. mHealth has many potential benefits that could help the treatment of patients,, and the development of rehabilitation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). mHealth is a low-cost option that does not need rapid access to healthcare clinics or employees. It increases the feasibility and rationality of clinical treatment expectations in comparison to the conventional clinical model of management by promoting patient adherence to the treatment plan. mHealth can also serve as a basis for formulating treatment plans and partially compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional model. In addition,, mHealth can help achieve universal rehabilitation service coverage by overcoming geographical barriers,, thereby increasing the number of ways patients can benefit from the rehabilitation service,, and by providing rehabilitation to individuals in remote areas and communities with insufficient healthcare services. However,, despite these positive potential aspects,, there is currently only a very limited number of studies performed in LMICs using mHealth. In this study,, we first reviewed the current evidence supporting the use of mHealth in rehabilitation to identify the countries where studies have been carried out. Then,, we identify the current limitations of the implementation of such mHealth solutions and propose a 10-point action plan,, focusing on the macro (e.g.,, policymakers),, meso (e.g.,, technology and healthcare institutions),, and micro (e.g.,, patients and relatives) levels to ease the use,, validation,, and implementation in LMICs and thus participate in the development and recognition of public health and rehabilitation in these countries.

31778120#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As the population ages,, many more people will be in need of long-term care. According to a recent report by Alzheimer's Disease International and the Karolinska Institute,, 84% of people with dementia are cared for at home and 16% in nursing homes. Several Web-based interventions have been developed to assist the work of carers at home. Measuring the levels of electronic health (eHealth) literacy is of top priority to facilitate inclusion of this population and develop training programs to enhance eHealth literacy skills.

The participants were mostly women (75.2%,, 76/101),, aged less than 60 years (67.3%,, 68/101) with secondary education. The internal consistency was estimated at a Cronbach alpha of .83. Two factors were extracted from the EFA: information seeking questions 1 to 5 (factor 1) and evaluation questions 6 to 8 (factor 2).
31778120#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#eHeals-Carer is the first perceived eHealth literacy tool adapted for carers of people with dementia. The use of Web-based services available for carers could help them and improve the health care system in the long term. In Greece and Cyprus,, there is a lack of services,, and improving the digital skills of carers could provide them with the means to support themselves at home and improve care provision.

29691215#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The internet offers major opportunities in supporting mental health care,, and a variety of technology-mediated mental and behavioral health services have been developed. Yet,, despite growing evidence for the effectiveness of these services,, their acceptance and use in clinical practice remains low. So far,, the current literature still lacks a structured insight into the experienced drivers and barriers to the adoption of electronic mental health (eMental health) from the perspective of clinical psychologists.
29691215#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the drivers and barriers for psychologists in adopting eMental health tools,, adding to previous work by also assessing drivers and analyzing relationships among these factors,, and subsequently by developing a structured representation of the obtained findings.
29691215#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study adopted a qualitative descriptive approach consisting of in-depth semistructured interviews with clinical psychologists working in the Netherlands (N=12). On the basis of the findings,, a model was constructed that was then examined through a communicative validation.
29691215#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In general,, a key driver for psychologists to adopt eMental health is the belief and experience that it can be beneficial to them or their clients. Perceived advantages that are novel to literature include the acceleration of the treatment process,, increased intimacy of the therapeutic relationship,, and new treatment possibilities due to eMental health. More importantly,, a relation was found between the extent to which psychologists have adopted eMental health and the particular drivers and barriers they experience. This differentiation is incorporated in the Levels of Adoption of eMental Health (LAMH) model that was developed during this study to provide a structured representation of the factors that influence the adoption of eMental health.

29691215#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The study identified both barriers and drivers,, several of which are new to the literature and found a relationship between the nature and importance of the various drivers and barriers perceived by psychologists and the extent to which they have adopted eMental health. These findings were structured in a conceptual model to further enhance the current understanding. The LAMH model facilitates further research on the process of adopting eMental health,, which will subsequently enable targeted recommendations with respect to technology,, training,, and clinical practice to ensure that mental health care professionals as well as their clients will benefit optimally from the current (and future) range of available eMental health options.

35147508#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The field of mobile health (mHealth) is constantly expanding. Integrating mHealth apps and devices in clinical practice is a major and complex challenge. General practitioners (GPs) are an essential link in a patient's care pathway. As they are patients' preferred health care intermediaries,, GPs play an important role in supporting patients' transition to mHealth.
35147508#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to identify the factors associated with the willingness of French GPs to prescribe mHealth apps and devices to their patients.
35147508#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#mHealth apps and devices were generally seen by GPs as useful in general medicine and were,, for the most part,, favorable to prescribing them. Their full integration in general medicine will be conditioned by the need for conclusive certification,, transparency (reliable and precise data concerning mHealth app and device methods of construction and clinical validation),, software aids to assist GPs prescribe them,, and dedicated training programs.

35147508#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study was part of the ApiAppS project whose overall objective was to help remove barriers GPs face when prescribing mHealth apps and devices by developing a custom-built platform to aid them. The study included GPs recruited from the general practice department of several medical faculties in France (Lyon,, Nice,, and Rouen) and mailing lists of academic GPs,, health care professional associations,, and social and professional networks. Participants were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire that collected data on various sociodemographic variables,, indicators of their involvement in continued education programs and the amount of time they dedicated to promoting healthy behaviors during patient consultations,, and indicators characterizing their patient population. Data on their perceptions of mHealth apps and devices were also collected. Finally,, the questionnaire included items to measure GPs' acceptability of prescribing mHealth apps and devices for several health-related dimensions.
35147508#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 174 GPs,, 129 (74.1%) declared their willingness to prescribe mHealth apps and devices to their patients. In multivariate analysis,, involvement in continued education programs (odds ratio [OR] 6.17,, 95% CI 1.52-28.72),, a better patient base command of the French language (OR 1.45,, 95% CI 1.13-1.88),, GP-perceived benefits of mHealth apps and devices for both patients and their medical practice and GP-perceived drivers for mHealth apps and device implementation in their medical practice (OR 1.04,, 95% CI 1.01-1.07),, and validation of mHealth apps and devices through randomized clinical trials (OR 1.02,, 95% CI 1.00-1.04) were all associated with GPs' willingness to prescribe mHealth apps and devices. In contrast,, older GPs (OR 0.95,, 95% CI 0.91-0.98),, female GPs (OR 0.26,, 95% CI 0.09-0.69),, and those who perceived risks for the patient or their medical practice (OR 0.96,, 95% CI 0.94-0.99) were less inclined to prescribe mHealth apps and devices.

34554098#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#eHealth literacy (EHL) refers to a variety of capabilities that enable individuals to obtain health information from electronic resources and apply it to solve health problems. With the digitization of health care and the wide availability of health apps,, a more diverse range of eHealth skills is required to properly use such health facilities. Existing EHL measurements focus mainly on the skill of obtaining health information (Web 1.0),, whereas skills for web-based interactions (Web 2.0) and self-managing health data and applying information (Web 3.0) have not been well measured.

34554098#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to develop an EHL scale (eHLS) termed eHLS-Web3.0 comprising a comprehensive spectrum of Web 1.0,, 2.0,, and 3.0 skills to measure EHL,, and evaluate its validity and reliability along with the measurement invariance among college students.
34554098#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In study 1,, 421 Chinese college students (mean age 20.5,, SD 1.4 years; 51.8% female) and 8 health experts (mean age 38.3,, SD 5.9 years; 87.5% female) were involved to develop the eHLS-Web3.0. The scale development included three steps: item pool generation,, content validation,, and exploratory factor analysis. In study 2,, 741 college students (mean age 21.3,, SD 1.4 years; 52.2% female) were recruited from 4 Chinese cities to validate the newly developed eHLS-Web3.0. The construct validity,, convergent validity,, concurrent validity,, internal consistency reliability,, test-retest reliability,, and measurement invariance across genders,, majors,, and regions were examined by a series of statistical analyses,, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup CFAs using SPSS and Mplus software packages.
34554098#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=3.701,, comparative fit index=0.924,, Tucker-Lewis index=0.914,, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06,, and standardized root mean residual [SRMR]=0.051). The average variance extracted (AVE) value of 0.58 and high correlation between eHLS-Web3.0 subscales and the eHealth Literacy Scale (r=0.725-0.880,, P<.001) indicated the convergent validity and concurrent validity of the eHLS-Web3.0. The results also indicated satisfactory internal consistency reliability (a=.976,, ?=0.934-0.956) and test-retest reliability (r=0.858,, P<.001) of the scale. Multigroup CFA demonstrated the 24-item eHLS-Web3.0 to be invariant at all configural,, metric,, strength,, and structural levels across genders (female and male),, majors (sport-related,, medical,, and general),, and regions (Yinchuan,, Kunming,, Xiamen,, and Beijing).
34554098#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The 24-item 3D eHLS-Web3.0 proved to be a reliable and valid measurement tool for EHL in the Web 3.0 context among Chinese college students.

29925492#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The objectives of South Africa's electronic health (eHealth) strategy recognize the value proposition that telemedicine practices hold for rural and urban referrals,, but a lack of accepted and formalized scale-up has impeded realization of benefits. While both synchronous and asynchronous teledermatology exist,, these remain localized and not scaled-up. Skin pathology is often the first sign of an HIV/AIDS infection,, which remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa. It is essential to replace the current inefficient dermatology referral process with a swift,, organized,, and efficacious one.
29925492#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to present an evidenced-based teledermatology scale-up framework (TDSF) and implementation roadmap (TDSF-IR).
29925492#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A qualitative method with a design science research process model was used which consisted of 5 phases: (1) Awareness,, which confirmed the need for an evidence-based TDSF and supporting TDSF-IR; (2) Suggestion,, where a proposal was delivered on how to develop a TDSF and TDSF-IR; (3) Development,, where we identified recommended design requirements and used these to identify and critique existing teledermatology or related scale-up frameworks; (4) Evaluation and validation,, where we assessed outputs of the development phase against the design requirements and validated by confirming the veracity of the TDSF and TDSF-IR (validation involved 4 key senior teledermatology stakeholders using a questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale); and (5) Conclusion,, where validation results were used to finalize and communicate the TDSF and TDSF-IR to users.
29925492#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The study identified 5 TDSF components: eHealth building blocks,, eHealth strategic objectives and budget,, scale-up continuum periods,, scale-up drivers,, and scale-up phases. In addition,, 36 subcomponents were identified. Each was further characterized and described to enable design of the final evidence-based TDSF. An implementation roadmap (TDSF-IR) was also prepared as a guide for an implementer with step-by-step instructions for application of the TDSF. For the validation study of the TDSF and supporting TDSF-IR,, 4 purposively selected key senior teledermatology management stakeholders were asked if they found it useful as a guide to assist the South African public health system with teledermatology scale-up. The mean (SD) of Likert-scale rating was 4.0 (0.53) where 4=Agree and 33 of 36 responses were either agree or strongly agree.
29925492#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study developed a TDSF and supporting roadmap (TDSF-IR) that are evidence-based. The proposed approach and described tools could be adapted to assist with ensuring scale-up and sustainability for other eHealth practices in other locations.

34613400#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#While the professional version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) has already been translated,, and validated into the Spanish language,, its user-centered counterpart has not yet been adapted. Furthermore,, no other similar tools exist in the Spanish language. The aim of this paper is to adapt and validate User Version of the MARS (uMARS) into the Spanish language.
34613400#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#Cross-cultural adaptation,, translation,, and metric evaluation. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Spanish version of the uMARS were evaluated using the RadarCovid app. Two hundred and sixteen participants rated the app using the translated scale. The app was then rated again 2 weeks later by 21 of these participants to measure test-retest reliability.
34613400#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#No major differences were observed between the uMARS original and the Spanish version. Discrimination indices (item-scale correlation) obtained appropriate results for both raters. The Spanish uMARS presented with excellent internal consistency,, a?=?.89 and .67 for objective and subjective quality,, respectively,, and temporal stability (r?>?0.82 for all items and subscales).
34613400#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The Spanish uMARS is a useful tool for health professionals to recommend high-quality mobile apps to their patients based on the user's perspective and for researchers and app developers to use end-user feedback and evaluation,, to help them identify highly appraised and valued components,, as well as areas for further development,, to continue ensuring the increasing quality and prominence of the area of mHealth.

36194450#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Neglecting adolescents' sexual and reproductive health (SRH) can affect multiple domains of development. Promoting healthy adolescent SRH is increasingly done using mobile phone apps. Providing SRH information via mobile phones can positively influence SRH outcomes including improving knowledge,, reducing sexual risk behavior,, and increasing the use of health services. A systematic approach to establishing and evaluating the quality of adolescent SRH mobile apps is urgently needed to rigorously evaluate whether they are a viable and effective strategy for reaching adolescents and improving adolescent SRH knowledge and behaviors in particular.
36194450#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to conduct an environmental scan to produce an inventory of adolescent SRH-specific mobile apps with descriptions of their purpose,, structure,, operations,, and quality of evidence.
36194450#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used a literature review to develop 15 search terms for adolescent SRH-related apps in the Canadian and US Apple and Google app stores. After generating the search results,, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Using the remaining apps,, we built an evidence table of app information,, and app reviewers assessed each included app using the Mobile App Rating Scale. App assessments were then used to highlight trends between apps and identify gaps in app quality.

36194450#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 2761 apps were identified by our searches,, of which 1515 were duplicates. Of the 1246 remaining apps,, 15 met the criteria for further assessment. Across all subdomains,, on a scale of 1-5,, the mean app score was 3.4/5. The Functionality subdomain had the highest mean score of 4.1/5,, whereas the Engagement subdomain had the lowest score of 2.9/5. The top 4 apps were Tia: Female Health Advisor (4.7/5),, Under the Stethoscope (4.2/5),, Condom Credit Card (4.1/5),, and Shnet (3.7/5).
36194450#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This environmental scan aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the mobile apps developed to promote adolescent SRH knowledge and outcomes. Of the 15 mobile apps available to provide information related to adolescent SRH,, few provided comprehensive,, reliable,, and evidence-based SRH information. Areas of strength included the apps' gestural design,, performance,, ease of use,, and navigation. Areas of weakness included app goals,, evidence base,, and app customization options. These results can be used to conduct future studies evaluating the use and efficacy of mobile apps on health knowledge and behaviors and promote adolescent SRH.

Although solutions to improve core operations were ranked as the most relevant currently,, a future shift to technologies beyond core laboratory expertise is expected. A key area of potential differentiation for laboratory customers was clinical decision support. Currently,, laboratories collaborate strongly with suppliers of laboratory integration software and information systems,, with high expectations for future collaboration in clinical decision support,, disease self-management,, and population health management. Asia Pacific countries attributed greater importance to adopting digital solutions than those in other regions. Financial burden was the most commonly cited challenge in implementing digital solutions.
33982076#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Specialists in laboratory medicine are proactively approaching digital innovations and transformation,, and there is high enthusiasm and expectation for further collaboration with suppliers and healthcare professionals beyond current core laboratory expertise.

34259644#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS),, a chronic systematic inflammatory disease,, require long-term treatment and management. Mobile health (mHealth) apps can deliver health services through mobile devices,, facilitate long-term disease management,, support patient-health care provider communication,, and enable patients to engage in disease management. There are some apps targeted at patients with AS,, but the feature and quality of these apps have not been systematically examined.
34259644#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to identify existing,, publicly available Chinese mHealth apps for AS management and to evaluate their features and quality.

35617014#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The visibility of erythematous plaques on the skin as well as the pain and itchiness caused by the skin lesions frequently leads to psychological distress in patients. Smartphone apps are widespread and easily accessible. Earlier studies have shown that apps can effectively complement current management strategies for patients with psoriasis. However,, no analysis of such apps has been published to date.
35617014#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to systematically identify and objectively assess the quality of current publicly available German apps for patients with psoriasis using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and compile brief ready-to-use app descriptions.

34259644#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We systematically searched potential apps for AS management on the Apple and Huawei App Stores,, using 4 search terms: ankylosing spondylitis,, spondyloarthritis,, rheumatic disease,, and arthritis. Apps were included if they were in the Chinese language,, targeted at patients with AS,, could be downloaded and run on Android and/or iOS operating systems,, and incorporated elements of disease management and/or patient education. We excluded apps that were not for patient use,, not relevant to AS,, or had not been updated since 2018. Apps that met the inclusion criteria were downloaded for final analysis. We formulated a list of app quality measures from and consistent with international guidelines for mHealth apps and AS management to evaluate the features and quality of the included app. The user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS) was also used to rate the apps' quality.
34259644#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 354 apps screened,, 5 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. All apps were free,, and most apps (4/5,, 80%) had a privacy policy. Of the 5 apps,, 1 (20%) involved medical professionals in the development process,, 2 (40%) were developed by companies,, and 2 (40%) were developed by medical institutions. All apps provided educational information about AS. Around half of the apps had functions like a basic information record (ie,, users can input gender,, age,, disease history,, etc) (n=3,, 60%),, patient-health care provider (and patient-patient) communication (n=2,, 40%),, symptom tracking (n=2,, 40%),, and information sharing (n=3,, 60%). Only 1 (20%) app provided comprehensive functions that adhered to international guidelines for AS management and mHealth apps. The overall uMARS scores ranged from 2.7 to 4.2; only 1 app,, with an overall uMARS score of 4.2,, was considered as a high-quality app.
34259644#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Most apps lacked comprehensive functions for AS management. One high-quality app provided comprehensive functions to help patients manage their conditions. This study assessed and summarized the features and quality of the apps but did not evaluate their efficacy. Future studies should evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of these apps. International guidelines and regulations for the design,, development,, validation,, and implementation of mHealth apps are needed in the future. Meanwhile,, health care providers,, patients with AS,, and app developers should collaborate to develop high-quality,, evidence-based apps that take into account patients' needs and health care professionals' perspectives.

35617014#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a systematic search and assessment of German apps for patients with psoriasis available in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The identified apps were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 reviewers,, who independently rated them using the German MARS (MARS-G). The MARS-G includes 15 items from 4 different sections (engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, and information) to create an overall mean score for every app. Scores can range from 1 for the lowest-quality apps to 5 for the highest-quality apps. Apps were ranked according to their mean MARS-G rating,, and the highest-ranked app was evaluated independently by 2 patients with psoriasis using the user version of the MARS-G (uMARS-G). Furthermore,, app information,, including origin,, main function,, and technical aspects,, was compiled into a brief overview.
35617014#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, we were able to identify 95 unique apps for psoriasis,, of which 15 were available in both app stores. Of these apps,, 5 were not specifically intended for patients with psoriasis,, 1 was designed for clinical trials only,, and 1 was no longer available at the time the evaluation process began. Consequently,, the remaining 8 apps were included in the final evaluation. The mean MARS-G scores ranged from 3.51 to 4.18. The app with the highest mean MARS-G score was Psoriasis Helferin (4.18/5.00). When rated by patients,, however,, the app was rated lower in all subcategories,, resulting in a mean uMARS-G score of 3.48. Most apps had a commercial background and a focus on symptom tracking. However,, only a fraction of the apps assessed used validated instruments to measure the user's disease activity.
35617014#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#App quality was heterogeneous,, and only a minority of the identified apps were available in both app stores. When evaluated by patients,, app ratings were lower than when evaluated by health care professionals. This discrepancy highlights the importance of involving patients when developing and evaluating health-related apps as the factors that make an app appealing to users may differ between these 2 groups.

30925595#ABSTRACT##Oncology has experienced a massive growth in knowledge over the last years. However,, the growing amount of knowledge and data increases the complexity of clinical decisions and presents oncologists with new challenges. Currently,, oncology-specific IT solutions are being developed with the aim to improve survival of cancer patients.The complexity of treatment decisions in oncology has greatly increased due to introduction of novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutics. First "intelligent" systems that suggest therapies based on available data have been developed,, however,, these systems are not yet widely adopted and lack sufficient clinical validation.Increasing implementation of electronic health records enables structured collection and analysis of data from routine patient care. These real-world data are used for post marketing surveillance and can help to develop therapy guidelines. Currently it is being discussed if real world data can provide sufficient evidence for regulatory decisions.Broad availability of internet access and smartphones provides an opportunity to involve patients in surveillance and control of cancer treatments. Early reporting of symptoms and side effects is likely to improve treatment and compliance. In addition,, patient reported outcomes can be employed for data collection in clinical trials and for quality surveillance. First randomized trials suggest that collection of patient reported outcomes can improve symptoms and survival of cancer patients.

32162529#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES#Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the commonest reasons a community-dwelling person with dementia (PWD) transitions to a care facility. Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Dementia Caregiver Empowerment (BESI) is a system of body-worn and in-home sensors developed to provide continuous,, noninvasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring to detect early signs of agitation and its environmental triggers.
32162529#ABSTRACT#RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS#This mixed methods,, remote ethnographic study is explored in a 3-phase,, multiyear plan. In Phase 1,, we developed and refined the BESI system and completed usability studies. Validation of the system and the development of dyad-specific models of the relationship between agitation and the environment occurred in Phase 2.
32162529#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Phases 1 and 2 results facilitated targeted changes in BESI,, thus improving its overall usability for the final phase of the study,, when real-time notifications and interventions will be implemented.
32162529#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Our results show a valid relationship between the presence of dementia related agitation and environmental factors and that persons with dementia and their caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system like BESI.

37129947#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital health technological innovations from startup companies used in clinical practice can yield better health outcomes,, reduce health care costs,, and improve patients' experience. However,, the integration,, translation,, and adoption of these technologies into clinical practice are plagued with many challenges and are lagging. Furthermore,, explanations of the impediments to clinical translation are largely unknown and have not been systematically studied from the perspective of AI and digital health care startup founders and executives.
37129947#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper is to describe the barriers to integrating early-stage technologies in clinical practice and health care systems from the perspectives of digital health and health care AI founders and executives.
37129947#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A stakeholder focus group workshop was conducted with a sample of 10 early-stage digital health and health care AI founders and executives. Digital health,, health care AI,, digital health-focused venture capitalists,, and physician executives were represented. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach,, transcripts were organized,, queried,, and analyzed for thematic convergence.
37129947#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified the following four categories of barriers in the integration of early-stage digital health innovations into clinical practice and health care systems: (1) lack of knowledge of health system technology procurement protocols and best practices,, (2) demanding regulatory and validation requirements,, (3) challenges within the health system technology procurement process,, and (4) disadvantages of early-stage digital health companies compared to large technology conglomerates. Recommendations from the study participants were also synthesized to create a road map to mitigate the barriers to integrating early-stage or novel digital health technologies in clinical practice.
37129947#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Early-stage digital health and health care AI entrepreneurs identified numerous barriers to integrating digital health solutions into clinical practice. Mitigation initiatives should create opportunities for early-stage digital health technology companies and health care providers to interact,, develop relationships,, and use evidence-based research and best practices during health care technology procurement and evaluation processes.

31950891#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The density of information in digital health records offers new potential opportunities for automated prediction of cost-relevant outcomes.
31950891#ABSTRACT#AIMS#We investigated the extent to which routinely recorded data held in the electronic health record (EHR) predict priority service outcomes and whether natural language processing tools enhance the predictions. We evaluated three high priority outcomes: in-patient duration,, readmission following in-patient care and high service cost after first presentation.
31950891#ABSTRACT#METHOD#We used data obtained from a clinical database derived from the EHR of a large mental healthcare provider within the UK. We combined structured data with text-derived data relating to diagnosis statements,, medication and psychiatric symptomatology. Predictors of the three different clinical outcomes were modelled using logistic regression with performance evaluated against a validation set to derive areas under receiver operating characteristic curves.
31950891#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In validation samples,, the full models (using all available data) achieved areas under receiver operating characteristic curves between 0.59 and 0.85 (in-patient duration 0.63,, readmission 0.59,, high service use 0.85). Adding natural language processing-derived data to the models increased the variance explained across all clinical scenarios (observed increase in r2 = 12-46%).
31950891#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#EHR data offer the potential to improve routine clinical predictions by utilising previously inaccessible data. Of our scenarios,, prediction of high service use after initial presentation achieved the highest performance.

33948242#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Digital health is rapidly expanding due to surging healthcare costs,, deteriorating health outcomes,, and the growing prevalence and accessibility of mobile health (mHealth) and wearable technology. Data from Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs),, including mHealth and wearables,, can be transformed into digital biomarkers that act as indicators of health outcomes and can be used to diagnose and monitor a number of chronic diseases and conditions. There are many challenges faced by digital biomarker development,, including a lack of regulatory oversight,, limited funding opportunities,, general mistrust of sharing personal data,, and a shortage of open-source data and code. Further,, the process of transforming data into digital biomarkers is computationally expensive,, and standards and validation methods in digital biomarker research are lacking.
33948242#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In order to provide a collaborative,, standardized space for digital biomarker research and validation,, we present the first comprehensive,, open-source software platform for end-to-end digital biomarker development: The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP).
33948242#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Here,, we detail the general DBDP framework as well as three robust modules within the DBDP that have been developed for specific digital biomarker discovery use cases.
33948242#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The clear need for such a platform will accelerate the DBDP's adoption as the industry standard for digital biomarker development and will support its role as the epicenter of digital biomarker collaboration and exploration.

22917062#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of childhood mortality. The lack of physicians in rural areas of developing countries makes difficult their correct diagnosis and treatment. The staff of rural health facilities (health-care technicians) may not be qualified to distinguish respiratory diseases by auscultation. For this reason,, the goal of this project is the development of a tele-stethoscopy system that allows a physician to receive real-time cardio-respiratory sounds from a remote auscultation,, as well as video images showing where the technician is placing the stethoscope on the patient's body.
22917062#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The design,, development and initial validation of the real-time wireless tele-stethoscopy system are described in detail. The system was conceived from scratch as open-source,, low-cost and designed in such a way that many universities and small local companies in developing countries may manufacture it. Only free open-source software has been used in order to minimize manufacturing costs and look for alliances to support its improvement and adaptation. The microcontroller firmware code,, the computer software code and the PCB schematics are available for free download in a subversion repository hosted in SourceForge.

22917062#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A real-time wireless stethoscopy system was designed. The initial requirements were: 1) The system must send audio and video synchronously over IP networks,, not requiring an Internet connection; 2) It must preserve the quality of cardiorespiratory sounds,, allowing to adapt the binaural pieces and the chestpiece of standard stethoscopes,, and; 3) Cardiorespiratory sounds should be recordable at both sides of the communication. In order to verify the diagnostic capacity of the system,, a clinical validation with eight specialists has been designed. In a preliminary test,, twelve patients have been auscultated by all the physicians using the tele-stethoscopy system,, versus a local auscultation using traditional stethoscope. The system must allow listen the cardiac (systolic and diastolic murmurs,, gallop sound,, arrhythmias) and respiratory (rhonchi,, rales and crepitations,, wheeze,, diminished and bronchial breath sounds,, pleural friction rub) sounds.
22917062#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#It has been shown that real-time tele-stethoscopy,, together with a videoconference system that allows a remote specialist to oversee the auscultation,, may be a very helpful tool in rural areas of developing countries.

36119746#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Multiple trials have demonstrated broad performance ranges for tests attempting to detect coronary artery disease. The most common test,, SPECT,, requires capital-intensive equipment,, the use of radionuclides,, induction of stress,, and time off work and/or travel. Presented here are the development and clinical validation of an office-based machine learned algorithm to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease without radiation,, expensive equipment or induced patient stress.

36119746#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The IDENTIFY trial (NCT03864081) is a prospective,, multicenter,, non-randomized,, selectively blinded,, repository study to collect acquired signals paired with subject meta-data,, including outcomes,, from subjects with symptoms of coronary artery disease. Time synchronized orthogonal voltage gradient and photoplethysmographic signals were collected for 230 seconds from recumbent subjects at rest within seven days of either left heart catheterization or coronary computed tomography angiography. Following machine learning on a proportion of these data (N = 2,,522),, a final algorithm was selected,, along with a pre-specified cut point on the receiver operating characteristic curve for clinical validation. An unseen set of subject signals (N = 965) was used to validate the algorithm.
36119746#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#At the pre-specified cut point,, the sensitivity for detecting functionally significant coronary artery disease was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68-0.78),, and the specificity was 0.68 (0.62-0.74). There exists a point on the receiver operating characteristic curve at which the negative predictive value is the same as coronary computed tomographic angiography,, 0.99,, assuming a disease incidence of 0.04,, yielding sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.42. Selecting a point at which the positive predictive value is maximized,, 0.12,, yields sensitivity of 0.39 and specificity of 0.88.
36119746#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The performance of the machine learned algorithm presented here is comparable to common tertiary center testing for coronary artery disease. Employing multiple cut points on the receiver operating characteristic curve can yield the negative predictive value of coronary computed tomographic angiography and a positive predictive value approaching that of myocardial perfusion imaging. As such,, a system employing this algorithm may address the need for a non-invasive,, no radiation,, no stress,, front line test,, and hence offer significant advantages to the patient,, their physician,, and healthcare system.

30770976#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although the quality of online health information (OHI) for adult surgical conditions is well described,, the availability of quality OHI for pediatric surgical conditions,, and the comparison to that of adult surgical OHI,, remains undefined.
30770976#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Medical and lay terms for 15 pediatric and 15 adult surgical conditions were searched using Google in English. The Health on the Net Foundation,, a non-governmental OHI accreditation body,, designates approval for quality websites. We compared the role of patient population while controlling for disease incidence (pediatric vs. adult),, term complexity (medical vs. lay),, and order (earlier vs. later listing of websites) on availability of quality OHI among the first 100 websites for each term.

30770976#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Among the first 100 websites,, the adjusted mean number of quality websites was 11.80 for pediatric vs. 17.92 for adult medical search terms,, and 13.27 for pediatric vs. 18.20 for adult lay search terms (P?<?0.05 for all). Term complexity did not affect quality,, and earlier appearing results were more likely to be of high quality.
30770976#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Availability of quality pediatric surgical OHI lags behind that of adult surgical OHI,, even when controlling for disease incidence. These findings highlight the potential need for increased quality OHI in pediatric surgery.

31385343#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop enhanced prediction models to update the QUiPP App prototype,, a tool providing individualized risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB),, for use in women with symptoms of threatened preterm labor (TPTL),, incorporating risk factors,, transvaginal ultrasound assessment of cervical length (CL) and cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) test results.
31385343#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants were pregnant women between 23?+?0 and 34?+?6?weeks' gestation with symptoms of TPTL,, recruited as part of four prospective cohort studies carried out at 16 UK hospitals between October 2010 and October 2017. The training set comprised all women whose outcomes were known in May 2017 (n?=?1032). The validation set comprised women whose outcomes were gathered between June 2017 and March 2018 (n?=?506). Parametric survival models were developed for three combinations of predictors: risk factors plus qfFN test results alone,, risk factors plus CL alone,, and risk factors plus both qfFN and CL. The best models were selected using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. The estimated probability of sPTB <?30,, <?34 or <?37?weeks' gestation and within 1 or 2?weeks of testing was calculated and receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were created to demonstrate the diagnostic ability of the prediction models.
31385343#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Predictive statistics were similar between the training and the validation sets at most outcome time points and for each combination of predictors. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) demonstrated that all three algorithms had good accuracy for the prediction of sPTB at <?30,, <?34 and <?37?weeks' gestation and within 1 and 2?weeks' post-testing in the validation set,, particularly the model combining risk factors plus qfFN alone (AUC: 0.96 at <?30?weeks; 0.85 at <?34?weeks; 0.77 at <?37?weeks; 0.91 at <?1?week from testing; and 0.92 at <?2?weeks from testing).

36627569#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for mother and child. Interventions to address smoking and drinking before and during pregnancy have the potential to reduce early-life health inequalities. In the Smoke and Alcohol Free with EHealth and Rewards (SAFER) pilot study we aimed to evaluate the acceptability,, feasibility and effectiveness of a complex intervention supporting women in smoking and alcohol cessation before and during pregnancy.
36627569#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Thirty-nine women who smoked were included; no women who consumed alcohol were referred to the study. Unemployment (51%),, financial problems (36%) and a smoking partner (72%) were common. Thirteen women (33%) dropped out,, often due to other problems impeding smoking cessation or 'being too busy' to participate in the group sessions. Eleven women (28%) had quit smoking at the study's endpoint. The personal and positive approach was highly valued and biochemical validation was felt to be helpful.
36627569#ABSTRACT#TRIAL REGISTRATION#Netherlands Trial Register: NL7493. Date registered: 04/02/2019.
36627569#ABSTRACT#METHODS#From February 2019 till March 2021,, we piloted the SAFER pregnancy intervention among pregnant women and women planning pregnancy in South-West Netherlands in an uncontrolled before-after study. Participants were supported in smoking and alcohol cessation via up to six group sessions and an online platform. In addition,, biochemically validated cessation was rewarded with incentives (i.e. shopping vouchers) amounting up to 185 euros. We aimed to include 66 women. The primary outcome was smoking and/or alcohol cessation at 34-38 weeks of gestation (if pregnant) or after six group sessions (if not pregnant). Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Focus group interviews among those involved in the study were conducted at the end of the study to explore their experiences. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis.
36627569#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The SAFER pregnancy intervention seems appropriate for women in need of extra support for smoking cessation before and during pregnancy. Its impact on alcohol cessation could not be studied due to recruitment issues. Recruitment and prevention of early dropout need attention in further development of this intervention.

32965232#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#According to the study participants,, the use of mHealth in clinical photo and wound documentation provides numerous benefits such as time-saving and efficacy,, better patient safety and quality of care,, enhanced data security and validation,, and better accessibility. The clinical workflow may also improve when the app is a good fit,, resulting in better collaboration and transparency,, streamlined daily work,, clinician empowerment,, and improved quality of care. The findings included important factors that may contribute to or hinder adoption. Factors may be related to the material nature of the tool,, such as the perceived usefulness,, ease of use,, interoperability,, cost,, or security of the app,, or social aspects such as personal experience,, attitudes,, awareness,, or culture. Organizational and policy barriers include the available clinical practice infrastructure,, workload and resources,, the complexity of decision making,, training,, and ambiguity or lack of regulations. User engagement in the development and implementation process is a vital contributor to the successful adoption of mHealth apps.
32965232#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The promising potential of mHealth in clinical photo and wound documentation is clear and may enhance clinical workflow and quality of care; however,, the factors affecting adoption go beyond the technical features of the tool itself to embrace significant social and organizational elements. Technology providers,, clinicians,, and decision makers should work together to carefully address any barriers to improve adoption and harness the potential of these tools.

32012065#ABSTRACT#METHODS#NAP data of 2837 CR patients from a multicenter Cardiac Rehabilitation Decision Support System (CARDSS) Web-based program was used. Patients used a Web-based portal,, MyCARDSS,, to provide their data. CAT and CART were assessed based on their performances in shortening the NAP procedure and in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
32012065#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#With CAT and CART,, an overall reduction of 36% and 72% of NAP questionnaire length,, respectively,, was achieved,, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.765 and 0.817 for CAT,, 0.777 and 0.877 for classification trees,, and 0.743 and 0.40 for regression trees,, respectively.
32012065#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Both CAT and CART can be used to shorten the questionnaires of the NAP used within the field of CR. CART,, however,, showed the best performance,, with a twice as large overall decrease in the number of questionnaire items of the NAP compared to CAT and the highest sensitivity and specificity. To our knowledge,, our study is the first to assess the differences in performance between CAT and CART for shortening questionnaire lengths. Future research should consider administering varied assessments of patients over time to monitor their progress in multiple domains. For CR professionals,, CART integrated with MyCARDSS would provide a feedback loop that informs the rehabilitation progress of their patients by providing real-time patient measurements.
33682467#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This article analyzes the changes in downloads and activity of users of select popular mental health mobile applications (mHealth apps) during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
33682467#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond.
33682467#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity.
33682467#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Among the 16 apps,, 10 were meditational in nature,, 13 showed increased downloads,, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity.
33682467#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design,, usability and effective assessment,, and integration into current workflows.
33682467#ABSTRACT#APPLICATION#The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care,, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered,, easy to use,, evidence-based,, well-integrated with professional care,, and used sustainably.

25984916#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Smartphones are increasingly playing a role in healthcare and previous studies assessing medical applications (apps) have raised concerns about lack of expert involvement and low content accuracy. However,, there are no such studies in Urology. We reviewed Urology apps with the aim of assessing the level of participation of healthcare professionals (HCP) and scientific Urology associations in their development.
25984916#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#A systematic search was performed on PubMed,, Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store,, for Urology apps,, available in English. Apps were reviewed by three graders to determine the app's platform,, target customer,, developer,, app type,, app category,, price and the participation of a HCP or a scientific Urology association in the development.
25984916#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search yielded 372 apps,, of which 150 were specific for Urology. A fifth of all apps had no HCP involvement (20.7%) and only a third had been developed with a scientific Urology association (34.7%). The lowest percentage of HCP (13.4%) and urological association (1.9%) involvement was in apps designed for the general population. Furthermore,, there was no contribution from an Urology society in "Electronic Medical Record" nor in "Patient Information" apps. A limitation of the study is that only Android and iOS apps were reviewed.
25984916#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the increasing Mobile Health (mHealth) market,, this is the first study that demonstrates the lack of expert participation in the design of Urology apps,, particularly in apps designed for the general public. Until clear regulation is enforced,, the urological community should help regulate app development. Maintaining a register of certified apps or issuing an official scientific seal of approval could improve overall app quality. We propose that urologists become stakeholders in mHealth,, shaping future app design and promoting peer-review app validation.

27421338#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Urological mobile medical (mHealth) apps are gaining popularity with both clinicians and patients. mHealth is a rapidly evolving and heterogeneous field,, with some urology apps being downloaded over 10,,000 times and others not at all. The factors that contribute to medical app downloads have yet to be identified,, including the hypothetical influence of expert involvement in app development.
27421338#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of our study was to identify predictors of the number of urology app downloads.

27421338#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We reviewed urology apps available in the Google Play Store and collected publicly available data. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression evaluated the effect of publicly available app variables on the number of apps being downloaded.
27421338#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of 129 urology apps eligible for study,, only 2 (1.6%) had >10,,000 downloads,, with half having =100 downloads and 4 (3.1%) having none at all. Apps developed with expert urologist involvement (P=.003),, optional in-app purchases (P=.01),, higher user rating (P<.001),, and more user reviews (P<.001) were more likely to be installed. App cost was inversely related to the number of downloads (P<.001). Only data from the Google Play Store and the developers' websites,, but not other platforms,, were publicly available for analysis,, and the level and nature of expert involvement was not documented.
27421338#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The explicit participation of urologists in app development is likely to enhance its chances to have a higher number of downloads. This finding should help in the design of better apps and further promote urologist involvement in mHealth. Official certification processes are required to ensure app quality and user safety.

35493956#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) offers potential benefits to both patients and healthcare systems. Existing remote technologies to measure respiratory rates have limitations such as cost,, accessibility and reliability. Using smartphone sensors to measure respiratory rates may offer a potential solution to these issues.
35493956#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel mHealth smartphone application designed to measure respiratory rates using movement sensors.
35493956#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In Study 1,, 15 participants simultaneously measured their respiratory rates with the app and a Food and Drug Administration-cleared reference device. A novel reference analysis method to allow the app to be evaluated 'in the wild' was also developed. In Study 2,, 165 participants measured their respiratory rates using the app,, and these measures were compared to the novel reference. The usability of the app was also assessed in both studies.
35493956#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The app,, when compared to the Food and Drug Administration-cleared and novel references,, respectively,, showed a mean absolute error of 1.65 (SD??=??1.49) and 1.14 (1.44),, relative mean absolute error of 12.2 (9.23) and 9.5 (18.70) and bias of 0.81 (limits of agreement?=?-3.27 to 4.89) and 0.08 (-3.68 to 3.51). Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.700 and 0.885. Ninety-three percent of participants successfully operated the app on their first use.
35493956#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The accuracy and usability of the app demonstrated here in individuals with a normal respiratory rate range show promise for the use of mHealth solutions employing smartphone sensors to remotely monitor respiratory rates. Further research should validate the benefits that this technology may offer patients and healthcare systems.

31452516#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The eHealth Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ) provides a standardized method to measure attitudes of electronic health (eHealth) users toward eHealth. It has previously been validated in a population of eHealth users in the United Kingdom and consists of 2 parts and 5 subscales. Part 1 measures attitudes toward eHealth in general and consists of the subscales attitudes towards online health information (5 items) and attitudes towards sharing health experiences online (6 items). Part 2 measures the attitude toward a particular eHealth application and consists of the subscales confidence and identification (9 items),, information and presentation (8 items),, and understand and motivation (9 items).
31452516#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to translate and validate the eHIQ in a Dutch population of eHealth users.
31452516#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The original factor structure showed a bad fit in all 3 study samples. EFAs showed a good fit for a modified factor structure in the first study sample. This factor structure was subsequently tested in samples 2 and 3 and showed acceptable to good fits. Internal consistency,, test-retest reliability,, convergent validity,, and divergent validity were acceptable to good for both the original as the modified factor structure,, except for test-retest reliability of one of the original subscales and the 2 derivative subscales in the modified factor structure. The graded response model showed that some items underperformed in both the original and modified factor structure.
31452516#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Dutch version of the eHIQ (eHIQ-NL) shows a different factor structure compared with the original English version. Part 1 of the eHIQ-NL consists of 3 subscales: attitudes towards online health information (5 items),, comfort with sharing health experiences online (3 items),, and usefulness of sharing health experiences online (3 items). Part 2 of the eHIQ-NL consists of 3 subscales: motivation and confidence to act (10 items),, information and presentation (13 items),, and identification (3 items).

The validation comprised 3 study samples,, with a total of 1287 participants. Structural validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs; all 3 samples). Internal consistency was assessed using hierarchical omega (all 3 samples). Test-retest reliability was assessed after 2 weeks,, using 2-way intraclass correlation coefficients (sample 1). Measurement error was assessed by calculating the smallest detectable change (sample 1). Convergent and divergent validity were assessed using correlations with the remaining measures (all 3 samples). A graded response model was fit,, and item information curves were plotted to describe the information provided by items across item trait levels (all 3 samples).

32167476#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parents often use digital media to search for information related to their children's health. As the quantity and quality of digital sources meant specifically for parents expand,, parents' digital health literacy is increasingly important to process the information they retrieve. One of the earliest developed and widely used instruments to assess digital health literacy is the self-reported eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). However,, the eHEALS has not been psychometrically validated in a sample of parents. Given the inconsistency of the eHEALS underlying factor structure across previous reports,, it is particularly important for validation to occur.
32167476#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to determine the factor structure of the German eHEALS measure in a sample of parents by adopting classic and modern psychometric approaches. In particular,, this study sought to identify the eHEALS validity as a unidimensional index as well as the viability for potential subscales.
32167476#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional design was used across two purposive sampling frames: online and paper administrations. Responses were collected between January 2018 and May 2018 from 703 Swiss-German parents. In addition to determining the sampling characteristics,, we conducted exploratory factor analysis of the eHEALS by considering its ordinal structure using polychoric correlations. This analysis was performed separately for online-based and paper-based responses to examine the general factor strength of the eHEALS as a unidimensional index. Furthermore,, item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted by fitting eHEALS to a bifactor model to further inspect its unidimensionality and subscale viability.
36945123#MESH##Parents
32167476#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Parents in both samples were predominantly mothers (622/703,, 88.5%),, highly educated (538/703,, 76.9%),, of Swiss nationality (489/703,, 71.8%),, and living with a partner (692/703,, 98.4%). Factor analyses of the eHEALS indicated the presence of a strong general factor across both paper and online samples,, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that the eHEALS total sum score was not significantly different between the paper and online samples (P=.12). Finally,, the IRT analyses indicated negligible multidimensionality,, insufficient subscale reliability after accounting for the eHEALS general factor,, and a reduced subset of items that could serve as a unidimensional index of the eHEALS across the paper and online samples.
32167476#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The German eHEALS evidenced good psychometric properties in a parent-specific study sample. Factor analyses indicated a strong general factor across purposively distinct sample frames (online and paper). IRT analyses validated the eHEALS as a unidimensional index while failing to find support for subscale usage.

36945123#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parents of children with cancer must learn and retain crucial information necessary to provide safe care for their child. Smartphone applications (apps) provide a significant opportunity to meet the informational needs of these parents. We aimed to develop,, refine,, and evaluate a smartphone app,, informed by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) expert consensus recommendations,, to support the informational needs of parents of children with cancer.
36945123#ABSTRACT#PROCEDURE#We employed a user-centered iterative mixed-methods approach in two phases (prototype development/refinement and pilot testing). We engaged parents and clinicians in evaluating the app via qualitative interviews and standardized tools that measured app quality (Mobile Application Rating Scale [MARS]),, usability (System Usability Scale [SUS]),, and acceptability (System Acceptability Scale [SAS]). We evaluated early usage patterns after public release.
36945123#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Thirty-two parents and 17 clinicians participated. Mean (± standard deviation [SD]) scores for app quality,, usability,, and acceptability were: MARS: 4.5 ± 0.7 on a 5-point scale; SUS: 86.7 ± 23.8 on a 100-point scale; and SAS: superior (61%); similar (28%); inferior (11%) to written materials. Qualitative findings largely confirmed the quantitative data. Downloads of the app during the first year following public release have exceeded 5000.
36945123#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The COG KidsCare app prototype was found to be of high quality and received high usability and acceptability ratings. Further testing is needed to determine app effectiveness in improving parental knowledge regarding care of children with cancer.

27919384#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics should be revised and updated to provide guidance for HIPs who are engaged in eHealth and related methods of health care delivery,, and to provide a model for a corresponding up-to-date revision of the ethical guidelines that are promulgated by IMIA's member organizations. Similar steps should be taken in the corporate sector so that the ethical rules that govern the working environment of HIPs in the eHealth setting will not pose ethical and professional problems. A possible solution in terms of accreditation and certification is outlined.

35552487#ABSTRACT##While fundamental aspects of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis were discussed in part 1 of this review,, the present work (part 2) provides a review of recent studies on the practical application of this new technology. The number of published articles on the topic of AI-based ECG analysis has been increasing rapidly since 2017. This is especially true for studies that use deep learning (DL) with artificial neural networks. The aim is not only to overcome the weaknesses of classical ECG diagnostics,, but also to extend the functionality of the ECG. This involves the detection of cardiological and noncardiological diseases and the prediction for clinical events,, e.g.,, the future development of left ventricular dysfunction and future clinical manifestation of atrial fibrillation. This is made possible by AI using DL to find subclinical patterns in giant ECG datasets and using them for algorithm development. AI-assisted ECG analysis is becoming a screening tool; it goes far beyond just being "better" than a cardiologist. The progress that has been made is remarkable and is generating much attention and also euphoria among experts and the public. However,, most studies are proof-of-concept studies. Often,, private (institution-owned) data are used,, the quality of which is unclear. To date,, clinical validation of the developed algorithms in other collectives and scenarios has been rare. Particularly problematic is that the way AI finds a solution so far mostly remains hidden from humans (black-box character of AI). Overall,, AI-based electrocardiography is still in its infancy. However,, it is already foreseeable that the ECG,, as a diagnostic procedure that is easy to use and can be repeated as often as desired,, will not only continue to be indispensable in the future,, but will also gain in clinical importance.

35395027#ABSTRACT##eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is the most widely used,, valid and reliable tool to assess eHealth literacy skills,, but no culturally appropriate tool exists to assess these skills among Sinhala-speaking Sri Lankans,, including health professionals. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the original eHEALS from English to Sinhala and evaluate its psychometric properties. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase involved translation and cross-cultural validation of the questionnaire. The second phase involved a cross-sectional survey conducted online among 268 health science students from a state university in Sri Lanka to confirm the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. An analysis of test-retest reliability was conducted with a subset of 72 students. The pre-final version of Sinhala eHEALS (Si-eHEALS) was developed following the cross-cultural adaptation process. The mean score of Si-eHEALS was 28.51±4.87. A satisfactory level of internal consistency was achieved (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). The test-retest reliability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient -.776). Content validity index of Si-eHEALS was.97. The principal component analysis supported the unidimensionality of the scale,, explaining 61.2 variance. There was a significant positive association between Si-eHEALS score with academic year (rs = .146,, p = .017),, self-rated internet skills (rs = .122,, p = .046),, usefulness of internet in health decision making (rs = .212,, p < .001) and importance of ability to access health resources on the internet (rs = .230,, p < .001),, confirming concurrent validity. No significant difference based on gender (U = 5854,, p = .550) and degree program (X2(2) = 2.965,, p = .564) was found,, confirming discriminant validity. In line with many previous validation studies,, our study demonstrated good psychometric properties for Si-eHEALS. Si-eHEALS is a valid and reliable tool that assesses eHealth literacy in Sinhala speaking Sri Lankans,, particularly health professionals.

27919384#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Privacy and other informatic patient rights in the context of traditional health care are identified and the role that HIPs play in this connection is analysed and distinguished from the role HIPs play in eHealth in order to determine whether the 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics provides sufficient guidance for HIPs in eHealth and associated settings. The position of inter-jurisdictional corporate eHealth providers is also touched upon.
27919384#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#It is found that in eHealth,, mHealth and pHealth the ethical and legal position of HIPs differs importantly from that in traditional technologically-assisted health care because HIPs have fiduciary obligations they did not have before. It is also found that the 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics,, which provides the framework for the codes of ethics that are promulgated by its various member organizations,, provides insufficient guidance for dealing with issues that arise in this connection because they do not acknowledge this important change. It is also found that interjurisdictional eHealth etc. raises new ethical and legal issues for the corporate sector that transcend contractual arrangements.

34398962#ABSTRACT##Increased moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with better health outcomes in breast cancer survivors; yet,, most are insufficiently active. Smartphone applications (apps) to promote MVPA have high scalability potential,, but few evidence-based apps exist. The purpose is to describe the testing and usability of Fit2Thrive,, a MVPA promotion app for breast cancer survivors. A user-centered,, iterative design process was utilized on three independent groups of participants. Two groups of breast cancer survivors (group 1 n = 8; group 2: n = 14) performed app usability field testing by interacting with the app for =3 days in a free-living environment. App refinements occurred following each field test. The Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) and the User Version Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS) assessed app usability and quality on a 7- and 5-point scale,, respectively,, and women provided qualitative written feedback. A third group (n = 15) rated potential app notification content. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed using a directed content analysis. The PSSUQ app usability score (M1= 3.8; SD = 1.4 vs. M2= 3.2; SD = 1.1; lower scores are better) and uMARS app quality score (M1 = 3.4; SD = 1.3 vs. M2= 3.4; SD = 0.6; higher scores are better) appeared to improve in Field Test 2. Group 1 participants identified app "clunkiness,," whereas group 2 participants identified issues with error messaging/functionality. Group 3 "liked" 53% of the self-monitoring,, 71% of the entry reminder,, 60% of the motivational,, and 70% of the goal accomplishment notifications. Breast cancer survivors indicated that the Fit2Thrive app was acceptable and participants were able to use the app. Future work will test the efficacy of this app to increase MVPA.

27919384#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Issues such as privacy,, security,, quality,, etc. have received considerable attention in discussions of eHealth,, mHealth and pHealth. However,, comparatively little attention has been paid to the fact that these methods of delivering health care situate Health Information Professionals (HIPs) in an ethical context that is importantly different from that of traditional health care because they assign a fiduciary role to HIPs that they did not have before,, their previous technical involvement notwithstanding. Even less attention has been paid to the fact that when these methods of health care delivery are interjurisdictional,, they situate HIPs in an ethical fabric that does not exist in the intra-jurisdictional setting.

26262290#ABSTRACT##The Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) is a public telehealth service in Brazil that assists 722 municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais. As a large-scale teleconsultation service,, it was important to implement clinical quality control to guarantee the quality of the service. Our aim is to describe the audit of the teleconsultation responses performed by TNMG. A random sample was selected from teleconsultations performed by the specialists from the TNMG between January and February 2014. The responses were evaluated regarding size,, objectivity,, quality,, ethics,, courtesy and grammar. A total of 640 teleconsultation responses were assessed,, and the mean scores were =2.45. Objectivity and quality had the lowest scores in the different specialities. The methodology was useful for evaluating the teleconsultation service and for identifying the areas to improve.

33381892#ABSTRACT#AIM#mHealth can facilitate comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in countries with limited geriatric healthcare facilities. It can compensate for the lack of trained geriatricians and integrate CGA in different healthcare disciplines leading to better clinical outcomes. This study assessed the usability of a self-administered geriatric assessment smartphone application.
33381892#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional study included participants from the geriatric clinic at Ain Shams University Hospital,, Cairo,, Egypt. This study was performed in three phases: development and validation of an abbreviated geriatric assessment tool,, and validation of the application prototype. Twenty subjects were recruited for pretesting the abbreviated assessment tool,, then another 50 patients to validate this tool in a face-to-face interview. Afterwards,, another 12 patients completed the prototype followed by a standardized office visit interview. Each assessment domain was evaluated in agreement with a valid reference test during the clinical interview.
33381892#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The application was simple and user friendly. The scores of each domain correlated to the reference test scores (rho = 0.59-0.93). Most of the domains exhibited good agreement with the reference tests (kappa = 0.68-1.00) (except for frailty and nutritional assessment).
33381892#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The mHealth geriatric assessment is possible and highly desirable during physical distancing and beyond. Obviously,, this approach cannot substitute for clinical examination and multidisciplinary standard CGA. However,, it may overcome some barriers facing the geriatrization of medicine. It would help general practitioners to provide pre-CGA evaluation,, particularly in areas with limited access to formal geriatric healthcare services. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2021; 21: 222-228.

35641060#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Given the absence of guidelines for use of virtual visits for primary care delivery,, a framework is needed to inform the most appropriate use of virtual visits.
35641060#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted in-depth,, structured interviews of 18 patients,, primary care clinicians,, and other select informants. They were asked to discuss optimal,, acceptable,, and suboptimal uses of telemedicine for delivering care relative to in-person care delivery. The concepts expressed informed our development of a framework about appropriate use of virtual visits.
35641060#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The 103 concepts supported 5 main themes that emerged as a framework: clinical situations which are optimal for in-person care; situations optimal for virtual visits; situations that might be exchangeable between sites; contextual factors favoring in-person care; and contextual factors favoring virtual visits.
35641060#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#After further validation,, we expect that this framework may guide future research and practice: it may be valuable for clinical practice redesign,, for designing evaluations of the outcomes of virtual visits,, for outcomes research,, for patient education,, for triage,, and possibly for reimbursement considerations.

28646889#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of commercial apps to improve health behaviours in children is growing rapidly. While this provides opportunities for promoting health,, the content and quality of apps targeting children and adolescents is largely unexplored. This review systematically evaluated the content and quality of apps to improve diet,, physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents,, and examined relationships of app quality ratings with number of app features and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used.
28646889#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Systematic literature searches were conducted in iTunes and Google Play stores between May-November 2016. Apps were included if they targeted children or adolescents,, focused on improving diet,, physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour,, had a user rating of at least 4+ based on at least 20 ratings,, and were available in English. App inclusion,, downloading and user-testing for quality assessment and content analysis were conducted independently by two reviewers. Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between app quality,, and number of technical app features and BCTs included.
28646889#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Twenty-five apps were included targeting diet (n = 12),, physical activity (n = 18) and sedentary behaviour (n = 7). On a 5-point Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),, overall app quality was moderate (total MARS score: 3.6). Functionality was the highest scoring domain (mean: 4.1,, SD: 0.6),, followed by aesthetics (mean: 3.8,, SD: 0.8),, and lower scoring for engagement (mean: 3.6,, SD: 0.7) and information quality (mean: 2.8,, SD: 0.8). On average,, 6 BCTs were identified per app (range: 1-14); the most frequently used BCTs were providing 'instructions' (n = 19),, 'general encouragement' (n = 18),, 'contingent rewards' (n = 17),, and 'feedback on performance' (n = 13). App quality ratings correlated positively with numbers of technical app features (rho = 0.42,, p < 0.05) and BCTs included (rho = 0.54,, p < 0.01).
28646889#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Popular commercial apps to improve diet,, physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents had moderate quality overall,, scored higher in terms of functionality. Most apps incorporated some BCTs and higher quality apps included more app features and BCTs. Future app development should identify factors that promote users' app engagement,, be tailored to specific population groups,, and be informed by health behaviour theories.

26250503#ABSTRACT##Emerging digital technologies offer enormous potential to improve quality,, reduce cost,, and increase patient-centeredness in healthcare. Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) play a key role in advancing medical care through cutting-edge medical research,, yet traditional models for invention,, validation and commercialization at AMCs have been designed around biomedical initiatives,, and are less well suited for new digital health technologies. Recently,, two large bi-coastal Academic Medical Centers,, the University of California,, San Francisco (UCSF) through the Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI) and Partners Healthcare through the Center for Connected Health (CCH) have launched centers focused on digital health innovation. These centers show great promise but are also subject to significant financial,, organizational,, and visionary challenges. We explore these AMC initiatives,, which share the following characteristics: a focus on academic research methodology; integration of digital technology in educational programming; evolving models to support "clinician innovators"; strategic academic-industry collaboration and emergence of novel revenue models.

31306439#ABSTRACT##Relative to the large investments in mobile health (mHealth) strategies for mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression,, the development of technology to facilitate illness self-management for people with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses is limited. This situation falls out of step with the opportunity mHealth represents for providing inexpensive and accessible self-care resources and the routine use of mobile technologies by people with schizophrenia. Accordingly,, the focus of this study was upon the feasibility of a schizophrenia-focused mobile application: App4Independence (A4i). A4i is a multi-feature app that uses feed,, scheduling,, and text-based functions co-designed with service users to enhance illness self-management. This study was completed in a large urban Canadian centre and employed pre-post assessments over a 1-month period that examined medication adherence,, personal recovery,, and psychiatric symptomatology. App use metrics were assessed as was qualitative feedback through semi-structured interview. Findings are reported in line with the World Health Organization mHealth Evidence and Assessment (mERA) checklist. Among the 38 individuals with a primary psychosis who participated,, there was no research attrition and classic retention on the app was 52.5%. Significant improvement was observed in some psychiatric symptom domains with small-medium effects. Significant change in recovery engagement and medication adherence were not observed after controlling for multiple comparisons. Those who interacted with the app more frequently were more depressed and had higher hostility and interpersonal sensitivity at baseline. Satisfaction with the app was high and qualitative feedback provided insights regarding feature enhancements. This research suggested that A4i is feasible in terms of outcome and process indicators and is a technology that is ready to move on to clinical trial and validation testing. This study contributes to the small but emergent body of work investigating digital health approaches in severe mental illness populations.

35457610#ABSTRACT##There is much discussion about the skills of people in understanding and managing online health information. The Italian survey “SEI Donna” aimed to investigate perceptions and use of the web in women regarding health issues considering their health literacy (HL) and healthcare skills. We used an online questionnaire to explore different aspects of online health-related information-seeking behavior. The study participants (n = 7027) were categorized into healthcare workers (HW),, healthcare students (HS),, and non-healthcare women (non-HW). Half the sample (52%) searched online for a second opinion after the medical examination without statistical difference among HW,, HS,, and non-HW. Women in the age range of 26-40 years (OR = 1.28,, p < 0.001),, having chronic illness (OR = 1.48; p < 0.001),, and being moderately (OR = 1.58; p < 0.001) or not satisfied (OR = 2.04; p < 0.001) with healthcare professionals were more likely to use the Internet to seek medical insight. Overall,, 34% of women had a functional HL,, the same being higher in HW (64%) and in HS (43%) than the rest of the women (18%) (p < 0.0001). The suboptimal HL suggests the need to improve HL in the general population to be skilled in surfing the web and,, at the same time,, to reorganize health training to improve the HL of healthcare professionals,, also enriching their communication skills.

34654432#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An iterative and reflective process was adopted,, supported by existing literature and research including consultations with eHealth experts,, and guidance from existing frameworks. These collectively identified key elements,, concepts,, and standards relevant and essential for framework design and development.
34654432#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) was developed which highlights the need for: governance and regulation of mHealth and eRecord systems,, a national health information exchange,, and which interoperability levels to achieve. Each of these are supported by integral themes and concepts. It also addresses the need for regular review,, accreditation,, and alignment of framework concepts and themes with a National eHealth Strategy Interoperability Development Process. To demonstrate the framework's applicability,, a proposed architecture for the Kgonafalo mobile telemedicine programme is presented.

34654432#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The proliferation of mHealth solutions and eRecord systems is inevitable in developing countries,, and ensuring their bi-directional interoperability is essential. Interoperability has been described as the ability for two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. Given the importance of linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in the developing world,, a suitable interoperability framework is required to provide an agreed approach to interoperability and specify common elements. Although eHealth interoperability frameworks exist in the literature,, none meet all the requirements for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in developing countries. The aim of this paper was to describe the design and development of a conceptual framework for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana,, as an exemplar.
35803062#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There were surges in the demand for telehealth and home care in the COVID-19 pandemic. A new home ECG testing model was developed and used in the real-world clinical practice.
35803062#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Since June 2020,, QT Medical,, Inc. (Diamond Bard,, California) has been providing home ECG testing service by mail. Upon receiving the order from a clinician,, an ECG testing kit was sent to the patient by mail. The kit included an ECG recorder,, a prepositioned electrode strip of proper size for the patient (determined by the ordering clinician),, printed instructions for performing the test,, and a return envelope. We reviewed and analyzed the de-identified administrative dataset of the first 1000 ECG tests ordered by 37 medical practices.
35803062#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 1000 patients served by this mail delivery home ECG testing service,, 77.3% were female and 22.7% were male. Their ages ranged from 1 year old to 96 years old,, mean 49.5 ± 13.4 years (median 52). 92.9% patients completed their tests with clinical quality ECGs uploaded to their ordering clinician's online accounts. Of those who did not complete the tests,, the main reason was they "no longer needed the test". Failure to complete the test due to technical issues was 1.4%. Only one patient had to repeat the test due to inadequate ECG quality as judged by the ordering physician. The median turnaround time,, from the kit being mailed out to the recorder being returned,, was 10 days. Overall,, 2.2% of the ECG devices were lost in shipping or unreturned by patients.
35803062#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Of the first 1000 patients who had their ECG tests at homes,, it was found that this home ECG testing platform and care model could be reliably used by patients with no training to acquire clinical grade ECG. The current study proved that medical standard,, resting 12-lead ECG can be performed by the majority of patients at home.

36197717#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Gastrointestinal diseases are associated with substantial cost in health care. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic and further digitalization of gastrointestinal tract health care,, mobile health apps could complement routine health care. Many gastrointestinal health care apps are already available in the app stores,, but the quality,, data protection,, and reliability often remain unclear.
36197717#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review aimed to evaluate the quality characteristics as well as the privacy and security measures of mobile health apps for the management of gastrointestinal diseases.
36197717#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A web crawler systematically searched for mobile health apps with a focus on gastrointestinal diseases. The identified mobile health apps were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Furthermore,, app characteristics,, data protection,, and security measures were collected. Classic user star rating was correlated with overall mobile health app quality.
36197717#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The overall quality of the mobile health apps (N=109) was moderate (mean 2.90,, SD 0.52; on a scale ranging from 1 to 5). The quality of the subscales ranged from low (mean 1.89,, SD 0.66) to good (mean 4.08,, SD 0.57). The security of data transfer was ensured only by 11 (10.1%) mobile health apps. None of the mobile health apps had an evidence base. The user star rating did not correlate with the MARS overall score or with the individual subdimensions of the MARS (all P>.05).
36197717#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Mobile health apps might have a positive impact on diagnosis,, therapy,, and patient guidance in gastroenterology in the future. We conclude that,, to date,, data security and proof of efficacy are not yet given in currently available mobile health apps.

25980862#ABSTRACT##Depression is the most prevalent clinical disorder and one of the main causes of disability. This makes early detection of depressive symptoms critical in its prevention and management. This paper presents and discusses the development of Psychologist in a Pocket (PiaP),, a mental mHealth application for Android which screens and monitors for these symptoms,, and-given the explicit permission of the user-alerts a trusted contact such as the mental health professional or a close friend,, if it detects symptoms. All text inputted electronically-such as short message services,, emails,, social network posts-is analyzed based on keywords related to depression based on DSM-5 and ICD criteria as well as Beck's Cognitive Theory of Depression and the Self-Focus Model. Data evaluation and collection happen in the background,, on-device,, without requiring any user involvement. Currently,, the application is in an early prototype phase entering initial clinical validation.

35135963#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#This study systematically evaluated the quality and functionalities of patient-facing,, commercially available mobile health (mHealth) apps for cardiac rehabilitation (CR).
35135963#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed our search in two of the most widely used commercial mobile app stores: Apple iTunes Appstore and Google Play Store (Android apps). Six search terms were used to query relevant CR apps: "cardiac rehabilitation,," "heart disease and remote therapy,," "heart failure exercise,," "heart therapy and cardiac recovery,," "cardiac recovery,," and "heart therapy." App quality was evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). App functionality was evaluated using the IQVIA functionality scale,, and app content was evaluated against the American Heart Association guidelines for CR. Apps meeting our inclusion criteria were downloaded and evaluated by two to three reviewers,, and interclass correlations between reviewers were calculated.
35135963#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We reviewed 3121 apps and nine apps met our inclusion criteria. On average,, the apps scored a 3.0 on the MARS (5-point Likert scale) for overall quality. The two top-ranking mHealth apps for CR for all three quality,, functionality,, and consistency with evidence-based guidelines were My Cardiac Coach and Love My Heart for Women,, both of which scored =4.0 for behavior change.
35135963#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Overall,, the quality and functionality of free apps for mobile CR was high,, with two apps performing the best across all three quality categories. High-quality CR apps are available that can expand access to CR for patients with cardiovascular disease.

33787435#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#To investigate outcome measurement tools for the validation of teleaudiology hearing aid rehabilitation services for adults.
33787435#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search strategy was developed to identify tools used to evaluate standard and teleaudiology hearing aid rehabilitation services for adults. A seven-domain hearing-health-care service model for validation was defined and used to analyse the applicability and suitability of patient- and service-centred tools. This model and the applicability and suitability criteria were based on the literature,, the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) framework,, and gold standard professional practice guidelines,, which together formed the validation framework used in this study.
33787435#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Eighteen tools were identified and assessed against the validation framework. These tools were found to primarily assess aspects in the patient communication domain and rarely in the domain of service provision. All the included tools had some applicable items for teleaudiology hearing aid services; three tools were judged as suitable and four partially suitable for validating these services.

33787435#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Although there is a set of suitable tools available to validate teleaudiology hearing aid rehabilitation services,, none of them cover all the seven domains of the validation model used by this review and few are focussed on a specific domain. Further improvement and/or development of new tools to comprehensively validate these services is still necessary. At this stage,, this still limits clinical audiology practice research,, especially in teleaudiology.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOutcome measurement tools are crucial for assessing the validity of hearing rehabilitation services.Findings of this study inform clinicians and researchers on how and what to assess and use to evaluate teleaudiology and standard hearing aid rehabilitation services.The use of the proposed validation framework may facilitate the standardisation of validation of both face-to-face and remotely delivered audiology rehabilitation services and improve consistency of methodology and reported real-world outcomes across studies and thus,, the evidence.
36933116#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Inclusion of evidence-based behavior change techniques (e.g.,, self-monitoring) in mobile health apps has the potential to promote adherence to inflammatory bowel disease treatment. While inflammatory bowel disease management apps exist,, the extent to which they incorporate behavior change techniques remains unknown.
36933116#ABSTRACT#AIMS#The present study systematically evaluated the content and quality of free,, commercially available inflammatory bowel disease management apps.
36933116#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Apps were identified using a systematic search of the Apple App and Google Play stores. Apps were evaluated using Abraham and Michie's taxonomy of 26 behavior change techniques. A literature search was conducted to identify behavior change techniques specific and relevant for people with inflammatory bowel disease. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale with scores ranging from 1 (Inadequate) to 5 (Excellent).
36933116#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 51 inflammatory bowel disease management apps were evaluated. Apps included 0-16 behavior change techniques (Mean?=?4.55) and 0-10 inflammatory bowel disease management behavior change techniques (Mean?=?3.43). App quality ranged from 2.03 to 4.62 (Mean?=?3.39) out of 5.00. Two apps,, My IBD Care: Crohn's & Colitis and MyGiHealth GI Symptom Tracker,, included the highest number of overall and inflammatory bowel disease management behavior change techniques along with high-quality scores. Bezzy IBD was the only app with a high number of overall and inflammatory bowel disease management behavior change techniques with a primary focus on social support/change.
36933116#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Most inflammatory bowel disease management apps reviewed included evidence-based inflammatory bowel disease management behavior change techniques.

37079370#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although evidence supporting the feasibility of large-scale mobile health (mHealth) systems continues to grow,, privacy protection remains an important implementation challenge. The potential scale of publicly available mHealth applications and the sensitive nature of the data involved will inevitably attract unwanted attention from adversarial actors seeking to compromise user privacy. Although privacy-preserving technologies such as federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) offer strong theoretical guarantees,, it is not clear how such technologies actually perform under real-world conditions.
37079370#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Using data from the University of Michigan Intern Health Study (IHS),, we assessed the privacy protection capabilities of FL and DP against the trade-offs in the associated model's accuracy and training time. Using a simulated external attack on a target mHealth system,, we aimed to measure the effectiveness of such an attack under various levels of privacy protection on the target system and measure the costs to the target system's performance associated with the chosen levels of privacy protection.
37079370#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A neural network classifier that attempts to predict IHS participant daily mood ecological momentary assessment score from sensor data served as our target system. An external attacker attempted to identify participants whose average mood ecological momentary assessment score is lower than the global average. The attack followed techniques in the literature,, given the relevant assumptions about the abilities of the attacker. For measuring attack effectiveness,, we collected attack success metrics (area under the curve [AUC],, positive predictive value,, and sensitivity),, and for measuring privacy costs,, we calculated the target model training time and measured the model utility metrics. Both sets of metrics are reported under varying degrees of privacy protection on the target.
37079370#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# and a 43% increase in model training time. Attack positive predictive value and sensitivity followed similar trends. Finally,, we showed that participants in the IHS most likely to require strong privacy protection are also most at risk from this particular privacy attack and subsequently stand to benefit the most from these privacy-preserving technologies.
37079370#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our results demonstrated both the necessity of proactive privacy protection research and the feasibility of the current FL and DP methods implemented in a real mHealth scenario. Our simulation methods characterized the privacy-utility trade-off in our mHealth setup using highly interpretable metrics,, providing a framework for future research into privacy-preserving technologies in data-driven health and medical applications.

32419676#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop a module which could be used to facilitate the assessment of mobile medical applications (MMA) for regulatory and reimbursement purposes.
32419676#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In-depth interviews were conducted with policymakers,, healthcare practitioners,, and application developers to determine possible pathways and impediments to MMA reimbursement. These findings were integrated with our previous research on MMA reimbursement and regulation to create a module that could be used with existing health technology assessment (HTA) methodological frameworks to guide the evaluation of MMAs.
32419676#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Stakeholders indicated that they trust how traditional medical devices are currently appraised for reimbursement. They were concerned that there was a lack of clarity regarding which entity in the health system was responsible for determining app quality. They were also concerned about the digital health literacy of medical practitioners and patients. Concepts emerging from our previous research were reinforced by the interview findings,, including that the connectivity and cybersecurity of apps need to be considered,, along with an assessment of software reliability. It is also critical that the credibility of the information presented in apps is assessed as it could potentially mislead patients and clinicians.
32419676#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#An MMA evaluation module was created that would enable an existing HTA process to be adapted for the assessment of MMA technology. These adaptations include making provisions for an assessment of app cybersecurity,, the impact on MMA clinical utility of software updates,, and compatibility issues. Items to address concerns around practitioner responsibility and app misinformation were also incorporated into the module.

33104013#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Weight management apps may provide support and management options for individuals with overweight and obesity. Research on the quality of weight management mHealth apps among the Saudi population is insufficient despite frequent use.
33104013#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aims of this study were to explore user perceptions of weight management apps,, explore reasons for starting and stopping app use,, appraise the quality of weight management apps available in the App Store,, and compare the features currently available within the app market and those that are most desirable to weight management app users.
33104013#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A web-based survey consisted of 31 open and closed questions about sociodemographic information,, general health questions,, app use,, app user perceptions,, and discontinuation of app use. The quality of the weight management apps available on the App Store was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale and evidence-based strategies. We also used six sigma evaluations to ensure that the quality measured by the tools consistently meets customer expectations.
33104013#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Data from the survey were analyzed. Of the respondents,, 30.17% (324/1074) had used a weight management app,, 18.16% (195/1074) used the apps and stopped,, and 51.68% (555/1074) had never used a weight management app. Of apps mentioned,, 23 met the inclusion criteria. The overall average Mobile App Rating Scale quality of apps was acceptable; 30% (7/23) received a quality mean score of 4 or higher (out of 5),, and 30% (7/23) did not meet the acceptability score of 3 or higher. Evidence-based strategy results showed that feedback was not observed in any of the apps,, and motivation strategy was observed in only 1 app. The sigma results of evidence-based strategies reflect that most of the apps fail to pass the mean.
33104013#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#App users desired a feature that allows them to communicate with a specialist,, which is a missing in the available free apps. Despite the large number and accessibility of weight management apps,, the quality and features of most are variable. It can be concluded from six sigma results that passing the mean does not ensure that the quality is consistently distributed through all app quality properties and Mobile App Rating Scale and evidence-based strategies do not give developers an indication of the acceptance of their apps by mobile users. This finding stresses the importance of reevaluating the passing criterion,, which is =50% for designing an effective app.

35051900#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#To reduce complications associated with central venous catheter (CVC) insertions,, local accreditation programs using a supervised procedural logbook are essential. To increase compliance with such a logbook,, a mobile app could provide the ideal platform for training doctors in an adult intensive care unit (ICU).
35051900#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper was to compare trainee compliance with the completion of a logbook as part of a CVC insertion accreditation program,, before and after the introduction of an app-based logbook.
35051900#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This is a retrospective observational study of logbook data,, before and after the introduction of a purpose-built,, app-based,, electronic logbook to complement an existing paper-based logbook. Carried out over a 2-year period in the adult ICU of the John Hunter Hospital,, Newcastle,, NSW,, Australia,, the participants were ICU trainee medical officers completing a CVC insertion accreditation program. The primary outcome was the proportion of all CVC insertions documented in the patients' electronic medical records appearing as logbook entries. To assess logbook entry quality,, we measured and compared the proportion of logbook entries that were approved by a supervisor and contained a supervisor's signature for the before and after periods. We also analyzed trainee participation before and after the intervention by comparing the total number of active logbook users,, and the proportion of first-time users who logged 3 or more CVC insertions.
35051900#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 2987 CVC insertions documented in the electronic medical records between April 7,, 2019,, and April 6,, 2021,, 2161 (72%) were included and separated into cohorts before and after the app's introduction. Following the introduction of the app-based logbook,, the percentage of CVC insertions appearing as logbook entries increased from 3.6% (38/1059) to 20.5% (226/1102; P<.001). There was no difference in the proportion of supervisor-approved entries containing a supervisor's signature before and after the introduction of the app,, with 76.3% (29/38) and 83.2% (188/226),, respectively (P=.31). After the introduction of the app,, there was an increase in the percentage of active logbook users from 15.3% (13/85) to 62.8% (54/86; P<.001). Adherence to one's logbook was similar in both groups with 60% (6/10) of first-time users in the before group and 79.5% (31/39) in the after group going on to log at least 3 or more CVCs during their time working in ICU.
35051900#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The addition of an electronic app-based logbook to a preexisting paper-based logbook was associated with a higher rate of logbook compliance in trainee doctors undertaking an accreditation program for CVC insertion in an adult ICU. There was a large increase in logbook use observed without a reduction in the quality of logbook entries. The overall trainee participation also improved with an observed increase in active logbook users and no reduction in the average number of entries per user following the introduction of the app. Further studies on app-based logbooks for ICU procedural accreditation programs are warranted.

31098883#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#We adapted the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) for Hungary and tested its psychometric properties on a large representative online sample of the general population.
31098883#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Hungarian version of eHEALS was developed using forward-backward translation. For the valuation study,, 1000 respondents were recruited in early 2019 from a large online panel by a survey company. We tested internal consistency,, test-retest reliability and construct and criterion validity using classical test theory,, as well as item characteristics using an item-response theory (IRT) graded response model (GRM).
31098883#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#55% of respondents were female,, and 22.1% were = 65 years old. Mean eHEALS score was 29.2 (SD: 5.18). Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's a?=?0.90),, and test-retest reliability was moderate (intraclass correlation r?=?0.64). We identified a single-factor structure by exploratory factor analysis,, explaining 85% of test variance. Essential criteria for GRM analysis were met. Items 3 and 4 (search of health resources) were the least difficult,, followed by items 5 and 8 (utilisation of health information),, and then items 1 and 2 (awareness of health resources). Items 6 and 7 (appraisal of health resources) were most difficult. The measurement properties of eHEALS were not affected by gender,, age,, education or income levels. Female gender,, older age,, intensity of health information seeking,, formal health education and visit at the electronic health-record website were associated with higher eHEALS scores,, as well as best and worst self-perceived health states,, BMI?<?25 and participation at health screenings over the past year.
31098883#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Hungarian eHEALS is a useful and valid tool for measuring subjective eHealth literacy.

26155878#ABSTRACT##In recent years,, there has been increasing discussion of the limitations of traditional randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodologies for the evaluation of eHealth and mHealth interventions,, and in particular,, the requirement that these interventions be locked down during evaluation. Locking down these interventions locks in defects and eliminates the opportunities for quality improvement and adaptation to the changing technological environment,, often leading to validation of tools that are outdated by the time that trial results are published. Furthermore,, because behavioral intervention technologies change frequently during real-world deployment,, even if a tested intervention were deployed in the real world,, its shelf life would be limited. We argue that RCTs will have greater scientific and public health value if they focus on the evaluation of intervention principles (rather than a specific locked-down version of the intervention),, allowing for ongoing quality improvement modifications to the behavioral intervention technology based on the core intervention principles,, while continuously improving the functionality and maintaining technological currency. This paper is an initial proposal of a framework and methodology for the conduct of trials of intervention principles (TIPs) aimed at minimizing the risks of in-trial changes to intervention technologies and maximizing the potential for knowledge acquisition. The focus on evaluation of intervention principles using clinical and usage outcomes has the potential to provide more generalizable and durable information than trials focused on a single intervention technology.

36225895#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#To our knowledge,, this is the first study that identified and evaluated German Covid-19 mobile health apps available in the German app stores. The review shows that despite the excellent quality in aspects like information and functionality,, there is still a gap in the engagement section. To motivate more people to use the Covid-19 apps,, new ideas are needed,, besides more information and education about the functionality of the apps,, to gain trust in app developers and raise the number of downloads.

36213522#ABSTRACT##The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in the heightened need for digital health literacy among the youth of school-going age. Despite the relevance of digital health literacy among the general public (including students),, it appears the measurement of digital health literacy is still a challenge among researchers. Recently,, Dadackinski and colleagues adapted existing digital health literacy measures to fit the COVID-19 situation. Since this development,, the instrument has been widely used with few validation studies with none in Africa and specifically,, in Ghana. The purpose of the study was to assess the validity of the digital health literacy instrument (DHLI) for secondary school students in Ghana using the polychoric factor analysis. We sampled 1,,392 students from secondary schools in Ghana. The digital health literacy instrument was administered to the respondents,, thereof. The study confirmed the four latent structure of the DHLI. Further,, sufficient validity evidence was found regarding the construct validity of the DHLI. The findings from the study support the validity of the DHLI and its utility within the Ghanaian context. With the growing need for digital health literacy among younger people globally,, the DHLI provides sufficient grounds for scaling them based on their level of literacy. There is a need for the instrument to be adapted and re-validated in Ghana and among different populations to widen its reproducibility.

36225895#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of apps to help control the spread of Covid-19 in Germany and rate them according to standardized instruments.
36225895#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify apps dealing with Covid-19 in Germany. The German Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS-G) was used to independently assess app quality by 2 trained reviewers.
36225895#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, the quality of the 6 rated apps was good with a mean score of 4.15 (3.88-4.34). The best-rated apps were NINA app (4.34) and Corona Health App (4.29). The best-rated sections were functionality (4.40),, aesthetic (4.25),, and information (4.25). In contrast,, the worst-rated section was engagement (3.63). Even though some of the apps were used by more people than others,, there was no correlation between the MARS-G rating and app store rating. In addition,, the MARS-G proved to be effective even with rating apps,, which have different goals and methods to achieve them.

31573914#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital health tools comprise a wide range of technologies to support health processes. The potential of these technologies to effectively support health care transformation is widely accepted. However,, wide scale implementation is uneven among countries and regions. Identification of common factors facilitating and hampering the implementation process may be useful for future policy recommendations.
31573914#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to analyze the implementation of digital health tools to support health care and social care services,, as well as to facilitate the longitudinal assessment of these services,, in 17 selected integrated chronic care (ICC) programs from 8 European countries.
31573914#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A program analysis based on thick descriptions-including document examinations and semistructured interviews with relevant stakeholders-of ICC programs in Austria,, Croatia,, Germany,, Hungary,, the Netherlands,, Norway,, Spain,, and the United Kingdom was performed. A total of 233 stakeholders (ie,, professionals,, providers,, patients,, carers,, and policymakers) were interviewed from November 2014 to September 2016. The overarching analysis focused on the use of digital health tools and program assessment strategies.
31573914#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Supporting digital health tools are implemented in all countries,, but different levels of maturity were observed among the programs. Only few ICC programs have well-established strategies for a comprehensive longitudinal assessment. There is a strong relationship between maturity of digital health and proper evaluation strategies of integrated care.
31573914#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Notwithstanding the heterogeneity of the results across countries,, most programs aim to evolve toward a digital transformation of integrated care,, including implementation of comprehensive assessment strategies. It is widely accepted that the evolution of digital health tools alongside clear policies toward their adoption will facilitate regional uptake and scale-up of services with embedded digital health tools.

29574776#ABSTRACT##The increasing miniaturization and affordability of sensors and circuitry has led to the current level of innovation in the area of wearable and microsensor solutions for health monitoring. This facilitates the development of solutions that can be used to measure complex health outcomes in nonspecialist and remote settings. In this article,, we review a number of innovations related to brain monitoring including portable and wearable solutions to directly measure brain electrical activity,, and solutions measuring aspects related to brain function such as sleep patterns,, gait,, cognition,, voice acoustics,, and gaze analysis. Despite the need for more scientific validation work,, we conclude that there is enough understanding of how to implement these approaches as exploratory tools that may provide additional valuable insights due to the rich and frequent data they produce,, to justify their inclusion in clinical study protocols.

34898461#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Musculoskeletal conditions account for 16% of global disability,, resulting in a negative effect on millions of patients and an increasing demand for health care use. Digital technologies to improve health care outcomes and efficiency are considered a priority; however,, innovations are rarely tested with sufficient rigor in clinical trials,, which is the gold standard for clinical proof of safety and efficacy. We have developed a new musculoskeletal digital assessment routing tool (DART) that allows users to self-assess and be directed to the right care. DART requires validation in a real-world setting before implementation.
34898461#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of a future trial by exploring the key aspects of trial methodology,, assessing the procedures,, and collecting exploratory data to inform the design of a definitive randomized crossover noninferiority trial to assess DART safety and effectiveness.

34898461#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We will collect data from 76 adults with a musculoskeletal condition presenting to general practitioners within a National Health Service (NHS) in England. Participants will complete both a DART assessment and a physiotherapist-led triage,, with the order determined by randomization. The primary analysis will involve an absolute agreement intraclass correlation (A,,1) estimate with 95% CI between DART and the clinician for assessment outcomes signposting to condition management pathways. Data will be collected to allow the analysis of participant recruitment and retention,, randomization,, allocation concealment,, blinding,, data collection process,, and bias. In addition,, the impact of trial burden and potential barriers to intervention delivery will be considered. The DART user satisfaction will be measured using the system usability scale.
34898461#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A UK NHS ethics submission was done during June 2021 and is pending approval; recruitment will commence in early 2022,, with data collection anticipated to last for 3 months. The results will be reported in a follow-up paper in 2022.
34898461#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study will inform the design of a randomized controlled crossover noninferiority study that will provide evidence concerning mobile health DART system clinical signposting in an NHS setting before real-world implementation. Success should produce evidence of a safe,, effective system with good usability,, potentially facilitating quicker and easier patient access to appropriate care while reducing the burden on primary and secondary care musculoskeletal services. This rigorous approach to mobile health system testing could be used as a guide for other developers of similar applications.

33372570#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine services can be classified into the macro-categories of specialist Telemedicine,, Tele-health and Tele-assistance. From a regulatory perspective,, in Italy,, the first provision dedicated to the implementation of Telemedicine services is represented by the Agreement between the Government and the Regions on the document bearing "Telemedicine-National guidelines,," approved by the General Assembly of the Superior Health Council in the session of 10th July 2012 and by the State Regions Conference in the session of 20th February 2014. Scientifically,, several studies in the literature state that information and communication technologies have great potential to reduce the costs of health care services in terms of planning and making appropriate decisions that provide timely tools to patients. Another clear benefit is the equity of access to health care. The evolution of telemedicine poses a series of legal problems ranging from the profiles on the subject of authorization and accreditation to those concerning the protection of patient confidentiality,, the definition and solution of which,, in the absence of specific regulatory provisions,, is mainly left to the assessment of compatibility of the practices adopted so far,, with the general regulatory framework. In terms of professional liability,, it is necessary to first clarify that the telemedicine service is comparable to any diagnostic-therapeutic health service considering that the telemedicine service does not replace the traditional health service,, but integrates the latter to improve its effectiveness,, efficiency and appropriateness.

33527701#ABSTRACT#AIMS#This study aimed to compare the psychometric properties of two measures of eHealth literacy,, namely,, the Korean versions of the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (K-DHLI) and eHealth Literacy Scale (K-eHEALS),, among older adults in South Korea.
33527701#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Given the usefulness of eHealth information,, measures of eHealth literacy have been developed. It is necessary to examine the validity of such tools among older adults who are likely to experience difficulties in using eHealth resources.
33527701#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A validation study was conducted using the secondary data of 180 older adults in South Korea. Two weeks after they had responded to the K-DHLI and K-eHEALS,, 89 of them completed the assessments a second time so that the assessments' test-retest reliability could be examined. Using the collected data,, their reliability (i.e. internal consistency,, test-retest reliability) and validity (i.e. construct validity and criterion validity) were examined.
33527701#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both tools demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (a = 0.90,, item-total correlation coefficients = .39-.76) as well as good test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients .77 and .84,, respectively. The 21 items of the K-DHLI loaded onto five factors,, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The 10 items of the K-eHEALS loaded onto a single factor,, which explained 58% of the total variance. The scores of both tools were strongly correlated (r = .63) and positively related to attitudes towards internet health information and subjective health status (r = .23-.50).
33527701#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings suggest that the K-DHLI and K-eHEALS are reliable and valid tools that can be used to assess the utilisation of eHealth resources by older adults.
33527701#ABSTRACT#IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE#The findings can help healthcare providers choose a suitable measure of eHealth literacy when working with older adults.

12235942#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine involves the transfer of medical data for use in diagnosis,, treatment and education. The interaction may involve two-way live audio and video visits between patients and medical professionals,, sending patient monitoring data from the home to a clinic or transmitting patient images and medical file from a primary care provider to a specialist. Telemedicine is already widely used in radiology,, cardiac monitoring and other forms of remote patient monitoring and in targeted population groups such as correctional care populations,, the military and veterans' health care.

23149141#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telemedicine is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to provide health care between distant people. Many activities in transfusion medicine could benefit from the application of telemedicine. To map the spread of the use of telemedicine in transfusion medicine in Italy,, the Italian Society of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology (SIMTI) performed a nationwide survey: the results are presented in this paper.
23149141#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#A survey,, dealing with different aspects of the use of telemedicine,, was performed by sending a questionnaire to 280 Italian Blood Centres. The survey was designed to evaluate the diffusion of telemedicine and the features of the systems,, with special attention to the systems' safety and legal adequacy. One section of the questionnaire was designed to identify the features of the systems considered essential by the respondents.
23149141#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Out of 280 Blood Services contacted,, 196 (70%) filled in at least one of the questions of the online questionnaire. Globally the use of some form of telemedicine was reported by 70% of the respondents. Telemedicine is used for remote validation of laboratory tests by 32% of the Centres that responded,, for remote biological validation of blood units by 34% and for assignment of blood components by 29%. Less frequently,, telemedicine is used to control electronic refrigerators,, for electronic blood requests and for bed-side identification of patients.

23149141#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The use of telemedicine is widespread in Italian Blood Services. There appears to be some heterogeneity between structures with regards to the evaluation of the systems' safety and their legal adequacy. No telemedicine system should be introduced into practice until it has proven to have the same standards of safety as the corresponding "on site" activity.

34431426#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telemedicine,, once defined merely as the treatment of certain conditions remotely,, has now often been supplanted in use by broader terms such as 'virtual care',, in recognition of its increasing capability to deliver a diverse range of healthcare services from afar. With the unexpected onset of COVID-19,, virtual care (e.g. telephone,, video,, online) has become essential to facilitating the continuation of primary care globally. Over several short weeks,, existing healthcare policies have adapted quickly and empowered clinicians to use digital means to fulfil a wide range of clinical responsibilities,, which until then have required face-to-face consultations.
34431426#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#This paper aims to explore the virtual care policies and guidance material published during the initial months of the pandemic and examine their potential limitations and impact on transforming the delivery of primary care in high-income countries.
34431426#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A rapid review of publicly available national policies guiding the use of virtual care in General Practice was conducted. Documents were included if issued in the first six months of the pandemic (March to August of 2020) and focussed primarily on high-income countries. Documents must have been issued by a national health authority,, accreditation body,, or professional organisation,, and directly refer to the delivery of primary care.
34431426#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We extracted six areas of relevance: primary care transformation during COVID-19,, the continued delivery of preventative care,, the delivery of acute care,, remote triaging,, funding & reimbursement,, and security standards.

36350760#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Relational agents (RAs) have shown effectiveness in various health interventions with and without doctors and hospital facilities. In situations such as a pandemic like the COVID-19 pandemic when health care professionals (HCPs) and facilities are unable to cope with increased demands,, RAs may play a major role in ameliorating the situation. However,, they have not been well explored in this domain.
36350760#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to design a prototypical RA in collaboration with COVID-19 patients and HCPs and test it with the potential users,, for its ability to deliver services during a pandemic.
36350760#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The RA was designed and developed in collaboration with people with COVID-19 (n=21) and 2 groups of HCPs (n=19 and n=16,, respectively) to aid COVID-19 patients at various stages by performing 4 main tasks: testing guidance,, support during self-isolation,, handling emergency situations,, and promoting postrecovery mental well-being. A design validation survey was conducted with 98 individuals to evaluate the usability of the prototype using the System Usability Scale (SUS),, and the participants provided feedback on the design. In addition,, the RA's usefulness and acceptability were rated by the participants using Likert scales.
36350760#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the design validation survey,, the prototypical RA received an average SUS score of 58.82. Moreover,, 90% (88/98) of participants perceived it to be helpful,, and 69% (68/98) of participants accepted it as a viable alternative to HCPs. The prototypical RA received favorable feedback from the participants,, and they were inclined to accept it as an alternative to HCPs in non-life-threatening scenarios despite the usability rating falling below the acceptable threshold.
36350760#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Based on participants' feedback,, we recommend further development of the RA with improved automation and emotional support,, ability to provide information,, tracking,, and specific recommendations.

36959755#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#This study featured a survey that offers a snapshot of various teleradiology practices in Turkey,, a Group of Twenty country that has undertaken a major transformation of its health care system during the last two decades and is currently the world leader in terms of the combined number of per capita magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography examinations performed (which represent the bulk of teleradiology services worldwide).
36959755#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study data was collected from 4736 Turkish Society of Radiology (TSR) members via an electronic platform in the web environment through a questionnaire consisting of 24 questions. The survey was conducted in a 3-month time window (March-May 2021). Statistical tools were used for the analysis of the quantitative data.
36959755#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Responses from 156 members of the TSR comprised the study data,, revealing that teleradiology is used for various applications in Turkey. Almost half of the participants (49%) performed teleradiology only in the private sector. Half of the respondents (51%) stated that they reported images at home for multiple centers. Moreover,, 38% of the participants had been reporting more than 50 examinations per day,, and 74% of the respondents earned less than 0.50 Euro per examination they reported. The overall satisfaction with teleradiology among the teleradiologists was,, on average,, 4.7 out of 10 points.
36959755#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The results are both promising for the future (i.e.,, concerning the propensity for adopting new technology) and alarming for the current state of affairs (i.e.,, insufficient radiologist reimbursement and lack of licensing and accreditation of teleradiology service providers). Periodic surveys performed in countries with different health care systems concerning financial,, technical,, and medicolegal aspects might reveal an up-to-date landscape of teleradiology practices worldwide and help guide local and regional decision-makers.

28599674#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#To facilitate the delivery of proven maternal,, neonatal,, and child health (MNCH) services,, a new cadre of village-based frontline workers,, called the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs),, was created in 2005 under the aegis of the National Rural Health Mission in India. Evaluations have noted that coverage of selected MNCH services to be delivered by the ASHAs is low. Reasons for low coverage are inadequate supervision and support to ASHAs apart from insufficient skills,, poor quality of training,, and complexity of tasks to be performed. The proposed study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative intervention based on mobile phone technology (mHealth) to improve the performance of ASHAs through better supervision and support in predominantly tribal and rural communities of Gujarat,, India.
28599674#ABSTRACT#METHODS/DESIGN#This is a two-arm,, stratified,, cluster randomized trial of 36 months in which the units of randomization will be Primary Health Centers (PHCs). There are 11 PHCs in each arm. The intervention is a newly built mobile phone application used in the public health system and evaluated in three ways: (1) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs to increase coverage of MNCH services; (2) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to increase coverage of care among complicated cases by facilitating referrals,, if indicated and home-based care; (3) web interface as a job aid for medical officers and PHC staff to improve supervision and support to the ASHA program. Participants of the study are pregnant women,, mothers,, infants,, ASHAs,, and PHC staff. Primary outcome measures are a composite index made of critical,, proven MNCH services and the proportion of neonates who were visited by ASHAs at home within the first week of birth. Secondary outcomes include coverage of selected MNCH services and care sought by complicated cases. Outcomes will be measured by conducting household surveys at baseline and post-intervention which will be compared with usual practice in the control area,, where the current level of services provided by the government will continue. The primary analysis will be intention to treat.

32412882#ABSTRACT##Introduction: Research is increasing on asynchronous technologies used by specialist clinicians and primary care,, including e-mail,, text,, e-consultation,, and store-and-forward (asynchronous) options. Studies typically describe interventions and care outcomes rather than development of clinical skills for using technology. Methods: This article attempts to compare clinicians' approaches to,, and skills for,, asynchronous technologies versus in-person and synchronous (i.e.,, video) care. Literature from technology,, health care,, pedagogy,, and business were searched from 2000 to 2019 for title words,, including synchronous (e.g.,, video,, telemental or behavioral health,, telepsychiatry),, asynchronous (e.g.,, app,, e-consultation,, e-mail,, text,, sensor in a wearable device),, education,, clinical,, and consultation. Results: From a total of 4,,812 potential references,, two authors (D.M.H.,, J.T.) found 4,,622 eligible for full text review and found 381 articles directly relevant to the concept areas in combination for full text review. However,, exclusion criteria subtracted 305,, leaving a total of 76 articles. While in-person and synchronous care are similar in many ways,, the clinical approach to asynchronous care has many differences. As asynchronous technologies and models of care are feasible and effective,, often for consultation,, an outline of patient,, primary care provider,, and specialist clinician goals and skills are presented. Few studies specifically discuss skills or competencies for asynchronous care,, but components from published clinical informatics,, video,, social media,, and mobile health competencies were organized into Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education domains. Conclusions: Further implementation of science research is needed for asynchronous technology interventions,, as well as clinician competencies using asynchronous technologies,, to ensure optimal outcomes for patients in health care.

35474505#ABSTRACT##Telehealth visits have become an integral model of healthcare delivery since the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid expansion of telehealthcare delivery has forced faculty development and trainee education in telehealth to occur simultaneously. In response,, academic medical institutions have quickly implemented clinical training to teach digital health skills to providers across the medical education continuum. Yet,, learners of all levels must still receive continual assessment and feedback on their skills to align with the telehealth competencies and milestones set forth by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This paper discusses key educational needs and emerging areas for faculty development in telehealth teaching and assessment of telehealth competencies. It proposes strategies for the successful integration of the AAMC telehealth competencies and ACGME milestones into medical education,, including skills in communication,, data gathering,, and patient safety with appropriate telehealth use. Direct observation tools in the paper offer educators novel instruments to assess telehealth competencies in medical students,, residents,, and peer faculty. The integration of AAMC and ACGME telehealth competencies and the new assessment tools in this paper provide a unique perspective to advance clinical practice and teaching skills in telehealthcare delivery.

36858690#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Multiple smart devices capable to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) are presently available. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AF may differ between available smart devices,, and this has not yet been adequately investigated.
36858690#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The aim was to assess the accuracy of 5 smart devices in identifying AF compared with a physician-interpreted 12-lead electrocardiogram as the reference standard in a real-world cohort of patients.
36858690#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We consecutively enrolled patients presenting to a cardiology service at a tertiary referral center in a prospective,, diagnostic study.
36858690#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In this clinical validation of 5 direct-to-consumer smart devices,, we found differences in the amount of inconclusive tracings diminishing sensitivity and specificity of the smart devices. In a clinical setting,, manual review of tracings is required in about one-fourth of cases.

36858690#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We prospectively analyzed 201 patients (31% women,, median age 66.7 years). AF was present in 62 (31%) patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AF were comparable between devices: 85% and 75% for the Apple Watch 6,, 85% and 75% for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3,, 58% and 75% for the Withings Scanwatch,, 66% and 79% for the Fitbit Sense,, and 79% and 69% for the AliveCor KardiaMobile,, respectively. The rate of inconclusive tracings (the algorithm was unable to determine the heart rhythm) was 18%,, 17%,, 24%,, 21%,, and 26% for the Apple Watch 6,, Samsung Galaxy Watch 3,, Withings Scan Watch,, Fitbit Sense,, and AliveCor KardiaMobile (P < 0.01 for pairwise comparison),, respectively. By manual review of inconclusive tracings,, the rhythm could be determined in 955 (99%) of 969 single-lead electrocardiograms. Regarding patient acceptance,, the Apple Watch was ranked first (39% of participants).
36045979#ABSTRACT##E-health has grown into a billion-dollar industry in the last decade. Its device's high throughput makes it an obvious target for cyberattacks,, and these environments desperately need protection. In this scientific study,, we presented an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled intrusion detection system (IDS) to address increasing cyber threats in the E-health and internet of medical things (IoMT) environments. AI's success in various fields,, including big data and intrusion detection systems,, has prompted us to develop a flexible and cost-effective approach to protect such critical environments from cyberattacks. We present a hybrid model consisting of long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed model was thoroughly evaluated using the publicly available CICDDoS2019 dataset and conventional evaluation measures. Furthermore,, for proper validation,, the proposed framework is compared with relevant classifiers,, such as cu-GRU+ DNN and cu-BLSTM. We have further compared the proposed model with existing literature to prove its efficacy. Lastly,, 10-fold cross-validation is also used to verify that our results are unbiased. The proposed approach has bypassed the current literature with extraordinary performance ramifications such as 99.01% accuracy,, 99.04% precision,, 98.80 percent recall,, and 99.12% F1-score.

36326802#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic patient-reported outcomes measures (e-PROMs) are a valuable tool for the monitoring and management of chronic conditions over time. However,, there are few validated tools available that capture symptoms across body systems in telehealth settings. The Parsley Symptom Index (PSI) is a recently developed symptom assessment for adults with chronic disease in telehealth settings. A previous study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the PSI in a clinical telehealth setting.
36326802#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study was to assess convergent validity between the PSI and the self-rated health (SRH) item.

36326802#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This prospective cohort study took place from January 15,, 2021,, to December 15,, 2021,, among a sample of 10,,519 adult patients at Parsley Health,, a subscription-based holistic medical practice. The PSI and the SRH were completed by patients via an online portal. The association between the PSI and SRH was assessed via polyserial and polychoric correlations,, while weighted ? scores provided information related to agreement between the PSI and SRH.
36326802#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From 22,,748 responses,, there were moderate levels of association (polyserial r=0.51; polychoric r=0.52) and agreement (weighted ?=0.46) between the PSI and SRH. In total,, 74.13% (n=16,,865) of responses between the PSI and SRH were relatively congruent while 36.17% (n=8229) were literally congruent.
36326802#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The PSI demonstrates convergent validity with the SRH for adults with chronic disease in a telehealth setting. This finding further supports the validation of the PSI in a real-world clinical setting. Although it is conceptually similar to the 1-question SRH,, the PSI is a 45-item PROM designed to capture quality of life and specific symptoms by body system. Future studies will compare the PSI to multi-item PROMs.

34886266#ABSTRACT##Despite proven advantages for the use of telemedicine in psychiatry,, mental healthcare professionals have shown deep-seated mistrust and suspicion of telepsychiatry,, which hinders its widespread application. The current study examines the attitudes of Israeli mental health professionals towards telepsychiatry and seeks to uncover the effects of experience and organizational affiliation on its adoption. The methodology included qualitative and thematic analysis of 27 in-depth interviews with Israeli mental health professionals,, focusing on three major themes-clinical quality,, economic efficiency,, and the effects on the work-life balance of healthcare professionals. The attitudes of mental health professionals were found to be widely divergent and sharply dichotomized regarding different aspects of telepsychiatry and its suitability for mental healthcare services. However,, there was a general consensus that telemedicine may not fulfil its promise of being a panacea to the problems of modern public medicine. In addition,, attitudes were related to hierarchical position,, organizational affiliation,, and personal experience with telepsychiatry. Specifically,, organizational affiliation influenced experience with and support for the assimilation of telepsychiatry. The study also revealed the role of organizational leadership and culture in promoting or inhibiting the proliferation and adoption of innovative technologies and services in modern medicine.

35044310#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Advancements in digital technologies seek to promote health and access to services. However,, people lacking abilities and confidence to use technology are likely to be left behind,, leading to health disparities. In providing digital health services,, health care providers need to be aware of users' diverse electronic health (eHealth) literacy to address their particular needs and ensure equitable uptake and use of digital services. To understand such needs,, an instrument that captures users' knowledge,, skills,, trust,, motivation,, and experiences in relation to technology is required. The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) is a multidimensional tool with 7 scales covering diverse dimensions of eHealth literacy. The tool was simultaneously developed in English and Danish using a grounded and validity-driven approach and has been shown to have strong psychometric properties.
35044310#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to translate and culturally adapt the eHLQ for application among Mandarin-speaking people with chronic diseases in Taiwan and then undertake a rigorous set of validity-testing procedures.
35044310#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The cross-cultural adaptation of the eHLQ included translation and evaluation of the translations. The measurement properties were assessed using classical test theory and item response theory (IRT) approaches. Content validity,, known-group validity,, and internal consistency were explored,, as well as item characteristic curves (ICCs),, item discrimination,, and item location/difficulty.
35044310#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The adapted version was reviewed,, and a recommended forward translation was confirmed through consensus. The tool exhibited good content validity. A total of 420 people with 1 or more chronic diseases participated in a validity-testing survey. The eHLQ showed good internal consistency (Cronbach a=.75-.95). For known-group validity,, all 7 eHLQ scales showed strong associations with education. Unidimensionality and local independence assumptions were met except for scale 2. IRT analysis showed that all items demonstrated good discrimination (range 0.27-12.15) and a good range of difficulty (range 0.59-1.67) except for 2 items in scale 7.
35044310#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using a rigorous process,, the eHLQ was translated from English into a culturally appropriate tool for use in the Mandarin language. Validity testing provided evidence of satisfactory-to-strong psychometric properties of the eHLQ. The 7 scales are likely to be useful research tools for evaluating digital health interventions and for informing the development of health technology products and interventions that equitably suit diverse users' needs.

30747715#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Smartphone apps are a potential mechanism for development of self-management skills in people with persistent pain. However,, the inclusion of best-practice content items in available pain management apps fostering core self-management skills for self-management support is not known.
30747715#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of the study was to evaluate the contents of smartphone apps providing information on pain management strategies for people with persistent pain facilitating self-management support and to appraise the app quality.
30747715#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search was performed in the New Zealand App Store and Google Play Store. Apps were included if they were designed for people with persistent pain,, provided information on pain self-management strategies,, and were available in English. App contents were evaluated using an a priori 14-item self-management support (SMS-14) checklist. App quality was assessed using the 23-item Mobile Apps Rating Scale.
30747715#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 939 apps screened,, 19 apps met the inclusion criteria. Meditation and guided relaxation were the most frequently included self-management strategies. Overall,, the included apps met a median of 4 (range 1-8) of the SMS-14 checklist. A total of 3 apps (Curable,, PainScale-Pain Diary and Coach,, and SuperBetter) met the largest number of items (8 out of 14) to foster self-management of pain. Self-monitoring of symptoms (n=11) and self-tailoring of strategies (n=9) were frequently featured functions,, whereas a few apps had features facilitating social support and enabling communicating with clinicians. No apps provided information tailored to the cultural needs of the user. The app quality mean scores using Mobile Apps Rating Scale ranged from 2.7 to 4.5 (out of 5.0). Although use of 2 apps (Headspace and SuperBetter) has been shown to improve health outcomes,, none of the included apps have been evaluated in people with persistent pain.

30747715#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Of the 3 apps (Curable,, PainScale-Pain Diary and Coach,, and SuperBetter) that met the largest number of items to support skills in self-management of pain,, 2 apps (PainScale-Pain Diary and Coach and SuperBetter) were free,, suggesting the potential for using apps as a scalable,, wide-reaching intervention to complement face-to-face care. However,, none provided culturally tailored information. Although 2 apps (Headspace and SuperBetter) were validated to show improved health outcomes,, none were tested in people with persistent pain. Both users and clinicians should be aware of such limitations and make informed choices in using or recommending apps as a self-management tool. For better integration of apps in clinical practice,, concerted efforts are required among app developers,, clinicians,, and people with persistent pain in developing apps and evaluating for clinical efficacy.

36574278#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Ultrasound for gestational age (GA) assessment is not routinely available in resource-constrained settings,, particularly in rural and remote locations. The TraCer device combines a handheld wireless ultrasound probe and a tablet with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled software that obtains GA from videos of the fetal head by automated measurements of the fetal transcerebellar diameter and head circumference.
36574278#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of pregnant women,, their families,, and health care workers regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the TraCer device in an appropriate setting.
36574278#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A descriptive study using qualitative methods was conducted in two public health facilities in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya prior to introduction of the new technology. Study participants were shown a video role-play of the use of TraCer at a typical antenatal clinic visit. Data were collected through 6 focus group discussions (N=52) and 18 in-depth interviews.
27913372#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The recently launched Pneumo Rischio eHealth project,, which consists of an app,, a website,, and social networking activity,, is aimed at increasing public awareness of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The launch of this project was prompted by the inadequate awareness of IPD among both laypeople and health care workers,, the heavy socioeconomic burden of IPD,, and the far from optimal vaccination coverage in Italy,, despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines.
27913372#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objectives of our study were to analyze trends in Pneumo Rischio usage before and after a promotional campaign,, to characterize its end users,, and to assess its user-rated quality.
27913372#ABSTRACT#METHODS#At 7 months after launching Pneumo Rischio,, we established a 4-month marketing campaign to promote the project. This intervention used various approaches and channels,, including both traditional and digital marketing strategies. To highlight usage trends,, we used different techniques of time series analysis and modeling,, including a modified Mann-Kendall test,, change-point detection,, and segmented negative binomial regression of interrupted time series. Users were characterized in terms of demographics and IPD risk categories. Customer-rated quality was evaluated by means of a standardized tool in a sample of app users.

36574278#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, TraCer was found to be highly acceptable to women,, their families,, and health care workers,, and its implementation at health care facilities was considered to be feasible. Its introduction was predicted to reduce anxiety regarding fetal well-being,, increase antenatal care attendance,, increase confidence by women in their care providers,, as well as save time and cost by reducing unnecessary referrals. TraCer was felt to increase the self-image of health care workers and reduce time spent providing antenatal care. Some participants expressed hesitancy toward the new technology,, indicating the need to test its performance over time before full acceptance by some users. The preferred cadre of health care professionals to use the device were antenatal clinic nurses. Important implementation considerations included adequate staff training and the need to ensure sustainability and consistency of the service. Misconceptions were common,, with a tendency to overestimate the diagnostic capability,, and expectations that it would provide complete reassurance of fetal and maternal well-being and not primarily the GA.
36574278#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study shows a positive attitude toward TraCer and highlights the potential role of this innovation that uses AI-enabled automation to assess GA. Clarity of messaging about the tool and its role in pregnancy is essential to address misconceptions and prevent misuse. Further research on clinical validation and related usability and safety evaluations are recommended.

27913372#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Over 1 year,, the app was accessed by 9295 users and the website was accessed by 143,,993 users,, while the project's Facebook page had 1216 fans. The promotional intervention was highly effective in increasing the daily number of users. In particular,, the Mann-Kendall trend test revealed a significant (P =.01) increasing trend in both app and website users,, while change-point detection analysis showed that the first significant change corresponded to the start of the promotional campaign. Regression analysis showed a significant immediate effect of the intervention,, with a mean increase in daily numbers of users of 1562% (95% CI 456%-4870%) for the app and 620% (95% CI 176%-1777%) for the website. Similarly,, the postintervention daily trend in the number of users was positive,, with a relative increase of 0.9% (95% CI 0.0%-1.8%) for the app and 1.4% (95% CI 0.7%-2.1%) for the website. Demographics differed between app and website users and Facebook fans. A total of 69.15% (10,,793/15,,608) of users could be defined as being at risk of IPD,, while 4729 users expressed intentions to ask their doctor for further information on IPD. The mean app quality score assigned by end users was approximately 79.5% (397/500).
27913372#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite its specific topic,, Pneumo Rischio was accessed by a considerable number of users,, who ranked it as a high-quality project. In order to reach their target populations,, however,, such projects should be promoted.

29075216#ABSTRACT##Background: Patients prescribed with medication that treats mental health conditions benefit the most compared to those prescribed with other types of medication. However,, they are also the most difficult to adhere. The development of mobile health (mHealth) applications ("apps") to help patients monitor their adherence is fast growing but with limited evidence on their efficacy. There is no evidence on the content of these apps for patients taking psychotropic medication. The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the aims and functioning of available apps that are aiming to help and educate patients to adhere to medication that treats mental health conditions. Method: Three platform descriptions (Apple,, Google,, and Microsoft) were searched between October 2015 and February 2016. Included apps need to focus on adherence to medication that treats mental health conditions and use at least a reinforcement strategy. Descriptive information was extracted and apps evaluated on a number of assessment criteria using content analysis. Results: Sixteen apps were identified. All apps included self-monitoring properties like reminders and psycho-educational properties like mood logs. It was unclear how the latter were used or how adherence was measured. Major barriers to medication adherence like patients' illness and medication beliefs and attitudes were not considered nor where information to patients about mediation side effects. Very few apps were tailored and none was developed based on established theories explaining the processes for successful medication adherence like cognitions and beliefs. Reported information on app development and validation was poor. Discussion: A variety of apps with different properties that tackle both intentional and unintentional non-adherence from a different perspective are identified. An evidence-based approach and co-creation with patients is needed. This will ensure that the apps increase the possibility to impact on non-adherence. Theories like social cognition models can be useful in ensuring that patients' education,, motivation,, skills,, beliefs,, and type of adherence are taken into consideration when developing the apps. Findings from this study can help clinicians and patients make informed choices and pursue policy-makers to integrate evidence when developing future apps. Quality-assurance tools are needed to ensure the apps are systematically evaluated.

28947676#ABSTRACT#CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS#In absence of formal app accreditation,, the ORCHA-24 could feasibly be used to highlight the risk-benefit profiles of health apps prior to downloading.
36178128#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The fight against fake news,, mainly spread through Internet,, is a major public health issue,, even among undergraduate students. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a website promoted by the Italian Federation of the Provincial Orders of the Medical Doctors as a first aid communication kit for health topics.
36178128#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#Pre-post study using a web-based survey,, conducted in April-May 2019 on Medical students and October-November 2020 on Communication Sciences students at the University of Florence (Italy). Methods. Undergraduate students of both schools were exposed to the use of the "dottoremaeveroche" website. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: the Italian-electronic Health Literacy Scale self-assessment tool was used to examine subjects' electronic Health literacy,, and source quality. All responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Changing in perception of abilities were examined using the Wilcoxon test.
36178128#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The 362 participants felt moderately confident in electronic Health Literacy,, with an initial Italian-electronic Health Literacy Scale overall mean score of 3.6±0.7 for medical and 3.2±0.8 for communication students. Medical students had a good idea of how to find helpful sources (3.9±0.8) and communication students felt confident in recognizing their quality (3.5±1.0). In contrast,, their confidence in using Web information to make health decisions was low (medical: 2.9±1.1; communication: 2.8±1.1). All items improved significantly after "dottoremaeveroche" use (p<.001),, with the overall mean score of Italian-electronic Health Literacy Scale increasing to 4.3±0.6 for medical and 4.1±0.8 for communication students.
36178128#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Low electronic health literacy levels can affect public health efforts,, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of "dottoremaeveroche" among students showed the usefulness of online educational interventions that,, if further implemented,, could help combat the spread of infodemic.

34733541#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Given the increasing number of publicly available mental health apps,, we need independent advice to guide adoption. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of current mental health app rating systems and describes the refinement process of one prominent system,, the One Mind PsyberGuide Credibility Rating Scale (PGCRS).
34733541#ABSTRACT#METHODS#PGCRS Version 1 was developed in 2013 and deployed for 7 years,, during which time a number of limitations were identified. Version 2 was created through multiple stages,, including a review of evaluation guidelines and consumer research,, input from scientific experts,, testing,, and evaluation of face validity. We then re-reviewed 161 mental health apps using the updated rating scale,, investigated the reliability and discrepancy of initial scores,, and updated ratings on the One Mind PsyberGuide public app guide.
34733541#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Reliabilities across the scale's 9 items ranged from -0.10 to 1.00,, demonstrating that some characteristics of apps are more difficult to rate consistently. The average overall score of the 161 reviewed mental health apps was 2.51/5.00 (range 0.33-5.00). Ratings were not strongly correlated with app store star ratings,, suggesting that credibility scores provide different information to what is contained in star ratings.
34733541#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#PGCRS summarizes and weights available information in 4 domains: intervention specificity,, consumer ratings,, research,, and development. Final scores are created through an iterative process of initial rating and consensus review. The process of updating this rating scale and integrating it into a procedure for evaluating apps demonstrates one method for determining app quality.

33021487#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Engagement emerges as a predictor for the effectiveness of digital health interventions. However,, a shared understanding of engagement is missing. Therefore,, a new scale has been developed that proposes a clear definition and creates a tool to measure it. The TWente Engagement with Ehealth Technologies Scale (TWEETS) is based on a systematic review and interviews with engaged health app users. It defines engagement as a combination of behavior,, cognition,, and affect.

33164594#ABSTRACT##The expansion of mobile health apps for the management of COVID-19 grew exponentially in recent months. However,, no study has evaluated these apps. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable measure and rate the quality of COVID-19 mobile health apps,, to eventually provide a roadmap for future mHealth app development. In this study,, we used COVID-related keywords to identify apps for iOS and Android devices. 13 apps (13.5% of the total number of apps identified) were selected for evaluation. App quality was assessed independently using MARS by two reviewers. Search queries yielded a total of 97 potentially relevant apps,, of which 13 met our final inclusion criteria. Kendall's coefficient of concordance value for the inter-rater agreement was 0.93 (p = .03). COVID-19 GOV PK app had the highest average MARS score (4.7/5),, and all of the apps had acceptable MARS scores (> 3.0). This study suggests that most COVID-related apps meet acceptable criteria for quality,, content,, or functionality,, and they must highlight esthetic and interesting features for overall quality improvement to be welcomed by users.

31682181#ABSTRACT##Background: Patient and/or provider satisfaction and experience are among the most important indicators for quality assurance of health care services,, including telehealth. Validated surveys should be used for this purpose to provide reliable information for a program evaluation. Objective: To validate the newly developed satisfaction surveys,, report patient,, and provider satisfaction with Antenatal and Neonatal Guidelines,, Education and Learning Systems (ANGELS) telehealth services. Methods: Two self-administered paper surveys were developed by a multidisciplinary team. The surveys were validated among obstetric patients who received telehealth services in 2016 and providers in Arkansas from July to August 2017. Psychometric testing was performed to establish reliability and validity of both the surveys. Descriptive statistics was performed to describe patient and provider satisfaction. Results: A total of 89 patient- and 66 provider surveys were analyzed. Construct validity and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's a >0.7) were confirmed on both the surveys. The majority of patients were highly satisfied with telehealth services and reported positive perceptions toward future use of services. In the past 12 months,, telehealth (78.6%) was the most used ANGELS service by providers. Finally,, >90% of the providers reported high satisfaction and rated telehealth services as "excellent." Conclusions: The newly developed patient and provider telehealth surveys were reliable and valid. The surveys also demonstrated that the telehealth services were well-accepted and highly valued in a sample of obstetric patients and providers. As both surveys are short,, they can be used in routine evaluation of patient and provider satisfaction with similar telehealth programs in the country.
33021487#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the TWEETS. In addition,, a comparison is made with the experiential part of the Digital Behavior Change Intervention Engagement Scale (DBCI-ES-Ex),, a scale that showed some issues in previous psychometric analyses.
33021487#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The TWEETS performs quite well as an engagement measure with high internal consistency,, reasonable test-retest reliability and convergent validity,, good divergent validity,, and reasonable predictive validity. As the psychometric quality of a scale is a reflection of how closely a scale matches the conceptualization of a concept,, this paper is also an attempt to conceptualize and define engagement as a unique concept,, providing a first step toward an acceptable standard of defining and measuring engagement.

33021487#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this study,, 288 participants were asked to use any step counter app on their smartphones for 2 weeks. They completed online questionnaires at 4 time points: T0=baseline,, T1=after 1 day,, T2=1 week,, and T3=2 weeks. At T0,, demographics and personality (conscientiousness and intellect/imagination) were assessed; at T1-T3,, engagement,, involvement,, enjoyment,, subjective usage,, and perceived behavior change were included as measures that are theoretically related to our definition of engagement. Analyses focused on internal consistency,, reliability,, and the convergent,, divergent,, and predictive validity of both engagement scales. Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the engagement scales with involvement,, enjoyment,, and subjective usage; divergent validity was assessed by correlating the engagement scales with personality; and predictive validity was assessed by regression analyses using engagement to predict perceived behavior change at later time points.
33021487#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Cronbach alpha values of the TWEETS were .86,, .86,, and .87 on T1,, T2,, and T3,, respectively. Exploratory factor analyses indicated that a 1-factor structure best fits the data. The TWEETS is moderately to strongly correlated with involvement and enjoyment (theoretically related to cognitive and affective engagement,, respectively; P<.001). Correlations between the TWEETS and frequency of use were nonsignificant or small,, and differences between adherers and nonadherers on the TWEETS were significant (P<.001). Correlations between personality and the TWEETS were nonsignificant. The TWEETS at T1 was predictive of perceived behavior change at T3,, with an explained variance of 16%. The psychometric properties of the TWEETS and the DBCI-ES-Ex seemed comparable in some aspects (eg,, internal consistency),, and in other aspects,, the TWEETS seemed somewhat superior (divergent and predictive validity).
28947676#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Applications- 24 Question Assessment (ORCHA-24),, 24 app assessment criteria concerning data privacy,, clinical efficacy and user experience,, answered on a 'yes' or 'no' and evidence-driven basis,, was applied to assess 18 insomnia apps identified via the Android Google Play Store,, in addition to the NHS-approved iOS app Sleepio.
28947676#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#63.2% of apps (12/19) provided a privacy policy,, with seven (36.8%) stating no user data would be shared without explicit consent. 10.5% (2/19) stated they had been shown to be of benefit to those with insomnia,, with cognitive behavioural therapy apps outperforming hypnosis and meditation apps (p=0.046). Both the number of app downloads (p=0.29) and user-review scores (p=0.23) were unrelated to ORCHA-24 scores. The NHS-approved app Sleepio,, consistently outperformed non-accredited apps across all domains of the ORCHA-24.
28947676#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Apps for chronic insomnia disorder exhibit substantial variation in adherence to published data privacy,, user experience and clinical efficacy standards,, which are not clearly correlated with app downloads or user-review scores.

31444874#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Technological advancements,, together with the decrease in both price and size of a large variety of sensors,, has expanded the role and capabilities of regular mobile phones,, turning them into powerful yet ubiquitous monitoring systems. At present,, smartphones have the potential to continuously collect information about the users,, monitor their activities and behaviors in real time,, and provide them with feedback and recommendations.
31444874#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review aimed to identify recent scientific studies that explored the passive use of smartphones for generating health- and well-being-related outcomes. In addition,, it explores users' engagement and possible challenges in using such self-monitoring systems.
31444874#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic review was conducted,, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines,, to identify recent publications that explore the use of smartphones as ubiquitous health monitoring systems. We ran reproducible search queries on PubMed,, IEEE Xplore,, ACM Digital Library,, and Scopus online databases and aimed to find answers to the following questions: (1) What is the study focus of the selected papers? (2) What smartphone sensing technologies and data are used to gather health-related input? (3) How are the developed systems validated? and (4) What are the limitations and challenges when using such sensing systems?
31444874#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our bibliographic research returned 7404 unique publications. Of these,, 118 met the predefined inclusion criteria,, which considered publication dates from 2014 onward,, English language,, and relevance for the topic of this review. The selected papers highlight that smartphones are already being used in multiple health-related scenarios. Of those,, physical activity (29.6%; 35/118) and mental health (27.9; 33/118) are 2 of the most studied applications. Accelerometers (57.7%; 67/118) and global positioning systems (GPS; 40.6%; 48/118) are 2 of the most used sensors in smartphones for collecting data from which the health status or well-being of its users can be inferred.
31444874#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#One relevant outcome of this systematic review is that although smartphones present many advantages for the passive monitoring of users' health and well-being,, there is a lack of correlation between smartphone-generated outcomes and clinical knowledge. Moreover,, user engagement and motivation are not always modeled as prerequisites,, which directly affects user adherence and full validation of such systems.

31540042#ABSTRACT##During the last decades there has been a rapidly growing elderly population and the number of patients with chronic heart-related diseases has exploded. Many of them (such as those with congestive heart failure or some types of arrhythmias) require close medical supervision,, thus imposing a big burden on healthcare costs in most western economies. Specifically,, continuous or frequent Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring are important tools in the follow-up of many of these patients. In this work,, we present a novel remote non-ambulatory and clinically validated heart self-monitoring system,, which allows ABP and ECG monitoring to effectively identify clinically relevant arrhythmias. The system integrates digital transmission of the ECG and tensiometer measurements,, within a patient-comfortable support,, easy to recharge and with a multi-function software,, all of them aiming to adapt for elderly people. The main novelty is that both physiological variables (ABP and ECG) are simultaneously measured in an ambulatory environment,, which to our best knowledge is not readily available in the clinical market. Different processing techniques were implemented to analyze the heart rhythm,, including pause detection,, rhythm alterations and atrial fibrillation,, hence allowing early detection of these diseases. Our results achieved clinical quality both for in-lab hardware testing and for ambulatory scenario validations. The proposed active assisted living (AAL) Sensor-based system is an end-to-end multidisciplinary system,, fully connected to a platform and tested by the clinical team from beginning to end.

35414269#ABSTRACT##Digital health applications can improve quality and effectiveness of healthcare,, by offering a number of new tools to users,, which are often considered a medical device. Assuring their safe operation requires,, amongst others,, clinical validation,, needing large datasets to test them in realistic clinical scenarios. Access to datasets is challenging,, due to patient privacy concerns. Development of synthetic datasets is seen as a potential alternative. The objective of the paper is the development of a method for the generation of realistic synthetic datasets,, statistically equivalent to real clinical datasets,, and demonstrate that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based approach is fit for purpose. A generative adversarial network was implemented and trained,, in a series of six experiments,, using numerical and categorical variables,, including ICD-9 and laboratory codes,, from three clinically relevant datasets. A number of contextual steps provided the success criteria for the synthetic dataset. A synthetic dataset that exhibits very similar statistical characteristics with the real dataset was generated. Pairwise association of variables is very similar. A high degree of Jaccard similarity and a successful K-S test further support this. The proof of concept of generating realistic synthetic datasets was successful,, with the approach showing promise for further work.

31381501#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to provide an overview of mobile rheumatology apps currently available in German app stores,, evaluate app quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS),, and compile brief,, ready-to-use descriptions for patients and rheumatologists.
31381501#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The German App Store and Google Play store were systematically searched to identify German rheumatology mobile apps for patient and physician use. MARS was used to independently assess app quality by 8 physicians,, 4 using Android and 4 using iOS smartphones. Apps were randomly assigned so that 4 apps were rated by all raters and the remaining apps were rated by two Android and two iOS users. Furthermore,, brief app descriptions including app developers,, app categories,, and features were compiled to inform potential users and developers.
31381501#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 128 and 63 apps were identified in the German Google Play and App Store,, respectively. After removing duplicates and only including apps that were available in both stores,, 28 apps remained. Sixteen apps met the inclusion criteria,, which were (1) German language,, (2) availability in both app stores,, (3) targeting patients or physicians as users,, and (4) clearly including rheumatology or rheumatic diseases as subject matter. Exclusion criteria were (1) congress apps and (2) company apps with advertisements. Nine apps addressed patients and 7 apps addressed physicians. No clinical studies to support the effectiveness and safety of apps could be found. Pharmaceutical companies were the main developers of two apps. Rheuma Auszeit was the only app mainly developed by a patient organization. This app had the highest overall MARS score (4.19/5). Three out of 9 patient apps featured validated questionnaires. The median overall MARS score was 3.85/5,, ranging from 2.81/5 to 4.19/5. One patient-targeted and one physician-targeted app had MARS scores >4/5. No significant rater gender or platform (iOS/Android) differences could be observed. The overall correlation between app store ratings and MARS scores was low and inconsistent between platforms.
31381501#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#To our knowledge,, this is the first study that systematically identified and evaluated mobile apps in rheumatology for patients and physicians available in German app stores. We found a lack of supporting clinical studies,, use of validated questionnaires,, and involvement of academic developers. Overall app quality was heterogeneous. To create high-quality apps,, closer cooperation led by patients and physicians is vital.

32293569#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Technology-based physical activity suggests new opportunities for public health initiatives. Yet only 45% of technology interventions are theoretically based,, and the acceptability mechanisms have been insufficiently studied. Acceptability and acceptance theories have provided interesting insights,, particularly the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2). In several studies,, the psychometric qualities of acceptability scales have not been well demonstrated.
32293569#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to adapt the UTAUT2 to the electronic health (eHealth) context and provide a preliminary validation of the eHealth acceptability scale in a French sample.
32293569#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In line with the reference validation methodologies,, we carried out the following stages of validating the scale with a total of 576 volunteers: translation and adaptation,, dimensionality tests,, reliability tests,, and construct validity tests. We used confirmatory factor analysis to validate a 22-item instrument with 7 subscales: Performance Expectancy,, Effort Expectancy,, Social Influence,, Facilitating Conditions,, Hedonic Motivation,, Price Value,, and Habit.
32293569#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#/df=2.51,, comparative fit index=.97,, Tucker-Lewis index=.95,, and root mean square error of approximation=.053 (90% CI .047-.059). The invariance tests of the eHealth acceptability factor structure by sex demonstrated no significant differences between models,, except for the strict model. The partial strict model demonstrated no difference from the strong model. Cronbach alphas ranged from .77 to .95 for the 7 factors. We measured the internal reliability with a 4-week interval. The intraclass correlation coefficients for each subscale ranged from .62 to .88,, and there were no significant differences in the t tests from time 1 to time 2. Assessments for convergent validity demonstrated that the eHealth acceptability constructs were significantly and positively related to behavioral intention,, usage,, and constructs from the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior.
32293569#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The 22-item French-language eHealth acceptability scale,, divided into 7 subscales,, showed good psychometric qualities. This scale is thus a valid and reliable tool to assess the acceptability of eHealth technology in French-speaking samples and offers promising avenues in research,, clinical practice,, and marketing.

33247983#ABSTRACT##Frailty is associated with adverse kidney transplant outcomes and can be assessed by subjective and objective metrics. There is increasing recognition of the value of metrics obtainable remotely. We compared the self-reported SF-36 physical functioning subscale score (SF-36 PF) with in-person physical performance tests (6-min walk and sit-to-stand) in a prospective cohort of kidney transplant candidates. We assessed each metric's ability to predict time to the composite outcome of waitlist removal or death,, censoring at transplant. We built time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and calculated the area under the curve [AUC(t)] at 1 year,, using bootstrapping for internal validation. In 199 patients followed for a median of 346 days,, 41 reached the composite endpoint. Lower SF-36 PF scores were associated with higher risk of waitlist removal/death,, with every 10-point decrease corresponding to a 16% increase in risk. All models showed an AUC(t) of 0.83-0.84 that did not contract substantially after internal validation. Among kidney transplant candidates,, SF-36 PF,, obtainable remotely,, can help to stratify the risk of waitlist removal or death,, and may be used as a screening tool for poor physical functioning in ongoing candidate evaluation,, particularly where travel,, increasing patient volume,, or other restrictions challenge in-person assessment.

26328890#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Studies found that treatment symptoms of concern to oncology/hematology patients were greatly under-identified in medical records. On average,, 11.0 symptoms were reported of concern to patients compared to 1.5 symptoms identified in their medical records. A solution to this problem is use of an electronic symptom checklist that can be easily accessed by patients prior to clinical consultations.
26328890#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Describe the oncology Therapy-Related Symptom Checklists for Adults (TRSC) and Children (TRSC-C),, which are validated bases for e-Health symptom documentation and management. The TRSC has 25 items/symptoms; the TRSC-C has 30 items/symptoms. These items capture up to 80% of the variance of patient symptoms. Measurement properties and applications with outpatients are presented. E-Health applications are indicated.

26328890#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Research has found high levels of patient/clinician satisfaction,, no increase in clinic costs,, and strong correlations of TRSC/TRSC-C with medical outcomes. A recently published sequential cohort trial with adult outpatients at a Mayo Clinic community cancer center found TRSC use produced a 7.2% higher patient quality of life,, 116% more symptoms identified/managed,, and higher functional status.
26328890#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION,, IMPLICATIONS,, AND FOLLOW-UP#An electronic system has been built to collect TRSC symptoms,, reassure patients,, and enhance patient-clinician communications. This report discusses system design and efforts made to provide an electronic system comfortable to patients. Methods used by clinicians to promote comfort and patient engagement were examined and incorporated into system design. These methods included (a) conversational data collection as opposed to survey style or standardized questionnaires,, (b) short response phrases indicating understanding of the reported symptom,, (c) use of open-ended questions to reduce long lists of symptoms,, (d) directed questions that ask for confirmation of expected symptoms,, (e) review of symptoms at designated stages,, and (d) alerting patients when the computer has informed clinicians about patient-reported symptoms.
26328890#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#An e-Health symptom checklist (TRSC/TRSC-C) can facilitate identification,, monitoring,, and management of symptoms; enhance patient-clinician communications; and contribute to improved patient outcomes.

31486409#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The increasing prevalence and economic impact of chronic diseases challenge health care systems globally. Digital solutions can potentially improve efficiency and quality of care,, but these initiatives struggle with nonusage attrition. Machine learning methods have been proven to predict dropouts in other settings but lack implementation in health care.
31486409#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to gain insight into the causes of attrition for patients in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention for chronic lifestyle diseases and evaluate if attrition can be predicted and consequently prevented. We aimed to build predictive models that can identify patients in a digital lifestyle intervention at high risk of dropout by analyzing several predictor variables applied in different models and to further assess the possibilities and impact of implementing such models into an eHealth platform.

31486409#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data from 2684 patients using an eHealth platform were iteratively analyzed using logistic regression,, decision trees,, and random forest models. The dataset was split into a 79.99% (2147/2684) training and cross-validation set and a 20.0% (537/2684) holdout test set. Trends in activity patterns were analyzed to assess engagement over time. Development and implementation were performed iteratively with health coaches.
31486409#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Patients in the test dataset were classified as dropouts with an 89% precision using a random forest model and 11 predictor variables. The most significant predictors were the provider of the intervention,, 2 weeks inactivity,, and the number of advices received from the health coach. Engagement in the platform dropped significantly leading up to the time of dropout.
31486409#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Dropouts from eHealth lifestyle interventions can be predicted using various data mining methods. This can support health coaches in preventing attrition by receiving proactive warnings. The best performing predictive model was found to be the random forest.

33554583#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#There are many mobile health applications (apps) now available and some that use in some way laboratory medicine data. Among them,, patient-oriented are of the lowest content quality. The aim of this study was to compare the opinions of non-laboratory medicine professionals (NLMP) with those of laboratory medicine specialists (LMS) and define the benchmarks for quality assessment of laboratory medicine apps.
33554583#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Twenty-five volunteers from six European countries evaluated 16 selected patient-oriented apps. Participants were 20-60 years old,, 44% were females,, with different educational degrees,, and no professional involvement in laboratory medicine. Each participant completed a questionnaire based on the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and the System Usability Scale,, as previously used for rating the app quality by LMS. The responses from the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation.
33554583#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The median total score of NLMP app evaluation was 2.73 out of 5 (IQR 0.95) compared to 3.78 (IQR 1.05) by the LMS. All scores were statistically significantly lower in the NLMP group (p<0.05),, except for the item Information quality (p=0.1631). The suggested benchmarks for a useful appear: increasing awareness of the importance and delivering an understanding of persons' own laboratory test results; understandable terminology; easy to use; appropriate graphic design,, and trustworthy information.
33554583#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#NLMP' evaluation confirmed the low utility of currently available laboratory medicine apps. A reliable app should contain trustworthy and understandable information. The appearance of an app should be fit for purpose and easy to use.

15361032#ABSTRACT##Tele-echocardiography is not widely used because of lengthy transmission times when using standard Motion Pictures Expert Groups (MPEG)-2 lossy compression algorythms,, unless expensive high bandwidth lines are used. We sought to validate the newer MPEG-4 algorythms to allow further reduction in echocardiographic motion video file size. Four cardiologists expert in echocardiography read blindly 165 randomized uncompressed and compressed 2D and color Doppler normal and pathologic motion images. One Digital Video and 3 MPEG-4 compression algorythms were tested,, the latter at 3 decreasing compression quality levels (100%,, 65% and 40%). Mean diagnostic and image quality scores were computed for each file and compared across the 3 compression levels using uncompressed files as controls. File dimensions decreased from a range of uncompressed 12-83 MB to MPEG-4 0.03-2.3 MB. All algorythms showed mean scores that were not significantly different from uncompressed source,, except the MPEG-4 DivX algorythm at the highest selected compression (40%,, p=.002). These data support the use of MPEG-4 compression to reduce echocardiographic motion image size for transmission purposes,, allowing cost reduction through use of low bandwidth lines.
19659414#ABSTRACT##The challenges faced and the methods implemented by the Apollo Hospitals Group in introducing telemedicine in the Indian setting are discussed in this article. Using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to make available secondary and tertiary medical expertise to suburban and rural India was thought of as early as 1997. In March 2000,, the world's first Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)-enabled village hospital was commissioned. Today,, with 115 centers including 9 overseas,, the Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation (ATNF) is the oldest and largest multispecialty telemedicine network. More than 57,,000 teleconsultations in various disciplines,, ranging from sexual medicine to neurosurgery,, have been provided. Patients have been evaluated from distances ranging from 120 to 4,,500 miles. A majority (85%) of these teleconsults were reviews. The successful proof of concept validation studies,, carried out from 2000 to 2001 by Apollo,, were instrumental in the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) including telemedicine as a major thrust area. The pioneering role played by Apollo is also discussed in using VSAT-enabled Hospitals on Wheels. The paper reviews the significant role played by ATNF in the growth and development of telemedicine in South Asia. Academic activities are also highlighted. The pioneering efforts in the field of m-health,, home telecare,, the Pan African e-Network Project,, starting the first formal educational course in telehealth and various other e-initiatives are elaborated.
33254109#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine is the provision of services by health professionals through the use of information and communication technologies. Its implementation is usually carried out through systems of va riable usability. In 2016,, Parmanto et al,, developed and validated a questionnaire in English that measures its usability and allows to evaluate all factors that influence it. In 2019,, we translated,, adapted cross-culturally,, and published this questionnaire in Spanish. With the aim of transforming it into a reliable and accessible tool,, the utility of which is indisputable in the current context,, we carried out a research work that allowed its validation and simplification.

33847596#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Persuasion knowledge,, commonly referred to as advertising literacy,, is a cognitive dimension that embraces recognition of advertising,, its source and audience,, and understanding of advertisers' persuasive and selling intents as well as tactics. There is little understanding of users' awareness of organizations that develop or sponsor mobile health (mHealth) apps,, especially in light of personal data privacy. Persuasion knowledge or recognition of a supporting organization's presence,, characteristics,, competencies,, intents,, and persuasion tactics are crucial to investigate because app users have the right to know about entities that support apps and make informed decisions about app usage. The abundance of free consumer mHealth apps,, especially those in the area of fitness,, often makes it difficult for users to identify apps' dual purposes,, which may be related to not only helping the public manage health but also promoting the supporting organization itself and collecting users' information for further consumer targeting by third parties.
33847596#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to investigate smartphone users' awareness of mHealth apps' affiliations with 3 different types of supporting organizations (commercial,, government,, and nonprofit); differences in users' persuasion knowledge and mHealth app quality and credibility evaluations related to each of the 3 organization types; and users' coping mechanisms for dealing with personal information management within consumer mHealth apps.
33847596#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 smartphone users from a local community in midwestern United States. Interviews were thematically analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches.
33847596#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The discussion of and recommendations for the safe and ethical use of mHealth apps associated with organizations' promotional strategies and personal data protection are provided to ensure users' awareness of and enhanced control over digitalized personal information flows. The theoretical implications are discussed in the context of the Persuasion Knowledge Model and dual-processing theories.

33847596#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Participants indicated that their awareness of and interest in mHealth app-supporting organizations were secondary to the app's health management functions. After being probed,, participants showed a high level of persuasion knowledge regarding the types of app-supporting organizations and their promotional intents. They thought that commercial companies sponsored mHealth apps mostly as entertainment tools,, whereas noncommercial entities sponsored mHealth apps for users' education. They assigned self-promotional motives to commercial organizations; however,, they associated commercial mHealth apps with good quality and functioning. Noncommercial entities were perceived as more credible. Participants were concerned about losing control over personal information within mHealth apps supported by different organizations. They used alternative digital identities to protect themselves from privacy invasion and advertising spam. They were willing to trade some personal information for high-quality commercial mHealth apps. There was a sense of fatalism in discussing privacy risks linked to mHealth app usage,, and some participants did not perceive the risks to be serious.

35055724#ABSTRACT##Telehealth is a growing domain with particular relevance for remote patient monitoring. With respect to the biopsychosocial model of health,, it is important to evaluate perception and satisfaction with new methods in telehealth as part of an integrative approach. The Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ) is a 17-item questionnaire measuring patients' perception of and satisfaction with telecare. We translated this survey into German and determined its validity and reliability in 32 adolescents and adults. Furthermore,, we derived a short version of the TMPQ,, named Patient and Physician Satisfaction with Monitoring (PPSM),, which is a 5-item questionnaire that can be administered to both patients and physicians. Validity and reliability were tested in 32 patients and 32 physicians. Crohnbach's a for the translated TMPQ was 0.76,, and the German version yielded high validity (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.995). We tested the PPSM in both patients and physicians and found acceptable values for Crohnbach's a (0.72 and 0.78) with excellent validity (ICC 0.965). We therefore concluded from this small study that both German versions of the TMPQ and PPSM can be used to investigate the acceptance of telehealth applications.

32784176#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Despite the reported benefits of CPAP therapy in treating OSA,, its effectiveness is reduced by less-than-optimal adherence or use. Up to 50% of patients who accept CPAP therapy fail to adhere to it. As a lack of commitment to CPAP therapy is one of the most significant factors that hinder OSA treatment effectiveness,, patient motivation and education are critical to help alleviate the problem of poor CPAP adherence or use.
32784176#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to support the development of mobile health interventions or information systems solutions to promote CPAP adherence and use among patients with OSA through development,, content validation,, and testing of tailored motivational messages.
32784176#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In phase 1,, an initial library of 60 messages was developed to promote CPAP use among patients with OSA. In phase 2,, draft messages were evaluated for content validation testing for relevance and clarity by research and clinical experts. In phase 3,, patients with OSA (N=24) were recruited through a Qualtrics panel to rate the perceived persuasiveness of the messages in terms of threat and efficacy perceptions,, as per their computed extended parallel process model (EPPM) response states. The average score of the ratings was calculated for each message. The messages were sorted according to their average (from highest to lowest) to select the best 12 messages for each tailored set based on the potential responses from the EPPM.
32784176#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In phase 1,, 60 messages were developed based on the existing literature and a review of existing materials. In phase 2,, the enumerated content validity of the messages was established through the use of the content validity index for items. A total of 57 messages were found to have acceptable content relevance and clarity. In phase 3,, patients with OSA perceived the final library of 48 messages to be persuasive.
32784176#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#After the process of content validation and testing,, the final library of messages met the criteria for clarity,, relevance,, and perceived persuasiveness. This study emphasizes the importance of developing and validating the content of motivational messages,, grounded in EPPM theory,, across the 4 possible response states in terms of high or low efficacy and threat perceptions.

32295030#ABSTRACT##There is a need for health professionals to provide parents with not only evidence-based child health websites but also instruments to evaluate them. The main aim of this research was to develop a questionnaire for measuring users' evaluation of the usability,, utility,, confidence,, the well-child section,, and the accessibility of a Spanish pediatric eHealth website for parents. We further sought to evaluate the content validity and psychometric reliability of the instrument. A content validation study by expert review was performed,, and the questionnaire was pilot tested. Psychometric analyses were used to establish scales through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Reliability studies were performed using Cronbach's alpha and two split-half methods. The content validation of the questionnaire by experts was considered as excellent. The pilot web survey was completed by 516 participants. The exploratory factor analysis excluded 27 of the 41 qualitative initial items. The confirmatory factor analysis of the resultant 14-item questionnaire confirmed the five initial domains detected in the exploratory confirmatory analysis. The goodness of fit for the competing models was established through fit indices and confirmed the previously established domains. Adequate internal consistency was found for each of the subscales as well as the overall scale.

36379608#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#Mobile health applications are instrumental in the self-management of chronic diseases like diabetes. Technology acceptance models such as Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) have proven essential for predicting the acceptance of information technology. However,, earlier research has found that the constructs "perceived disease threat" and "trust" should be added to UTAUT2 in the mHealth acceptance context. This study aims to evaluate the extended UTAUT2 model for predicting mHealth acceptance,, represented by behavioral intention,, using mobile diabetes applications as an example.
36379608#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We extended UTAUT2 with the additional constructs "perceived disease threat" and "trust". We conducted a web-based survey in German-speaking countries focusing on patients with diabetes and their relatives who have been using mobile diabetes applications for at least 3?months. We analysed 413 completed questionnaires by structural equation modelling.

36379608#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We could confirm that the newly added constructs "perceived disease threat" and "trust" indeed predict behavioural intention to use mobile diabetes applications. We could also confirm the UTAUT2 constructs "performance expectancy" and "habit" to predict behavioural intention to use mobile diabetes applications. The results show that the extended UTAUT2 model could explain 35.0% of the variance in behavioural intention.
36379608#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Even if UTAUT2 is well established in the information technologies sector to predict technology acceptance,, our results reveal that the original UTAUT2 should be extended by "perceived disease threat" and "trust" to better predict mHealth acceptance.
36379608#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Despite the newly added constructs,, UTAUT2 can only partially predict mHealth acceptance. Future research should investigate additional mHealth acceptance factors,, including how patients perceive trust in mHealth applications.

35880959#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The logical model developed allowed the comprehension of the program structure,, the interaction among the activities carried out and the expected results of the "Alô Enfermeiro".
30560619#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine technology is a means of deploying medical resources with low cost and high efficiency. A set of remote radiotherapy system based on Citrix was designed in this paper,, so that the senior radiation therapists from the developed areas can provide medical services effectively for the patients in the rural areas. This paper focused on the design ideas and the detail of the technical implementation of how to design a remote radiotherapy system based on the existing equipment in the primary hospital. And the technical reliability and security of the remote radiotherapy system were verified by the scientific test method with pairwise comparison. The early practical experience shows that through the remote radiotherapy system the primary radiotherapy personnel and the radiotherapy experts from thirdgrade class-A hospital can form effective alliance in radiotherapy techniques to allow patients in rural areas to receive more professional radiation therapy.

26290093#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#One factor when assessing the quality of mobile apps is quantifying the impact of a given app on a population. There is currently no metric which can be used to compare the population impact of a mobile app across different health care disciplines.
26290093#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to create a novel metric to characterize the impact of a mobile app on a population.
26290093#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed the simple novel metric,, app usage factor (AUF),, defined as the logarithm of the product of the number of active users of a mobile app with the median number of daily uses of the app. The behavior of this metric was modeled using simulated modeling in Python,, a general-purpose programming language. Three simulations were conducted to explore the temporal and numerical stability of our metric and a simulated app ecosystem model using a simulated dataset of 20,,000 apps.
26290093#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Simulations confirmed the metric was stable between predicted usage limits and remained stable at extremes of these limits. Analysis of a simulated dataset of 20,,000 apps calculated an average value for the app usage factor of 4.90 (SD 0.78). A temporal simulation showed that the metric remained stable over time and suitable limits for its use were identified.
26290093#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A key component when assessing app risk and potential harm is understanding the potential population impact of each mobile app. Our metric has many potential uses for a wide range of stakeholders in the app ecosystem,, including users,, regulators,, developers,, and health care professionals. Furthermore,, this metric forms part of the overall estimate of risk and potential for harm or benefit posed by a mobile medical app. We identify the merits and limitations of this metric,, as well as potential avenues for future validation and research.

20042903#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study evaluates technical requirements,, privacy and legal constraints,, reimbursement considerations,, and overall feasibility of a new telemedicine neurotologic patient care delivery model in post-Katrina,, Southeast Louisiana.
20042903#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study is a retrospective review of the first year of a telemedicine neurotology practice with limited on-site neurotology physician availability (3-days monthly) with a full-time on-site audiologist,, a full-time specialty-trained nurse practitioner,, full-time neurosurgery on-site availability,, and full-time otolaryngology on-site availability.
20042903#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A combined "store-and-forward" and "real-time" telemedicine delivery model was implemented for a new neurotology practice. Technical requirements include secure data transfer,, real-time video-streaming,, high-quality video otoscopy and microscopy,, infrared video eye movement visualization and recording,, remote visualization of radiologic imaging studies,, and formalized diagnostic algorithms for patient evaluation. Telemedicine patient evaluations occur with the patient in Baton Rouge,, LA,, while the examining neurotologist is linked through a secure,, commercially available communication connection in Pittsburgh,, PA. Specifically designed consent forms and bilocation licensing and liability insurance coverage were required. Third-party payers were consulted before implementation to assure adherence to local reimbursement requirements. During the first 12 months of operation,, 450 patient encounters were accomplished purely through telemedicine,, with an additional 800 on-site patient visits and 150 operative procedures,, including 24 neurotologic skull base procedures.
20042903#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Telemedicine is a viable delivery model for neurotology care delivery. Planning and implementation of such a model requires systematic considerations of medical,, nursing,, information systems,, legal,, reimbursement,, and management parameters. Although the authors' initial motivation for this model was the resource-restricted,, post-Katrina health care environment in South Louisiana,, this delivery model has wider applicability in otolaryngology,, other medical specialties,, humanitarian outreach,, and medical education. Prospective assessment of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction is ongoing for objective validation of this delivery model.

34774347#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Assisted living residents are a fragile population with limited access to health care. In recent years,, telemedicine has developed in several specialties,, including ophthalmology. The main objective of our study is the validation of an ophthalmology telemedicine protocol in assisted living facilities.
34774347#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#This is a retrospective,, multicentric,, descriptive study including 4 assisted living facilities in the Rennes area. An ophthalmic technician examined residents for one half-day per week. The examination was performed directly in the patient's room,, in bed or in a chair,, with portable equipment. An ophthalmologist from our service interpreted the results remotely on a deferred basis within 7 days. Appropriate medical or surgical care was then offered to the patient depending on the diagnosis.
34774347#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We included 113 residents. A complete,, interpretable examination was achieved in 84.1% of cases. One or more ophthalmic conditions were diagnosed in 57.5% of the residents. Of the residents who were then seen at the university medical center,, 65% underwent a scheduled surgical procedure or laser. Visual acuity was significantly improved subsequent to the telemedicine encounter.
34774347#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The success rate of a complete,, interpretable examination allows us to now validate our nursing home examination procedure. In addition to bringing a large amount of initially unknown information to the medical and paramedical staff of the structure,, ophthalmology telemedicine allows for a significant improvement in visual acuity.
34774347#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This project validated the feasibility of ophthalmology telemedicine in an assisted living setting. This protocol may also be applicable to other health care settings (penitentiaries,, mental health institutions,, etc.).

34891758#ABSTRACT##The Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy is the most capable therapy against Obstruction Sleep Apnea (OSA). PAP therapy prevents the narrowing and collapsing of the soft tissues of the upper airway. A patient diagnosed with OSA is expected to use their CPAP machines every night for at least more than 4h for experiencing any clinical improvement. However,, for the last two decades,, trials were carried out to improve compliance and understand factors impacting compliance,, but there were not enough conclusive results. With the advent of big data analytic and real-time monitoring,, new opportunities open up to tackle this compliance issue. This paper's significant contribution is a novel framework that blends multiple external verification and validation carried out by different healthcare stakeholders. We provide a systematic verification and validation process to push towards explainable data analytic and automatic learning processes. We also present a complete mHealth solution that includes two mobile applications. The first application is for delivering tailored interventions directly to the patients. The second application is bound to different healthcare stakeholders for the verification and validation process.
35303895#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Using participatory methods to engage end-users in the development and design of eHealth is important to understand and incorporate their needs and context. Within participatory research,, recent social distancing practice has forced a transition to digital communication platforms,, a setting that warrants deeper understanding. The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of,, and evaluate a digital co-creation process for developing an eHealth tool for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
35303895#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The co-creation was guided by Participatory appreciative action and reflection,, where a convenience sample (n?=?17),, including persons with COPD,, health care professionals,, relatives and a patient organization representative participated in six digital workshops. User instructions,, technical equipment,, and skilled support were provided if necessary. Workshops centred around different topics,, with pre-recorded films,, digital lectures and home assignments to up-skill participants. Process validity,, experiences and ownership in the co-creation process were evaluated by repeated respondent validation,, member checking,, questionnaires and by assessing attendance. Data was analysed quantitatively or qualitatively as appropriate.
35303895#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The co-creators were in general satisfied with the digital format of the workshops. Mean attendance and perceived engagement in workshops was high and the experience described as enjoyable. Engagement was facilitated by up-skilling activities and discussions in small groups. Few had used digital communication previously,, and feelings ranging from excitement to concern were expressed initially. Technical issues,, mainly audio related,, were resolved with support. At completion,, skills using equipment and digital platform surpassed expectations. Few disadvantages with the digital format were identified,, and advantages included reduced travel,, time efficiency and reduced infection risk.

35303895#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Experiences of digital co-creation were overwhelmingly positive,, despite initial barriers related to computer naivety and use of digital equipment and platforms. The high level of satisfaction,, engagement,, attendance rates,, and agreement between individual and group views suggests that a digital co-creation process is a feasible method. Several important success factors were identified,, such as the provision of information and education on discussion topics in advance of workshops,, as well as the smaller group discussions during workshops. The knowledge gained herein will be useful for future digital co-creation processes.

34703974#ABSTRACT##The development of novel digital endpoints (NDEs) using digital health technologies (DHTs) may provide opportunities to transform drug development. It requires a multidisciplinary,, multi-study approach with strategic planning and a regulatory-guided pathway to achieve regulatory and clinical acceptance. Many NDEs have been explored; however,, success has been limited. To advance industry use of NDEs to support drug development,, we outline a theoretical,, methodological study as a use-case proposal to describe the process and considerations when developing and obtaining regulatory acceptance for an NDE to assess sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA patients often suffer joint pain,, fatigue,, and sleep disturbances (SDs). Although many researchers have investigated the mobility of joint functions using wearable technologies,, the research of SD in RA has been limited due to the availability of suitable technologies. We proposed measuring the improvement of sleep as the novel endpoint for an anti-TNF therapy and described the meaningfulness of the measure,, considerations of tool selection,, and the design of clinical validation. The recommendations from the FDA patient-focused drug development guidance,, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) pathway for developing novel endpoints from DHTs,, and the V3 framework developed by the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) have been incorporated in the proposal. Regulatory strategy and engagement pathways are also discussed.

19914019#ABSTRACT##Teleradiology aims to even radiologists' workload,, ensure on-call services,, reduce waiting lists,, consult other specialists and cut costs. Cross-border teleradiology widens this scope beyond the country borders. However,, the new service should not reduce the quality of radiology. Quality and trust are key factors in establishment of teleradiology. Additionally there are organizational,, technical,, legal,, security and linguistic issues influencing the service. Herein,, we have used experiences from two partially European Union funded telemedicine projects to evaluate factors affecting cross-border teleradiology. Clinical partners from Czech Republic,, Denmark,, Estonia,, Finland,, Lithuania and the Netherlands went through 649 radiology test cases in two different teleradiology projects to build trust and agree about the report structure. Technical set-up was established using secure Internet data transfer,, streaming technology,, integration of workflows and creating structured reporting tool to overcome language barriers. The biggest barrier to overcome in cross-border teleradiology was the language issue. Establishment of the service was technically and semantically successful but limited to knee and hip X-ray examinations only because the structured reporting tool did not cover any other anatomical regions yet. Special attention has to be paid to clinical quality and trust between partners in cross-border teleradiology. Our experience shows that it is achievable. Legal,, security and financial aspects are not covered in this paper because today they differ country by country. There is however an European Union level harmonization process started to enable cross-border eHealth in general.

30400587#ABSTRACT##In recent years,, a number of proposals for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring based on mobile systems have been delivered. We propose here an STM32F-microcontroller-based ECG mobile system providing both long-term (several weeks) Holter monitoring and 12-lead ECG recording,, according to the clinical standard requirements for these kinds of recordings,, which in addition can yield further digital compression at stages close to the acquisition. The system can be especially useful in rural areas of developing countries,, where the lack of specialized medical personnel justifies the introduction of telecardiology services,, and the limitations of coverage and bandwidth of cellular networks require the use of efficient signal compression systems. The prototype was implemented using a small architecture,, with a 16-bits-per-sample resolution. We also used a low-noise instrumentation amplifier TI ADS1198,, which has a multiplexer and an analog-to-digital converter (16 bits and 8 channels) connected to the STM32F processor,, the architecture of which incorporates a digital signal processing unit and a floating-point unit. On the one hand,, the system portability allows the user to take the prototype in her/his pocket and to perform an ECG examination,, either in 12-lead controlled conditions or in Holter monitoring,, according to the required clinical scenario. An app in the smartphone is responsible for giving the users a friendly interface to set up the system. On the other hand,, electronic health recording of the patients are registered in a web application,, which in turn allows them to connect to the Internet from their cellphones,, and the ECG signals are then sent though a web server for subsequent and ubiquitous analysis by doctors at any convenient terminal device. In order to determine the quality of the received signals,, system testing was performed in the three following scenarios: (1) The prototype was connected to the patient and the signals were subsequently stored; (2) the prototype was connected to the patient and the data were subsequently transferred to the cellphone; (3) the prototype was connected to the patient,, and the data were transferred to the cellphone and to the web via the Internet. An additional benchmarking test with expert clinicians showed the clinical quality provided by the system. The proposed ECG system is the first step and paves the way toward mobile cardiac monitors in terms of compatibility with the electrocardiographic practice,, including the long-term monitoring,, the usability with 12 leads,, and the possibility of incorporating signal compression at the early stages of the ECG acquisition.

27822871#ABSTRACT##We validated a survey tool to test the readiness of oral health professionals for teledentistry (TD). The survey tool,, the University of Calgary Health Telematics Unit's Practitioner Readiness Assessment Tool (PRAT) gathered information about the participants' beliefs,, attitudes and readiness for TD before and after a teledentistry training program developed for a rural state in the Mid-Western United States. Ninety-three dental students,, oral health and other health professionals participated in the TD training program and responded to the survey. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess statistical differences in the change in the readiness rating before and after the training. Principal Components Analysis identified a three factor structure for the PRAT tool: Attitudes/ Attributes of Personnel; Motivation to Change and Institutional Resources. Overall,, the evaluation demonstrated a positive change in all trainees' attitudes following the training sessions,, with the majority of trainees acknowledging a positive impact of the training on their readiness for teledentistry.
27350515#ABSTRACT##The presented study covers the evaluation of ratings of a set of 1080 applications classified as "top apps" for the two categories "Medicine" and "Health &amp; Fitness" as they are available on Google's Play Store. Within the evaluation,, the manifest files and source code of the applications were analyzed in order to reveal whether the requested set of permissions correspond to the ones really utilized by the apps and whether they surpass what is necessary. For many apps,, the declarations in the manifest file do not match what is specified in the source code,, raising the question of whether this may be an indication of questionable app quality with a potentially negative impact on the safety and reliability of mHealth related apps.

34806993#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Video electroencephalography recordings,, routinely used in epilepsy monitoring units,, are the gold standard for monitoring epileptic seizures. However,, monitoring is also needed in the day-to-day lives of people with epilepsy,, where video electroencephalography is not feasible. Wearables could fill this gap by providing patients with an accurate log of their seizures.
34806993#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Although there are already systems available that provide promising results for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs),, research in this area is often limited to detection from 1 biosignal modality or only during the night when the patient is in bed. The aim of this study is to provide evidence that supervised machine learning can detect TCSs from multimodal data in a new data set during daytime and nighttime.

34806993#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An extensive data set of biosignals from a multimodal watch worn by people with epilepsy was recorded during their stay in the epilepsy monitoring unit at 2 European clinical sites. From a larger data set of 243 enrolled participants,, those who had data recorded during TCSs were selected,, amounting to 10 participants with 21 TCSs. Accelerometry and electrodermal activity recorded by the wearable device were used for analysis,, and seizure manifestation was annotated in detail by clinical experts. Ten accelerometry and 3 electrodermal activity features were calculated for sliding windows of variable size across the data. A gradient tree boosting algorithm was used for seizure detection,, and the optimal parameter combination was determined in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on a training set of 10 seizures from 8 participants. The model was then evaluated on an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from the remaining 2 participants. To assess specificity,, we additionally analyzed data from up to 29 participants without TCSs during the model evaluation.
34806993#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the leave-one-participant-out cross-validation,, the model optimized for sensitivity could detect all 10 seizures with a false alarm rate of 0.46 per day in 17.3 days of data. In a test set of 11 out-of-sample TCSs,, amounting to 8.3 days of data,, the model could detect 10 seizures and produced no false positives. Increasing the test set to include data from 28 more participants without additional TCSs resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.19 per day in 78 days of wearable data.
34806993#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We show that a gradient tree boosting machine can robustly detect TCSs from multimodal wearable data in an original data set and that even with very limited training data,, supervised machine learning can achieve a high sensitivity and low false-positive rate. This methodology may offer a promising way to approach wearable-based nonconvulsive seizure detection.

36752194#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Rasch analysis helped to identify that TeleWrite is composed of three separate constructs for rate,, accuracy,, and fluency. All Infit/Outfit mean square (MNSQ) values fell within acceptable ranges of 0.5 to 1.7 logits. Separation analysis indicated lower but acceptable person separation values for rate (0.68-0.76) and fluency (0.61-0.73),, but accuracy scales were in the poor-fair range (0.20-0.60),, given sample limitations.
36752194#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#TeleWrite is comprised of three separate constructs,, showed a good fit with the Rasch model,, indicated strong construct and internal validity,, and moderate ability to reliably separate abilities of students in terms of handwriting skills.

36361408#ABSTRACT##Teledermatology has given dermatologists a tool to track patients' responses to therapy using images. Virtual assistants,, the programs that interact with users through text or voice messages,, could be used in teledermatology to enhance the interaction of the tool with the patients and healthcare professionals and the overall impact of the medication and quality of life of patients. As such,, this work aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using a virtual assistant for teledermatology and its impact on the quality of life. We conducted surveys with the participants and measured the usability of the system with the System Usability Scale (SUS). A total of 34 participants (30 patients diagnosed with moderate-severe psoriasis and 4 healthcare professionals) were included in the study. The measurement of the improvement of quality of life was done by analyzing Psoriasis Quality of Life (PSOLIFE) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires. The results showed that,, on average,, the quality of life improved (from 63.8 to 64.8 for PSOLIFE (with a p-value of 0.66 and an effect size of 0.06) and 4.4 to 2.8 for DLQI (with a p-value of 0.04 and an effect size of 0.31)). Patients also used the virtual assistant to do 52 medical consultations. Moreover,, the usability is above average,, with a SUS score of 70.1. As supported by MMAS-8 results,, adherence also improved slightly. Our work demonstrates the improvement of the quality of life with the use of a virtual assistant in teledermatology,, which could be attributed to the sense of security or peace of mind the patients get as they can contact their dermatologists directly within the virtual assistant-integrated system.

31112461#ABSTRACT##Tele-(remote) rehabilitation is attracting increased attention from society,, including the research community and commercial marketplace with an estimated global market value of $160 billion. Meanwhile,, mobile device-based healthcare ("mHealth") has appeared as a revolutionary approach to tele-rehabilitation practice. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on smartphone-based systems designed for remote facilitation of physical rehabilitation. A total of 74 documents from Web of Science search results were reviewed. Systems were classified based on target medical conditions,, and a taxonomy of technology was created along with identification of monitored activities. Beyond monitoring,, some systems also provide patient-caregiver communication and progress management functions. The review identifies major research interests in stroke,, cardiac disease,, balance impairment and joint/limb rehabilitation; however,, there is a lack of attention to other diseases. There are also few systems that have computerized existing clinical tests. On the basis of the review,, design recommendations are formulated to encourage implementation of advanced functionalities,, usability considerations,, and system validation based on clinical evidence. Results of this study may help researchers and companies to design functions and interactions of smartphone-based rehabilitation systems or to select technology.

31438077#ABSTRACT##Despite similar policy goals,, the adoption of eHealth practices took different paths in Austria (AT),, Switzerland (CH),, and Germany (GER). We seek to provide a rigorous analysis of the current state of hospitals by focusing on three key eHealth areas: electronic patient records (EPR),, health information exchange (HIE),, electronic patient communication. For validation and in order to gain better contextual insight we applied a mixed method approach by combining survey results from clinical directors with qualitative interview data from eHealth experts of all three countries. Across countries,, EPR adoption rates were reported highest (AT: 52%,, CH: 78%,, GER: 50%),, HIE-rates were partly lower (AT: 52%,, CH: 14%,, GER: 17%),, and electronic patient communication was reported lowest overall (AT: 17%,, CH: 8%,, GER: 19%). Amongst others,, results indicate patient awareness about eHealth to be equally weak across countries,, which thus may be an important focal point of future policy initiatives.

22232388#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The goal of this study was to compare clinical and research-based cochlear implant (CI) measures using telehealth versus traditional methods.
22232388#ABSTRACT#METHOD#This prospective study used an ABA design (A = laboratory,, B = remote site). All measures were made twice per visit for the purpose of assessing within-session variability. Twenty-nine adult and pediatric CI recipients participated. Measures included electrode impedance,, electrically evoked compound action potential thresholds,, psychophysical thresholds using an adaptive procedure,, map thresholds and upper comfort levels,, and speech perception. Subjects completed a questionnaire at the end of the study.
22232388#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Results for all electrode-specific measures revealed no statistically significant differences between traditional and remote conditions. Speech perception was significantly poorer in the remote condition,, which was likely due to the lack of a sound booth. In general,, subjects indicated that they would take advantage of telehealth options at least some of the time,, if such options were available.
22232388#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Results from this study demonstrate that telehealth is a viable option for research and clinical measures. Additional studies are needed to investigate ways to improve speech perception at remote locations that lack sound booths and to validate the use of telehealth for pediatric services (e.g.,, play audiometry),, sound-field threshold testing,, and troubleshooting equipment.

34517896#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The access to empirically-supported treatments for common mental disorders in children and adolescents is often limited. Mental health apps might extend service supplies,, as they are deemed to be cost-efficient,, scalable and appealing for youth. However,, little is known about the quality of available apps. Therefore,, we aimed to systematically evaluate current mobile-based interventions for pediatric anxiety,, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
34517896#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Systematic searches were conducted in Google Play Store and Apple App Store to identify relevant apps. To be eligible for inclusion,, apps needed to be: (1) designed to target either anxiety,, depression or PTSD in youth (0-18 years); (2) developed for children,, adolescents or caregivers; (3) provided in English or German; (4) operative after download. The quality of eligible apps was assessed with two standardized rating systems (i.e.,, Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and ENLIGHT) independently by two reviewers.

34517896#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, the searches revealed 3806 apps,, with 15 mental health apps (0.39%) fulfilling our inclusion criteria. The mean overall scores suggested a moderate app quality (MARS: M?=?3.59,, SD?=?0.50; ENLIGHT: M?=?3.22,, SD?=?0.73). Moreover,, only one app was evaluated in an RCT. The correlation of both rating scales was high (r?=?.936; p?<?.001),, whereas no significant correlations were found between rating scales and user ratings (p > .05).
34517896#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our results point to a rather poor overall app quality,, and indicate an absence of scientific-driven development and lack of methodologically sound evaluation of apps. Thus,, future high-quality research is required,, both in terms of theoretically informed intervention development and assessment of mental health apps in RCTs. Furthermore,, institutionalized best-practices that provide central information on different aspects of apps (e.g.,, effectiveness,, safety,, and data security) for patients,, caregivers,, stakeholders and mental health professionals are urgently needed.

30672742#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Evaluating the quality of mobile health apps for weight loss and weight management is important to understand whether these can be used for obesity prevention and treatment. Recent reviews call for more research on multidimensional aspects of app quality,, especially involving end users,, as there are already many expert reviews on this domain. However,, no quantitative study has investigated how laypersons see popular apps for weight management and perceive different dimensions of app quality.
30672742#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to explore how laypersons evaluate the quality of 6 free weight management apps (My Diet Coach,, SparkPeople,, Lark,, MyFitnessPal,, MyPlate,, and My Diet Diary),, which achieved the highest quality ratings in a related and recent expert review.
30672742#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A user-centered study was conducted with 36 employees of a Lebanese university. Participants enrolled in the study on a rolling basis between October 2016 and March 2017. Participants were randomly assigned an app to use for 2 weeks. App quality was evaluated at the end of the trial period using the Mobile App Rating Scale user version (uMARS). uMARS assesses the dimensions of engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, information,, and subjective quality on 5-point scales. Internal consistency and interrater agreement were examined. The associations between uMARS scores and users' demographic characteristics were also explored using nonparametric tests. Analyses were completed in November 2017.
30672742#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, the 6 apps were of moderately good quality (median uMARS score 3.6,, interquartile range [IQR] 0.3). The highest total uMARS scores were achieved by Lark (mean 4.0 [SD 0.5]) and MyPlate (mean 3.8 [SD 0.4]),, which also achieved the highest subjective quality scores (Lark: mean 3.3 [SD 1.4]; MyPlate: mean 3.3 [SD 0.8]). Functionality was the domain with the highest rating (median 3.9,, IQR 0.3),, followed by aesthetics (median 3.7,, IQR 0.5),, information (median 3.7,, IQR 0.1),, and engagement (median 3.3,, IQR 0.2). Subjective quality was judged low (median 2.5,, IQR 0.9). Overall,, subjective quality was strongly and positively related (P<.001) with total uMARS score (?=.75),, engagement (?=.68),, information,, and aesthetics (?=.60) but not functionality (?=.40; P=.02). Higher engagement scores were reported among healthy (P=.003) and obese individuals (P=.03),, who also showed higher total uMARS (P=.04) and subjective quality (P=.05) scores.
30672742#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Although the apps were considered highly functional,, they were relatively weak in engagement and subjective quality scores,, indicating a low propensity of using the apps in the future. As engagement was the subdomain most strongly associated with subjective quality,, app developers and researchers should focus on creating engaging apps,, holding constant the functionality,, aesthetics,, and information quality. The tested apps (in particular Lark and MyPlate) were perceived as more engaging and of higher quality among healthy,, obese individuals,, making them a promising mode of delivery for self-directed interventions promoting weight control among the sampled population or in similar and comparable settings.

16033715#ABSTRACT##This paper validates the integration of a generic real-time wireless telemedicine system utilising Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM),, BLUETOOTH protocol and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for cellular network in clinical practice. In the first experiment,, the system was tested on 24 pacemaker patients at Aalborg Hospital (Denmark),, in order to see if the pacemaker implant would be affected by the system. I the second experiment,, the system was tested on 15 non risky arrhythmia heart patients,, in order to evaluate and validate the system application in clinical practice,, for patient monitoring. Electrocardiograms were selected as the continuously monitored parameter in the present study. The results showed that the system had no negative effects on the pacemaker implants. The experiment results showed,, that in a realistic environment for the patients,, the system had 96.1 % up-time,, 3.2 (kbps) throughput,, 10(-3) (packet/s) Packet Error Rate and 10(-3) (packet/s) Packet Lost Rate. During 24 hours test the network did not respond for 57 minutes,, from which 83.1 % was in the range of 0-3 minutes,, 15.4 % was in the range of 3-5 minutes,, and only 0.7 % of the down-time was > or = 5 and < or = 6 minutes. By a subjective evaluation,, it was demonstrated that the system is applicable and the patients as well as the healthcare personals were highly confident with the system. Moreover,, the patients had high degree of mobility and freedom,, employing the system. In conclusion,, this generic telemedicine system showed a high reliability,, quality and performance,, and the design can provide a basic principle for real-time wireless remote monitoring systems used in clinical practice.

25993374#ABSTRACT##The UK has an increased length of hospital stay in comparison with other European countries,, and the need for further investment in community services is required if patients are to truly receive care closer to home. The increase in hospital admissions over the last few years may be attributed to the ageing UK population,, as well as poor management of long-term conditions. This may be due to variations in the service provision and availability of case managers and community matrons. The poor working relationships and fragmentation of health and social care services remain a significant issue,, despite renewed calls to improve integrated working,, which is considered fundamental to achieving a reduction in avoidable hospital admissions. Mobile working was introduced in the NHS to help reform community health-care practice and improve continuity of care. Among other things,, it provides clinicians with access to electronic patient records in real time,, thus helping to reduce delays in treatment. However,, we have to bear in mind that a number of factors could hinder the reduction in hospital admissions.

35138558#ABSTRACT##This study provided preliminary validation of the Autism Detection in Early Childhood-Virtual (ADEC-V) for telehealth assessment of possible autism. Participants were 121 children (24.79% female) aged 18-47 months who completed telehealth evaluations at a large pediatric hospital in the Midwestern United States between October 2020 and February 2021. The ADEC-V showed good sensitivity (0.82) and specificity (0.78) and was significantly correlated with other ASD symptom measures (i.e.,, CARS-2,, ADI-R). Internal consistency was acceptable (a?=?0.77). These results need replication in a larger and broader sample including more children without ASD. This preliminary validation study identifies the ADEC-V as a promising measure for telehealth ASD assessments in young children.

26679197#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine Applications (MAST) is a health technology assessment (HTA) inspired framework for assessing the effectiveness and contribution to quality of telemedicine applications based on rigorous,, scientific data. This study reports from a study of how it was used and perceived in twenty-one pilots of the European project RENEWING HEALTH (RH). The objectives of RH were to implement large-scale,, real-life test beds for the validation and subsequent evaluation of innovative patient-centered telemedicine services. The study is a contribution to the appraisal of HTA methods.
26679197#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A questionnaire was administered for project leaders of the pilots. It included questions about use and usefulness of MAST for (i) preceding considerations,, (ii) evaluation of outcomes within seven domains,, and (iii) considerations of transferability. Free text spaces allowed for proposals of improvement. The responses covered all pilots. A quantitative summary of use and a qualitative analysis of usefulness were performed.

32646349#ABSTRACT##The use of information and communication technologies have nowadays become  part and parcel of hospital pharmacy practice. Against this background,, it is  hardly surprising that Telepharmacy has sparked the interest of a large number  of stakeholders. In this respect,, the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy has  developed a definition of the concept and outlined the conditions under which  Telepharmacy should operate. It has also shared its institutional stance on the  subject through a position statement that states that Telepharmacy is the  provision of pharmaceutical care at a distance through information and  communication technologies. Telepharmacy practice includes activities such as  therapeutic validation,, drafting of clinical documents,, provision of  pharmaceutical care,, therapeutic follow-up,, adherence monitoring,, drug  education and information,, coordination between healthcare providers and  evaluation of health outcomes. The clinical tasks performed as part of  Telepharmacy practice must adhere to a standardized procedure and revolve  around the patient's clinical record. Access to Telepharmacy must be provided without discrimination. The service comprises four main activities:  pharmacotherapeutic follow-up; patient and caregiver-directed education and information-dissemination; coordination with healthcare providers from the  same or different hospitals; and remote informed home drug delivery. Implementation of Telepharmacy requires an adjustment of human (training and capacity-building) and technological resources (validation,, interoperability,, confidentiality). It must also comply with the laws and regulations in force both  at a regional and a national level. Telepharmacy procedures must also be  adapted to the relevant ethical standards and codes of good practice.  Appropriate indicators must be used to evaluate the performance of  Telepharmacy and its impact on health outcomes. According to Spanish Society  of Hospital Pharmacy Telepharmacy is a necessary complementary tool to  provide specialized pharmaceutical care and thereby improve health outcomes  and maximize patient safety and satisfaction.
26679197#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#MAST was used and considered useful for pilot evaluations. Challenges included problems to scientifically determine alternative service options and outcome within the seven domains. Proposals for improvement included process studies and adding domains of technological usability,, responsible innovation,, health literacy,, behavior change,, caregiver perspectives and motivational issues of professionals.
26679197#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MAST was used according to its structure. Its usefulness in patient centered pilots can be improved by adding new stakeholder groups. Interdependencies between scientific rigor,, resources and timeliness should be addressed. Operational options for improvements include process studies,, literature reviews and sequential mini-HTAs for identification of areas for more elaborate investigations.

28710056#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Social media are a vital link for people with health concerns who find in Web communities a valid and comforting source for information exchange,, debate,, and knowledge enrichment. This aspect is important for people affected by chronic diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS),, who are very well informed about the disease but are vulnerable to hopes of being cured or saved by therapies whose efficacy is not always scientifically proven. To improve health-related coping and social interaction for people with MS,, we created an MS social network (SMsocialnetwork.com) with a medical team constantly online to intervene promptly when false or inappropriate medical information are shared.
28710056#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this study was to assess the impact of SMsocialnetwork.com on the health-related coping and social interaction of people with MS by analyzing areas of interest through a Web-based survey.
28710056#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Referring to previous marketing studies analyzing the online platform's role in targeted health care,, we conducted a 39-item Web-based survey. We then performed a construct validation procedure using a factorial analysis,, gathering together like items of the survey related to different areas of interest such as utility,, proximity,, sharing,, interaction,, solving uncertainty,, suggestion attitude,, and exploration.
28710056#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We collected 130 Web-based surveys. The areas of interest analysis demonstrated that the users positively evaluated SMsocialnetwork.com to obtain information,, approach and solve problems,, and to make decisions (utility: median 4.2); improve feeling of closeness (proximity: median 5); catalyze relationships and text general personal opinions (sharing: median 5.6); get in touch with other users to receive innovative,, effective,, and practical solutions (interaction,, solving uncertainty,, and suggestion attitude medians were respectively: 4.1,, 3,, and 3); and share information about innovative therapeutic approaches and treatment options (suggestion attitude: median: 3.3).
28710056#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#SMsocialnetwork.com was perceived by users to be a useful tool to support health-related coping and social interaction,, and may suggest a new kind of therapeutic alliance between physicians and people with MS.

30498212#ABSTRACT##Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most frequent complications of childbirth and particularly is suited to genetic investigation as it is more homogenous than major depression outside of the perinatal period. We developed an iOS app (PPD ACT) to recruit,, consent,, screen,, and enable DNA collection from women with a lifetime history of PPD to sufficiently power genome-wide association studies. In 1 year,, we recruited 7344 women with a history of PPD and have biobanked 2946 DNA samples from the US. This sample of PPD cases was notably severely affected and within 2 years of their worst episode of PPD. Clinical validation was performed within a hospital setting on a subset of participants and recall validity assessed 6-9 months after initial assessment to ensure reliability of screening tools. Here we detail the creation of the PPD ACT mobile app including design,, ethical,, security,, and deployment considerations. We emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration to correctly implement such a research project. Additionally,, we describe our ability to customize the PPD ACT platform to deploy internationally in order to collect a global sample of women with PPD.

26589638#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Social support plays an important role for the perceived health in people with health problems and chronic diseases. Provision of different kinds of support during the disease trajectory is crucial for many people. Online support is ubiquitous and represents a promising modality for people with chronic diseases. There are no existing instruments that measure various aspects of online support.
26589638#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to create a generic questionnaire regarding health-related support online that can be applied to people with various health problems and illnesses. Additionally,, we wanted to test the questionnaire in a cancer population to assess its adequacy in the context of severe disease.

26589638#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Initial items for the Health Online Support Questionnaire (HOSQ) were inspired by sociologist James House regarding social support. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted in healthy persons or with minor health problems (n=243) on 31 initial items. The scale was reduced to 18 items and the internal consistency and reliability of the scale was examined along with content validity. Further validation was conducted by a confirmatory analysis on the 18-item scale in a cancer population (n=215). In addition,, data on demographics,, health problems experienced,, and Internet use were collected.
26589638#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The exploratory factor analysis on the final 18-item scale resulted in 2 factors. After scrutinizing the content,, these factors were labeled "reading" and "interacting" and they demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach alphas .88 and .77,, respectively). The factors were confirmed in the cancer population. The response pattern revealed expected differences both between the interaction and reading scales and according to age,, gender,, education,, and health problems thereby supporting the validity of the HOSQ.
26589638#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The HOSQ may be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the use of online support for people with health problems,, but the results ought to be replicated in more studies to confirm the results for different diagnoses. If the results of this study are corroborated by future studies,, the HOSQ may be used as a basis for the development of different forms of support on the Internet.

34957461#ABSTRACT##MyPal is a European initiative focusing on the use of the electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) measures to enhance patient engagement in palliative cancer care via digital self-reporting palliative care for patients with cancer. As a part of its approach,, MyPal also focuses on pediatric patients,, implementing a specific digital health platform including a serious game to facilitate the reporting of the symptoms and overall status regarding their quality of life (QoL). To this end,, the reduction of psychological burden related to frequent reporting,, a.k.a. as "reporting fatigue" has been identified as a priority. In this study,, we present the MyPal-CHILD platform,, emphasizing on the serious game named AquaScouts and its key design decisions,, while also emphasizing on the respective challenges. More specifically,, we provide insights on the participatory design approach applied during the design of the platform and the high-level goals defined based on end-user input. In addition,, the validation process applied before the use of the platform under real-world conditions is also presented. Finally,, we discuss a number of challenges and the prospects of deploying eHealth interventions to support palliative care.

31124467#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of health technology by older people is coming increasingly in focus with the demographic changes. Health information technology is generally perceived as an important factor in enabling increased quality of life and reducing the cost of care for this group. Age-appropriate design and facilitation of technology adoption are important to ensure functionality and removal of various barriers to usage. Development of assessment tools and instruments for evaluating older persons' technology adoption and usage as well as measuring the effects of the interventions are of high priority. Both usability and acceptance of a specific technology or service are important factors in evaluating the impact of a health information technology intervention. Psychometric measures are seldom included in evaluations of health technology. However,, basic attitudes and sentiments toward technology (eg,, technophilia) could be argued to influence both the level of satisfaction with the technology itself as well as the perception of the health intervention outcome.
31124467#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study is to develop a reduced and refined instrument for measuring older people's attitudes and enthusiasm for technology based on relevant existing instruments for measuring technophilia. A requirement of the new instrument is that it should be short and simple to make it usable for evaluation of health technology for older people.
31124467#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Initial items for the TechPH questionnaire were drawn from a content analysis of relevant existing technophilia measure instruments. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted in a random selection of persons aged 65 years or older (N=374) on eight initial items. The scale was reduced to six items,, and the internal consistency and reliability of the scale were examined. Further validation was made by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
31124467#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#/df=2.65,, comparative fit index=0.97,, adjusted goodness-of-fit index=0.95,, root mean square error of approximation=0.067,, standardized root mean square residual=0.036).
31124467#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The construed TechPH score showed expected relations to external real-world criteria,, and the two factors showed interesting internal relations. Different technophilia personality traits distinguish clusters with different behaviors of adaptation as well as usage of new technology. Whether there is an independent association with the TechPH score against outcomes in health technology projects needs to be shown in further studies. The instrument must also be validated in different contexts,, such as other countries.

24819853#ABSTRACT##Implementing new technology in the laboratory can improve processes and patient care,, but compliance with regulatory requirements can be a significant hurdle to clear. This study provides a detailed procedure to address user training,, competency assessment,, and internal validation of telecytopathology simultaneously,, while fulfilling regulatory requirements set forth by the College of American Pathologists and CLIA '88. Six pathologists participated in this study. Methods and materials used included a blind correlation study between diagnoses rendered via telecytopathology and via direct microscopy on 10 finalized fine needle aspiration (FNA) cases. The first step of this procedure involved each pathologist to render a diagnosis for each specimen using telecytopathology. The second step was to allow each pathologist to diagnose each specimen via direct microscopic review after a wait period of at least 6 weeks. The diagnoses rendered via telecytopathology were then compared to both the established final diagnoses and the secondary direct microscopic review diagnoses to examine interpathologist and intrapathologist reproducibility with a passing rate of 90% or better. Results of the study yielded an average concordance rate of 96.67% for interpathologist reproducibility and 95% for intrapathologist reproducibility across all participating pathologists. All participants passed the assessment with a rate of 90% or better,, proving evidence of competency. This study confirmed user competency and validated telecytopathology as an effective tool for examining and diagnosing cytology FNA specimens remotely. It also satisfied regulatory compliance requirements to ensure high quality of diagnostic testing and patient care.
26262011#ABSTRACT##Studies on the validation of minimum data sets from international information standards have drawn the attention of the academic community to the identification of necessary requirements for the development of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The primary motivation of such studies is the development of systems using archetypes. The aim of this study was to validate the minimum data set that should be used when constructing an archetyped EHR for prenatal care applications in telehealth. In order to achieve this,, a data validation tool was built and used by nine expert obstetricians. The statistical analysis employed was the percentage of agreement and the content validity index. The study was conducted in three steps: 1) Literature review,, 2)Instrument development,, and 3) Validation of the minimum data set. Of the 179 evaluated pieces of data,, 157 of them were validated to be included in the archetyped record of the first prenatal consultation,, while 56 of them were allocated for the subsequent consultation record. The benefit of this research is the standardization (data validation for an archetyped system) of prenatal care,, with the perspective of employing,, both nationally and internationally,, an archtyped telehealth system.

35811720#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#The Withings Scanwatch (Withings SA,, Issy les Moulineaux,, France) offers automated analysis of the QTc. We aimed to compare automated QTc-measurements using a single lead ECG of a novel smartwatch (Withings Scanwatch,, SW-ECG) with manual-measured QTc from a nearly simultaneously recorded 12-lead ECG.
35811720#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We enrolled consecutive patients referred to a tertiary hospital for cardiac workup in a prospective,, observational study. The QT-interval of the 12-lead ECG was manually interpreted by two blinded,, independent cardiologists through the tangent-method. Bazett's formula was used to calculate QTc. Results were compared using the Bland-Altman method.
35811720#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 317 patients (48% female,, mean age 63 ± 17 years) were enrolled. HR-,, QRS-,, and QT-intervals were automatically calculated by the SW in 295 (93%),, 249 (79%),, and 177 patients (56%),, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of SW-ECG for detection of QTc-intervals = 460 ms (women) and = 440 ms (men) as quantified by the area under the curve was 0.91 and 0.89. The Bland-Altman analysis resulted in a bias of 6.6 ms [95% limit of agreement (LoA) -59 to 72 ms] comparing automated QTc-measurements (SW-ECG) with manual QTc-measurement (12-lead ECG). In 12 patients (6.9%) the difference between the two measurements was greater than the LoA.
35811720#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In this clinical validation of a direct-to-consumer smartwatch we found fair to good agreement between automated-SW-ECG QTc-measurements and manual 12-lead-QTc measurements. The SW-ECG was able to automatically calculate QTc-intervals in one half of all assessed patients. Our work shows,, that the automated algorithm of the SW-ECG needs improvement to be useful in a clinical setting.

27919395#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop and validate the PAtient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT): a survey instrument to quantitatively assess patient trust in a telemedicine service.
27919395#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The PATAT is a valid means to assess patient trust in a telemedicine service and can be used to benchmark such a service or to elicit redesign input.
20634171#ABSTRACT##This evaluation investigates the quality of digital skin images submitted by patients,, and evaluates the feasibility of making a diagnosis and suggesting therapeutic intervention without direct physical examination. A broad sample of patients who called the Swiss Centre for Telemedicine for a skin problem,, were invited to receive an oral and an electronic tutorial and to submit digital images of the lesion. All patients (N = 46) who submitted digital images of their skin problems during a two week period were included in the evaluation. Images were electronically transferred to a dermatologist from an independent office. Seventy-four percent of image sets contained focused images,, and 72% contained adequate detail. Making a specific diagnosis was feasible in 67% of cases,, and the dermatologist was able to narrow down the differential diagnosis in an additional 17%. Recommending therapeutic interventions was possible for the skin problems of 70% of patients. In conclusion,, most digital skin images submitted by patients are of sufficient quality,, and establishing a dermatological diagnosis is feasible in most cases. These results contribute to the validation of teledermatological processes based on patient-supplied skin images.
27919395#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#For many eServices,, end-user trust is a crucial prerequisite for use. For the telemedicine context however,, knowledge about the coming about and measurement of end-user trust is scarce.
27919395#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Informed by focus groups,, we developed a survey that includes measurement scales for the following factors: trust in the care organization,, care professional,, treatment,, and technology,, as well as a scale that assesses a holistic view on trust in the telemedicine service. The survey was completed by 795 patients that use a telemedicine application to manage their anticoagulation treatment. Data were analyzed by means of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).
27919395#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=0.68). Trust in healthcare professionals and the treatment had a small effect on overall trust,, while trust in the technology displayed a large effect. Trust in the care organization did not result in a significant effect on overall trust.

23920559#ABSTRACT##eHealth indicator and benchmarking activities are rapidly increasing nationally and internationally. The work is rarely based on a transparent methodology for indicator definition. This article describes first results of testing an indicator methodology for defining eHealth indicators,, which was reported at the Medical Informatics Europe conference in 2012. The core elements of the methodology are illustrated,, demonstrating validation of each of them in the context of Nordic eHealth Indicator work. Validation proved the importance of conducting each of the steps of the methodology,, with several scientific as well as practical outcomes. The article is based on a report to be published by the Nordic Council of Ministers [4].
21233053#ABSTRACT##We propose a unifying framework for efficient encoding,, transmission,, and quality assessment of atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound video. The approach is based on a spatially varying encoding scheme,, where video-slice quantization parameters are varied as a function of diagnostic significance. Video slices are automatically set based on a segmentation algorithm. They are then encoded using a modified version of H.264/AVC flexible macroblock ordering (FMO) technique that allows variable quality slice encoding and redundant slices (RSs) for resilience over error-prone transmission channels. We evaluate our scheme on a representative collection of ten ultrasound videos of the carotid artery for packet loss rates up to 30%. Extensive simulations incorporating three FMO encoding methods,, different quantization parameters,, and different packet loss scenarios are investigated. Quality assessment is based on a new clinical rating system that provides independent evaluations of the different parts of the video (subjective). We also use objective video-quality assessment metrics and estimate their correlation to the clinical quality assessment of plaque type. We find that some objective quality assessment measures computed over the plaque video slices gave very good correlations to mean opinion scores (MOSs). Here,, MOSs were computed using two medical experts. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves enhanced performance in noisy environments,, while at the same time achieving significant bandwidth demands reductions,, providing transmission over 3G (and beyond) wireless networks.

16375798#ABSTRACT##Integrity of patient information,, from both a quality and a security perspective,, is critical to patient care. In the UK,, the information governance initiative of the National Health Service (NHS) provides a framework to monitor and control the management of confidential patient data. Information governance standards grew out of the Data Accreditation Programme,, first proposed in the 1998 NHS document Information for Health. The Data Accreditation Programme was based on a three-stage assessment of data quality in acute hospitals. Stage one required internal review of policy and procedures for data input into computerized patient administration systems. Stage two involved an external audit to verify compliance with the standards. Stage three mandated audits of data outputs,, focusing on clinical coding quality. Before stage three of the programme was fully implemented,, the standards were incorporated into the information governance initiative,, in which standards were expanded to include primary care and other health-care settings. These standards address many information management issues,, including security and data quality,, which are key concerns in telemedicine and e-health applications. Compliance is essential for the successful implementation of the NHS Care Records Service,, which will allow sharing of electronically stored patient information across the UK.

In addition to age and EDSS score,, each patient's current disease status (disease activity,, symptoms,, and its impacts on daily life) was collected while completing the draft tool. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined optimal cut-off values (sensitivity and specificity) for the classification of RRMS and SPMS.
32049062#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Twenty neurologists completed the draft tool for 198 patients. Mean scores for patients with RRMS (n=89),, transitioning to SPMS (n=47),, and SPMS (n=62) were 38.1 (SD 12.5),, 55.2 (SD 11.1),, and 69.6 (SD 12.0),, respectively (P<.001,, each between-groups comparison). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) including and excluding EDSS were for RRMS (including) AUC 0.91,, 95% CI 0.87-0.95,, RRMS (excluding) AUC 0.88,, 95% CI 0.84-0.93,, SPMS (including) AUC 0.91,, 95% CI 0.86-0.95,, and SPMS (excluding) AUC 0.86,, 95% CI 0.81-0.91. In the algorithm with EDSS,, the optimal cut-off values were =51.6 for RRMS patients (sensitivity=0.83; specificity=0.82) and =58.9 for SPMS patients (sensitivity=0.82; specificity=0.84). The optimal cut-offs without EDSS were =46.3 and =57.8 and resulted in similar high sensitivity and specificity (0.76-0.86). The draft tool showed excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=.95).
32049062#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MSProDiscuss tool differentiated RRMS patients from SPMS patients with high sensitivity and specificity. In clinical practice,, it may be a useful tool to evaluate early,, subtle signs of MS disease progression indicating the evolution of RRMS to SPMS. MSProDiscuss will help assess the current level of progression in an individual patient and facilitate a more informed physician-patient discussion.

37033078#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The progression into the Digital Age has brought an array of novel skill requirements. Unlike traditional literacy,, there are currently few measures that can reliably measure eHealth literacy. The Transactional Model of eHealth Literacy and subsequent Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument may provide a feasible option for measuring eHealth literacy.
37033078#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This instrument has yet to be validated,, which is the aim of this study. In particular,, this article was conducted to validate the TeHLI to see which components of the tool (how many and which components included) would be the best fit statistically and whether the tool applies to groups of different characteristics.
37033078#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted an online cross-sectional study among 236 Vietnamese young people. A exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the best fit model of the Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument. A confirmatory factor analysis tested measurement invariance at four levels: configural,, metric,, scalar,, and strict invariance. Only metric invariance was partially invariant,, while the rest tested fully invariant. Even with partial metric invariance,, there is reason to assume that functional,, communicative,, critical,, and translational eHealth literacy (the four levels according to the transactional model) are consistently measured when deploying the Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument across groups.

37033078#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The study findings substantiate that the most optimal composition of the TeHLI consists of four factors: functional,, communicative,, critical,, and translational eHealth literacy,, with RMSEA = 0.116; CFI = 0.907,, and the highest internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.91,, 0.92,, 0.88,, and 0.92 for each factor respectively). After using measurement invariance,, that gender,, education,, marital status,, age,, location,, and household economy do not influence the way participants to respond to the TeHLI to the point that would introduce measurement bias. In other word,, using TeHLI across population groups should not produce error margins that substantially differ from each other.
37033078#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study suggests the instrument can be used for comparisons across groups and has the potential to generate high-quality data usable for informing change agents as to whether a particular population is proficient enough to adopt novel eHealth innovations.

34513775#ABSTRACT##Most mental disorders emerge before the age of 25 years and,, if left untreated,, have the potential to lead to considerable lifetime burden of disease. Many services struggle to manage high demand and have difficulty matching individuals to timely interventions due to the heterogeneity of disorders. The technological implementation of clinical staging for youth mental health may assist the early detection and treatment of mental disorders. We describe the development of a theory-based automated protocol to facilitate the initial clinical staging process,, its intended use,, and strategies for protocol validation and refinement. The automated clinical staging protocol leverages the clinical validation and evidence base of the staging model to improve its standardization,, scalability,, and utility by deploying it using Health Information Technologies (HIT). Its use has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and transform existing care pathways,, but further validation and evaluation of the tool in real-world settings is needed.

18274557#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#This study compared digital images from a portable slit-lamp camera with 35 mm slit-lamp photographs and traditional ophthalmic assessments in anterior segment disorder's detection.
18274557#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 196 patients (392 eyes) were recruited from an anterior segment ophthalmology clinic. Each patient underwent an examination by an anterior segment ophthalmologist. Two to three standardized views of 640 x 480 pixels digital images (portable digital slit-lamp camera) and 35 mm photographic slides (Zeiss slit-lamp camera) were taken after the examination. The same ophthalmologist reviewed these images in a masked fashion. Two other masked graders also assessed the digital images. The presence or absence of 33 specific findings was noted at each examination.
18274557#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Digital images showed moderate to excellent agreement to clinical findings (kappa 0.45-0.82) in areas other than lid pathologies. Lens findings from digital images had moderate to good agreement with the clinical gold standard (unweighted kappa 0.43-0.65,, sensitivity 59-77%,, specificity 86-94%). Gross cornea signs were well detected with digital images,, (kappa 0.72-0.85,, sensitivity 67-100%,, specificity 98-99). More subtle corneal,, conjunctival and lid abnormalities were not identified well. The statistical figures were very similar to the above-mentioned figures when the 35-mm film results were compared to clinical diagnoses. The two image formats showed better agreement when compared to each other than when either is compared with clinical findings.
18274557#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Diagnoses using digital slit-lamp images were comparable to diagnosis using 35 mm photographic slides for some anterior segment abnormalities.

37146371#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE#The Dutch university medical centres (UMC's) are on the forefront when it comes to validation,, implementation and research of telemonitoring. To aid the UMC's in their effort,, the Dutch Government has supported the UMC's by fostering the 'Citrien eHealth program'. This program aims at nationwide implementation and upscaling of telemonitoring via a collaborative network. To quantify the success of this program,, this study aims to provide insights into the current adoption of telemonitoring by health care professionals (HCP) within Dutch UMC's.
37146371#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Based on the evaluation framework as adapted from the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) a cross-sectional study was conducted in all Dutch UMC's. Thirty healthcare professionals (HCPs) per UMC were invited to complete the 23-item Normalization MeAsure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire,, a tool to assess the degree of normalisation of telemonitoring.
37146371#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The over-all response rate was 52.4% (124/240). Over 80% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they understand how telemonitoring affects the nature of their work,, with a mean score of 1.49 (N = 117,, SD 0.74). HCPs reported to believe telemonitoring will become a normal part of their work in the near future (N = 124,, mean = 8.67,, SD = 1.38). Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test,, the difference between current practise and future use of telemonitoring predicts to be statistically significant (Z =  - 7.505,, p = 0.001). Mean scores for appropriate training and sufficient resources are relatively low (2.39 and 2.70 respectively),, indicating a barrier for collective action.
37146371#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This is the first study to assess the implementation of telemonitoring as standard practise across Dutch UMCs. The HCPs in this study are the frontrunners,, believing that telemonitoring will become standard practise in the future despite the fact that it is currently not. Based on the results of this study,, both educational and implementation strategies including practical skills training are highly recommended in order to scale up telemonitoring widely.
32049063#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#(3,,1) was 0.86 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.81 to 0.90,, also indicating good reliability. Bland-Altman analysis showed a difference of 0.175 (0.49),, and limits of agreement ranged from -0.79 to 1.14.
32049063#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The pain level module on the app is highly reliable and interchangeable with the paper VAS version. This tool could potentially help clinicians and researchers precisely assess pain in a simple,, economic way with the use of a ubiquitous technology.

27348761#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There is a need to enforce independent review of mhealth applications in oncology. The economic model could be questioned and the source of funding should be clarified. Meanwhile,, patients and healthcare professionals should remain cautious about applications' contents. Key messages A systematic review was performed to describe the mobile applications related to oncology and it revealed a lack of information on scientific validation and funding. Independent scientific review and the reporting of conflicts of interest should be encouraged. Users,, and all health professionals,, should be aware that health applications,, whatever the quality of their content,, do not actually embrace such an approach.
33119561#ABSTRACT## Trends in telehealth encounters during January-March 2020 (surveillance weeks 1-13) were compared with encounters occurring during the same weeks in 2019. During the first quarter of 2020,, the number of telehealth visits increased by 50%,, compared with the same period in 2019,, with a 154% increase in visits noted in surveillance week 13 in 2020,, compared with the same period in 2019. During January-March 2020,, most encounters were from patients seeking care for conditions other than COVID-19. However,, the proportion of COVID-19-related encounters significantly increased (from 5.5% to 16.2%; p<0.05) during the last 3 weeks of March 2020 (surveillance weeks 11-13). This marked shift in practice patterns has implications for immediate response efforts and longer-term population health. Continuing telehealth policy changes and regulatory waivers might provide increased access to acute,, chronic,, primary,, and specialty care during and after the pandemic.

32049063#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Accurate measurement of pain is required to improve its management and in research. The visual analog scale (VAS) on paper format has been shown to be an accurate,, valid,, reliable,, and reproducible way to measure pain intensity. However,, some limitations should be considered,, some of which can be implemented with the introduction of an electronic VAS version,, suitable to be used both in a tablet and a smartphone.
32049063#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to validate a new method of recording pain level by comparing the traditional paper VAS with the pain level module on the newly designed Interactive Clinics app.
32049063#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A prospective observational cross-sectional study was designed. The sample consisted of 102 participants aged 18 to 65 years. A Force Dial FDK 20 algometer (Wagner Instruments) was employed to induce mild pressure symptoms on the participants' thumbs. Pain was measured using a paper VAS (10 cm line) and the app.

27348761#ABSTRACT#AIM#Mobile applications represent promising tools in management of chronic diseases,, both for patients and healthcare professionals,, and especially in oncology. Among the large number of mobile health (mhealth) applications available in mobile stores,, it could be difficult for users to identify the most relevant ones. This study evaluated the business model and the scientific validation for mobile applications related to oncology.
27348761#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic review was performed over the two major marketplaces. Purpose,, scientific validation,, and source of funding were evaluated according to the description of applications in stores. Results were stratified according to targeted audience (general population/patients/healthcare professionals).
27348761#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Five hundred and thirty-nine applications related to oncology were identified: 46.8% dedicated to healthcare professionals,, 31.5% to general population,, and 21.7% to patients. A lack of information about healthcare professionals' involvement in the development process was noted since only 36.5% of applications mentioned an obvious scientific validation. Most apps were free (72.2%) and without explicit support by industry (94.2%).

31783847#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Application of standards is a way to increase quality in an evaluation study. However,, standards are used insufficiently in eHealth evaluation,, affecting the generalization of the knowledge generated. This study aimed to explore how standards are used in a practical setting of an eHealth evaluation,, and to identify the factors that can hinder their use.
31783847#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The data were collected in a multi-national and interdisciplinary eHealth evaluation study targeted at the elderly people suffering from mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. The study was carried out in four countries and funded by the European Union. The collected data included meeting minutes (n?=?8) and e-mail correspondence (n?=?261) between partners. The chronological sequence of events related to the use of standards was established. Subsequently,, the hindering factors related to the use of standards were identified from the sequence.
31783847#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The use of four standards was described,, reflecting a variety of related processes or barriers that emerge during eHealth evaluation. The processes differed based on the type of the standard. Specifically,, evaluation frameworks were found to be conceptual standards and they were easy to agree upon,, while standardized metrics were more tangible and their use triggered negotiations. Further,, the following factors hindered the use of standards in eHealth evaluations: (1) inadequacy of a standard to address a target population or a disease,, (2) insufficient resources to use a standard,, (3) lack of experience in using a standard,, and (4) lack of validation of a standard in a particular location.
31783847#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Standardization initiatives in eHealth evaluation provide a blueprint for evaluation,, but their practical application is problematic. The practical circumstances of an evaluation study can cause deviations in the standards,, thus producing heterogeneity in the evaluation methodologies.

31349290#ABSTRACT##A potentially useful resource for health promotion and guidance is eHealth. However,, this field also presents challenges,, and one of the most important obstacles is the lack of regulation,, without which citizens including young people may be exposed to misleading or risky information and applications. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of accreditation processes for mobile applications (apps) and websites in European countries,, to determine whether regulation is on the agenda. A survey was conducted in 28 European Member States and 2 European Economic Area countries,, between 2017 and 2018. Twenty-seven responses were collected. Six countries have accreditation processes for apps and eight countries have accreditation processes for websites. However,, processes are fragmented and there is variety within and amongst countries.

28223263#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis requiring long-term treatment with regular monitoring by a rheumatologist to achieve good health outcomes. Since people with RA may wish to monitor their own disease activity with a smartphone app,, it is important to understand the functions and quality of apps for this purpose.
28223263#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of our study was to assess the features and quality of apps to assist people to monitor their RA disease activity by (1) summarizing the available apps,, particularly the instruments used for measurement of RA disease activity; (2) comparing the app features with American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism (ACR and EULAR) guidelines for monitoring of RA disease activity; and (3) rating app quality with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).
28223263#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Systematic searches of the New Zealand iTunes and Google Play app stores were used to identify all apps for monitoring of RA disease activity that could be used by people with RA. The apps were described by both key metadata and app functionality. App adherence with recommendations for monitoring of RA disease activity in clinical practice was evaluated by identifying whether apps included calculation of a validated composite disease activity measure and recorded results for future retrieval. App quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers using the MARS.
26724303#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In a 2-phased study,, an online survey was used to assess nurses' perceptions of intensive care telemedicine,, and a modified 2-round Delphi study was used to identify priority areas of nursing.
26724303#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings can be used to further inform the development of competencies for tele-intensive care nursing,, match the tele-intensive care nursing practice guidelines of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses,, and highlight concepts related to the association's standards for establishing and sustaining healthy work environments.

28223263#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search identified 721 apps in the Google Play store and 216 in the iTunes store,, of which 19 unique apps met criteria for inclusion (8 from both app stores,, 8 iTunes,, and 3 Google Play). In total,, 14 apps included at least one validated instrument measuring RA disease activity; 7 of 11 apps that allowed users to enter a joint count used the standard 28 swollen and tender joint count; 8 apps included at least one ACR and EULAR-recommended RA composite disease activity (CDA) measure; and 10 apps included data storage and retrieval. Only 1 app,, Arthritis Power,, included both an RA CDA measure and tracked data,, but this app did not include the standard 28 tender and swollen joint count. The median overall MARS score for apps was 3.41/5. Of the 6 apps that scored =4/5 on the overall MARS rating,, only 1 included a CDA score endorsed by ACR and EULAR; however,, this app did not have a data tracking function.
28223263#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This review found a lack of high-quality apps for longitudinal assessment of RA disease activity. Current apps fall into two categories: simple calculators primarily for rheumatologists and data tracking tools for people with RA. The latter do not uniformly collect data using validated instruments or composite disease activity measures. There is a need for appropriate,, high-quality apps for use by rheumatologists and patients together in co-management of RA.

23624056#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile Health (mHealth) proposes health care delivering anytime and anywhere. It aims to answer several emerging problems in health services,, including the increasing number of chronic diseases,, high costs on national health services,, and the need to provide direct access to health services,, regardless of time and place. mHealth systems include the use of mobile devices and apps that interact with patients and caretakers. However,, mobile devices present several constraints,, such as processor,, energy,, and storage resource limitations. The constant mobility and often-required Internet connectivity also exposes and compromises the privacy and confidentiality of health information.
23624056#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper presents a proposal,, construction,, performance evaluation,, and validation of a data encryption solution for mobile health apps (DE4MHA),, considering a novel and early-proposed cooperation strategy. The goal was to present a robust solution based on encryption algorithms that guarantee the best confidentiality,, integrity,, and authenticity of users health information. In this paper,, we presented,, explained,, evaluated the performance,, and discussed the cooperation mechanisms and the proposed encryption solution for mHealth apps.
23624056#ABSTRACT#METHODS#First,, we designed and deployed the DE4MHA. Then two studies were performed: (1) study and comparison of symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithms in an mHealth app under a cooperation environment,, and (2) performance evaluation of the DE4MHA. Its performance was evaluated through a prototype using an mHealth app for obesity prevention and cares,, called SapoFit. We then conducted an evaluation study of the mHealth app with cooperation mechanisms and the DE4MHA using real users and a real cooperation scenario. In 5 days,, 5 different groups of 7 students selected randomly agreed to use and experiment the SapoFit app using the 7 devices available for trials.
23624056#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There were 35 users of SapoFit that participated in this study. The performance evaluation of the app was done using 7 real mobile devices in 5 different days. The results showed that confidentiality and protection of the users' health information was guaranteed and SapoFit users were able to use the mHealth app with satisfactory quality. Results also showed that the app with the DE4MHA presented nearly the same results as the app without the DE4MHA. The performance evaluation results considered the probability that a request was successfully answered as a function of the number of uncooperative nodes in the network. The service delivery probability decreased with the increase of uncooperative mobile nodes. Using DE4MHA,, it was observed that performance presented a slightly worse result. The service average was also slightly worse but practically insignificantly different than with DE4MHA,, being considered negligible.
23624056#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This paper proposed a data encryption solution for mobile health apps,, called DE4MHA. The data encryption algorithm DE4MHA with cooperation mechanisms in mobile health allow users to safely obtain health information with the data being carried securely. These security mechanisms did not deteriorate the overall network performance and the app,, maintaining similar performance levels as without the encryption. More importantly,, it offers a robust and reliable increase of privacy,, confidentiality,, integrity,, and authenticity of their health information. Although it was experimented on a specific mHealth app,, SapoFit,, both DE4MHA and the cooperation strategy can be deployed in other mHealth apps.

27016522#ABSTRACT##During the 20 years since US Food and Drug Administration approval of IV tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke,, vascular neurology consultation via telemedicine has contributed to an increased frequency of IV tissue plasminogen activator administration and broadened geographic access to the drug. Nevertheless,, a growing demand for acute stroke coverage persists,, with the greatest disparity found in rural communities underserved by neurologists. To provide efficient and consistent acute care,, formal training in telemedicine during neurovascular fellowship is warranted. Herein,, we describe our experiences incorporating telestroke into the vascular neurology fellowship curriculum and propose recommendations on integrating formal telemedicine training into the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education vascular neurology fellowship.

26724303#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In phase 1,, most of the 1213 respondents agreed to strongly agreed that using tele-intensive care enables them to accomplish tasks more quickly (63%),, improves collaboration (65.9%),, improves job performance (63.6%) and communication (60.4%),, is useful in nursing assessments (60%),, and improves care by providing more time for patient care (45.6%). Benefits of tele-intensive care included ability to detect trends in vital signs,, detect unstable physiological status,, provide medical management,, and enhance patient safety. Barriers included technical problems (audio and video),, interruptions in care,, perceptions of telemedicine as an interference,, and attitudes of staff. In phase 2,, 60 nurses ranked 15 priority areas of care,, including critical thinking skills,, intensive care experience,, skillful communication,, mutual respect,, and management of emergency patient care.
16301772#ABSTRACT##What if clinical quality medical equipment were available to every consumer in a form factor that was inexpensive,, accurate,, and easy to use? What if this equipment provided information that previously was un-measurable or very difficult to measure? What if the physiological state of individuals,, at resolutions measured in thousandths of a second instead of in visits per year,, could be measured easily,, making it possible to ascertain caloric intake and expenditure,, patterns of sleep,, contextual activities such as working-out and driving,, even parameters of mental state and health. What aspect of healthcare would not change? We present a system that is available today that enables this vision. This award-winning multi-channel wearable physiological monitor has enabled the collection of more than 90 million minutes of data in natural settings from thousands of subjects engaged in diverse activities. Data modeling efforts are resulting in applications that present meaningful and actionable information in real-time to users and their designated collaborators (physicians,, family members,, counselors,, coaches,, etc.) We describe the SenseWear system,, its design,, and a summary of validation studies,, current commercial applications,, and ongoing research. This discussion will show how the convergence of design for wearability,, advances in machine learning,, and improvements in wireless technology will manifest the future of health care as personal,, ubiquitous,, and collaborative.

34682518#ABSTRACT##Brain Health is defined as the development and preservation of optimal brain integrity and neural network functioning for a given age. Recent studies have related healthy habits with better maintenance of brain health across the lifespan. As a part of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI),, a mHealth platform has been developed with the purpose of helping people to improve and monitor their healthy habits,, facilitating the delivery of health coaching strategies. A decision support system (DSS),, named Intelligent Coaching Assistant (ICA),, has been developed to ease the work of professional brain health coaches,, helping them design and monitor adherence to multidomain interventions in a more efficient manner. Personalized recommendations are based on users' current healthy habits,, individual preferences,, and motivational aspects. Taking these inputs,, an initial user profile is defined,, and the ICA applies an algorithm for determining the most suitable personalized intervention plan. An initial validation has been done focusing on assessing the feasibility and usability of the solution,, involving 20 participants for three weeks. We conclude that this kind of technology-based intervention is feasible and implementable in real-world settings. Importantly,, the personalized intervention proposal generated by the DSS is feasible and its acceptability and usability are high.

36803677#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious public health concern for older adults and amplified the value of deploying telehealth solutions. The purpose of this study was to investigate telehealth offered by providers among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic.
36803677#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This cross-sectional study analyzed Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,, Winter 2021 COVID-19 Supplement ([Formula: see text]). We identified variables that were associated with telehealth offered by primary care physicians and beneficiaries' access to the Internet through a multivariate classification analysis utilizing Random Forest machine learning techniques.
36803677#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We found that telehealth offered by providers likely increased during the COVID-19 pandemic for older beneficiaries,, providing important access to care for certain subgroups. Policymakers must continue to identify effective means of delivering telehealth services,, modernize the framework of regulatory,, accreditation and reimbursement,, and address disparities in access to telehealth with a particular focus on underserved communities.

The survey response rates for each outcome were 74.86% and 99.55% respectively. The two outcomes were positively correlated ([Formula: see text]). The Our machine learning model predicted the outcomes accurately utilizing 44 variables. Residing area and race/ethnicity were most informative for predicting telehealth coverage,, and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility and income were most informative for predicting Internet access. Other strong correlates included age,, ability to access basic needs and certain mental and physical health conditions. Interactions were found among statuses of residing area,, age,, Medicare Advantage and heart conditions that intensified the disparity of outcomes.

31128890#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Recent technologic advances capable of measuring outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are critical in quantifying value-based care. Traditionally accomplished through office assessments and surveys with variable follow-up,, this strategy lacks continuous and complete data. The primary objective of this study was to validate the feasibility of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) system in terms of the frequency of data interruptions and patient acceptance. Second,, we report pilot data for (1) mobility; (2) knee range of motion,, (3) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs); (4) opioid use; and (5) home exercise program (HEP) compliance.
31128890#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A pilot cohort of 25 patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis was enrolled. Patients downloaded the RPM mobile application preoperatively to collect baseline activity and PROMs data,, and the wearable knee sleeve was paired to the smartphone during admission. The following was collected up to 3 months postoperatively: mobility (step count),, range of motion,, PROMs,, opioid consumption,, and HEP compliance. Validation was determined by acquisition of continuous data and patient tolerance at semistructured interviews 3 months after operation.

37312799#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As the number of individuals suffering from cognitive diseases continues to rise,, dealing with the diminished cognitive function that comes with age has become a serious public health concern. While the use of mobile applications (apps) as digital treatments for cognitive training shows promise,, the analysis of their content and quality remains unclear.
37312799#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to systematically search and assess cognitive training apps using the multidimensional mobile app rating scale (MARS) to rate objective quality and identify critical points.
37312799#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search was conducted on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in February 2022 using the terms "cognitive training" and "cognitive rehabilitation." The cognitive domains provided by each app were analyzed,, and the frequency and percentage according to the apps were obtained. The MARS,, a mHealth app quality rating tool including multidimensional measures,, was used to analyze the quality of the apps. The relationship between the MARS score,, the number of reviews,, and 5-star ratings were examined.

37312799#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 53 apps,, 52 (98 %) included memory function,, 48 (91 %) included attention function,, 24 (45 %) included executive function,, and 19 (36 %) included visuospatial function. The mean (SD) scores of MARS,, 5-star ratings,, and reviews of 53 apps were 3.09 (0.61),, 4.33 (0.30),, and 62,,415.43 (121,,578.77). From the between-section comparison,, engagement (mean 2.97,, SD 0.68) obtained lower scores than functionality (mean 3.18,, SD 0.62),, aesthetics (mean 3.13,, SD 0.72),, and information (mean 3.11,, SD 0.54). The mean quality score and reviews showed a statistically significant association (r = 0.447 and P = .001*). As the number of domains increased,, the mean quality score showed a statistically significant increasing trend (P = .002*).
37312799#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Most apps provided training for the memory and attention domains,, but few apps included executive function or visuospatial domains. The quality of the apps improved significantly when more domains were provided,, and was positively associated with the number of reviews received. These results could be useful for the future development of mobile apps for cognitive training.

30733167#ABSTRACT##Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is often severe,, enduring,, and contributes significantly to chronic disability. A standardized platform for identifying cognitive impairments and measuring treatment effects in cognition is a critical aspect of comprehensive evaluation and treatment for individuals with schizophrenia. In this project,, we developed and tested a suite of ten web-based,, neuroscience-informed cognitive assessments that are designed to enable the interpretation of specific deficits that could signal that an individual is experiencing cognitive difficulties. The assessment suite assays speed of processing,, sustained attention,, executive functioning,, learning and socio-affective processing in the auditory and visual modalities. We have obtained data from 283 healthy individuals who were recruited online and 104 individuals with schizophrenia who also completed formal neuropsychological testing. Our data show that the assessments 1) are acceptable and tolerable to users,, with successful completion in an average of under 40?min; 2) reliably measure the distinct theoretical cognitive constructs they were designed to assess; 3) can discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls with a fair degree of accuracy (AUROC?>?0.70); and 4) have promising construct,, convergent,, and external validity. Further optimization and validation work is in progress to finalize the evaluation process prior to promoting the dissemination of these assessments in real-world settings.

34883995#ABSTRACT##The global population is aging in an unprecedented manner and the challenges for improving the lives of older adults are currently both a strong priority in the political and healthcare arena. In this sense,, preventive measures and telemedicine have the potential to play an important role in improving the number of healthy years older adults may experience and virtual coaching is a promising research area to support this process. This paper presents COLAEVA,, an interactive web application for older adult population clustering and evolution analysis. Its objective is to support caregivers in the design,, validation and refinement of coaching plans adapted to specific population groups. COLAEVA enables coaching caregivers to interactively group similar older adults based on preliminary assessment data,, using AI features,, and to evaluate the influence of coaching plans once the final assessment is carried out for a baseline comparison. To evaluate COLAEVA,, a usability test was carried out with 9 test participants obtaining an average SUS score of 71.1. Moreover,, COLAEVA is available online to use and explore.

28768606#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Effective disease self-management lowers asthma's burden of disease for both individual patients and health care systems. In principle,, mobile health (mHealth) apps could enable effective asthma self-management interventions that improve a patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing the overall treatment costs for health care systems. However,, prior reviews in this field have found that mHealth apps for asthma lack clinical evaluation and are often not based on medical guidelines. Yet,, beyond the missing evidence for clinical efficacy,, little is known about the potential apps might have for improving asthma self-management.
28768606#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to assess the potential of publicly available and well-adopted mHealth apps for improving asthma self-management.
28768606#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Apple App store and Google Play store were systematically searched for asthma apps. In total,, 523 apps were identified,, of which 38 apps matched the selection criteria to be included in the review. Four requirements of app potential were investigated: app functions,, potential to change behavior (by means of a behavior change technique taxonomy),, potential to promote app use (by means of a gamification components taxonomy),, and app quality (by means of the Mobile Application Rating Scale [MARS]).
28768606#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=.80,, P<.001 between number of behavior change techniques and gamification components),, which suggests that an app's potential tends to be consistent across review frameworks.
28768606#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Several apps were identified that performed consistently well across all applied review frameworks,, thus indicating the potential mHealth apps offer for improving asthma self-management. However,, many apps suffer from low quality. Therefore,, app reviews should be considered as a decision support tool before deciding which app to integrate into a patient's asthma self-management. Furthermore,, several research-practice gaps were identified that app developers should consider addressing in future asthma apps.

34857221#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND & AIMS# rates (Mora et al.,, 2020). Now we present the validation of Breezing Med against Medical Graphics (MGC) CPX Ultima™,, a FDA 510 k cleared metabolic cart,, which principle is based on breath-by-breath analysis. In addition,, we present Breezing Med as a tool for daily measurement of metabolic rate by the lay person at home.
34857221#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A) The validation study was executed via parallel measurement of 20 healthy participants under resting conditions using both the Breezing Med and the MGC Ultima CPX™ (10 min test). B) Breezing Med measurements were carried out by six subjects at home during stay-at-home order due to COVID-19 for 30 days.
34857221#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A) The resulting measurements from both devices was compared with correlation slope's and R-squared coefficients close to 1. B) Results were recorded and analyzed for variability. The pilot study demonstrated the advantage of Breezing Med device to be easy-to-use at home by lay people,, which make the valuable device for telemedicine applications related to weight management from home.
34857221#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This result shows that the MGC Ultima CPX™ and Breezing Med are substantially equivalent for REE measurement; and an advantage of this device for metabolic assessment under the current COVID-19 pandemic situation,, for people with impaired physical mobility,, and for those who lives in rural areas or face impediments that limit physical access to care.

32379055#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the increasing use of remote measurement technologies (RMT) such as wearables or biosensors in health care programs,, challenges associated with selecting and implementing these technologies persist. Many health care programs that use RMT rely on commercially available,, "off-the-shelf" devices to collect patient data. However,, validation of these devices is sparse,, the technology landscape is constantly changing,, relative benefits between device options are often unclear,, and research on patient and health care provider preferences is often lacking.
32379055#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To address these common challenges,, we propose a novel device selection framework extrapolated from human-centered design principles,, which are commonly used in de novo digital health product design. We then present a case study in which we used the framework to identify,, test,, select,, and implement off-the-shelf devices for the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) consortium,, a research program using RMT to study central nervous system disease progression.
32379055#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The RADAR-CNS device selection framework describes a human-centered approach to device selection for mobile health programs. The framework guides study designers through stakeholder engagement,, technology landscaping,, rapid proof of concept testing,, and creative problem solving to develop device selection criteria and a robust implementation strategy. It also describes a method for considering compromises when tensions between stakeholder needs occur.
32379055#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The framework successfully guided device selection for the RADAR-CNS study on relapse in multiple sclerosis. In the initial stage,, we engaged a multidisciplinary team of patients,, health care professionals,, researchers,, and technologists to identify our primary device-related goals. We desired regular home-based measurements of gait,, balance,, fatigue,, heart rate,, and sleep over the course of the study. However,, devices and measurement methods had to be user friendly,, secure,, and able to produce high quality data. In the second stage,, we iteratively refined our strategy and selected devices based on technological and regulatory constraints,, user feedback,, and research goals. At several points,, we used this method to devise compromises that addressed conflicting stakeholder needs. We then implemented a feedback mechanism into the study to gather lessons about devices to improve future versions of the RADAR-CNS program.
32379055#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The RADAR device selection framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to device selection for health care programs and can be used to systematically approach complex decisions that require teams to consider patient experiences alongside scientific priorities and logistical,, technical,, or regulatory constraints.

33096907#ABSTRACT##Relevant to mobile health,, the design of a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) device using AD823X microchips as the analog front-end is presented. Starting with the evaluation board of the chip,, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable,, via Bluetooth to a PC,, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage,, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately,, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance,, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission,, whereas in microSD recording mode,, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost,, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized.

19263702#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for systolic BP (SBP),, diastolic BP (DBP),, saturation pulse,, manual pulse and temperature was 0.927,, 0.904,, 0.989,, 0.99 and 0.912 indicating a high degree of agreement between the two methods. For oxygen saturation,, the ICC was 0.763 indicating a moderately high agreement. For heart sounds,, the kappa coefficient (kappa) for inter-rater reliability was 0.48 (observed agreement of 96.1%). For breath sounds,, the 'kappa' value was 0.48 indicating moderate agreement. For the breath sounds,, the 'kappa' value was 0.38,, indicating fair agreement (the observed agreement of 94.2%). For the ECG,, the observed agreement was 94.4% by visual assessment.
19941546#ABSTRACT#AIM#This paper is a report of a study conducted to develop a theoretical model of the process nurses use to deliver care over the telephone.
19941546#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telephone nursing is practised internationally in diverse settings,, and research has shown it to be an effective service. Although studies have identified important variables that influence the practice,, the telephone nursing process in its entirety has not been described.
19941546#ABSTRACT#METHOD#In this grounded theory study,, data were collected from ten experienced telephone nurses from four different sites using semi-structured interviews. Concurrent data collection and analysis took place in 2005. A cumulative process of theoretical sampling and constant comparison was used to identify initial concepts,, and then expand,, validate,, and clarify them until the concepts and relationships were fully developed. The findings were validated through peer and participant review.
19941546#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#Telephone nursing is a dynamic and goal-oriented process consisting of three phases: gathering information,, cognitive processing,, and output. While generally sequential,, the phases can be simultaneous or recurring in response to caller needs. Interpreting takes place throughout the call; that is,, the nurse translates data from the caller into healthcare information and healthcare information into caller language. Factors shaping the process are call prioritization and level of complexity,, resource availability,, and the nurse's need for validation.
19941546#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Telephone nursing training and practice should emphasize gathering information,, using implicit and explicit information to identify client needs,, and translating healthcare information back into language comprehensible to clients.

35957207#ABSTRACT##Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era,, as the interpretation of the smart city at each person's level,, present several challenges associated with interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The Continua Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application communication to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper,, we describe the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level (SpO2) measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition,, respectively,, and a smartphone IEEE manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over the Bluetooth Health Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they are part of a telemonitoring system. This system was evaluated in a sample composed of 10 volunteers (mean age 29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG signal sitting and at rest,, before and after exercising for 15 min. Physiological measurements were assessed and compared against commercial devices,, and our expert physician did not find any relevant differences in the ECG signal. Additionally,, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing different heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate was under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia,, respectively.

31238956#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A perception survey was constructed with 23 questions,, distributed into 5 key areas (items) of user satisfaction. Its face validity was performed by five neurology specialists from the Teleneurology unit of HHT. The survey was applied to 167 patients of the HHT,, recruited between 2018 and 2019,, for conducting a pilot cross-sectional descriptive study to assess internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) and reliability (factorial analysis of main components). The survey showed an internal consistency of 0.88. Removing any of the items maintained its reliability in values over 0.8. All items showed point biserial correlations greater than 0.30. Overall,, the survey constructed and evaluated in this study showed high internal consistency and reliability values,, which will allow its application in further studies of quality assessment of the Teleneurology unit of HHT.

24958778#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Up to 30% of acute stroke evaluations are deemed stroke mimics (SM). As telestroke consultation expands across the world,, increasing numbers of SM patients are likely being evaluated via Telestroke. We developed a model to prospectively identify ischemic SMs during Telestroke evaluation.
34723819#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we aim to predict environment-associated risk from continuously acquired images of smokers' daily environments. We also aim to understand how model performance varies by location type,, as reported by participants.
16941809#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A net supported program (TaoNet) was installed at the AC to collect and analyse patient clinical data,, connected with the peripheral health units,, where clinical data and prothrombin time (expressed as international normalised ratio),, reported on portable monitors (Coagucheck),, are obtained and sent in real time to the AC. After clinical validation,, in a few minutes the AC sends the appropriate dose adjustment as well as clinical advice to the peripheral health units.
30588767#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Challenges when implementing telecytology for ROSE included technical issues,, workflow concerns,, and incorporating trainees into daily practice. The end result of our implementation was the adoption of an innovative way to deliver a ROSE service that maximised efficiency for cytopathologists without compromising diagnostic performance.

24958778#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#We analyzed 829 consecutive patients from January 2004 to April 2013 in our internal New England-based Partners TeleStroke Network for a derivation cohort,, and 332 cases for internal validation. External validation was performed on 226 cases from January 2008 to August 2012 in the Partners National TeleStroke Network. A predictive score was developed using stepwise logistic regression,, and its performance was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. There were 23% SM in the derivation,, 24% in the internal,, and 22% in external validation cohorts based on final clinical diagnosis. Compared to those with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (iCVD),, SM had lower mean age,, fewer vascular risk factors,, more frequent prior seizure,, and a different profile of presenting symptoms. The TeleStroke Mimic Score (TM-Score) was based on factors independently associated with SM status including age,, medical history (atrial fibrillation,, hypertension,, seizures),, facial weakness,, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >14. The TM-Score performed well on ROC curve analysis (derivation cohort AUC=0.75,, internal validation AUC=0.71,, external validation AUC=0.77).
24958778#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#SMs differ substantially from their iCVD counterparts in their vascular risk profiles and other characteristics. Decision-support tools based on predictive models,, such as our TM Score,, may help clinicians consider alternate diagnosis and potentially detect SMs during complex,, time-critical telestroke evaluations.

34723819#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Smokers from Durham,, North Carolina and surrounding areas completed ecological momentary assessments both immediately after smoking and at randomly selected times throughout the day for 2 weeks. At each assessment,, participants took a picture of their current environment and completed a questionnaire on smoking,, craving,, and the environmental setting. A convolutional neural network-based model was trained to predict smoking,, craving,, whether smoking was permitted in the current environment and whether the participant was outside based on images of participants' daily environments,, the time since their last cigarette,, and baseline data on daily smoking habits. Prediction performance,, quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and average precision (AP),, was assessed for out-of-sample prediction as well as personalized models trained on images from days 1 to 10. The models were optimized for mobile devices and implemented as a smartphone app.
34723819#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 48 participants completed the study,, and 8008 images were acquired. The personalized models were highly effective in predicting smoking risk (AUC=0.827; AP=0.882),, craving (AUC=0.837; AP=0.798),, whether smoking was permitted in the current environment (AUC=0.932; AP=0.981),, and whether the participant was outside (AUC=0.977; AP=0.956). The out-of-sample models were also effective in predicting smoking risk (AUC=0.723; AP=0.785),, whether smoking was permitted in the current environment (AUC=0.815; AP=0.937),, and whether the participant was outside (AUC=0.949; AP=0.922); however,, they were not effective in predicting craving (AUC=0.522; AP=0.427). Omitting image features reduced AUC by over 0.1 when predicting all outcomes except craving. Prediction of smoking was more effective for participants whose self-reported location type was more variable (Spearman ?=0.48; P=.001).
34723819#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Images of daily environments can be used to effectively predict smoking risk. Model personalization,, achieved by incorporating information about daily smoking habits and training on participant-specific images,, further improves prediction performance. Environment-associated smoking risk can be assessed in real time on a mobile device and can be incorporated into device-based smoking cessation interventions.

16941809#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Over the last decade,, the indications for oral anticoagulant therapy have been expanded considerably,, resulting in a significant increase in the number of patients followed at an anticoagulation clinic (AC). Some organisational problems,, in particular related to the healthcare staff and patients,, have led to the need for decentralising the healthcare activity using a telemedicine system. The aim of our project was (1) to reduce by 30% over a period of 3 years the number of patients who attend daily the AC,, (2) to maintain the same quality levels defined as time spent in the therapeutic range and number of complications; and (3) to assess patient satisfaction through an open questionnaire.

An increase in the time spent in the therapeutic range was observed compared with the previous 6 months (AC = 62%,, peripheral health units = 70%; p < 0.05). No differences in major complications were observed. Patients expressed their overall satisfaction,, as evaluated through an open questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS. This new organisation provides the following advantages: (1) direct communication between the peripheral health units and the AC; (2) an improvement in the time spent in the therapeutic range; (3) an improvement in patient satisfaction and quality of life; (4) continuing patient record update; and (5) time gained by the healthcare staff.

30588767#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A dynamic telemicroscopy solution was selected that required trained cytotechnologists to attend on-site procedures for ROSE. For validation 60 cases were reviewed using the first camera at each facility,, but only 20 cases to validate subsequent cameras. A concordance rate of >90% between ROSE interpretation performed digitally to original interpretations was required for clinical validation. After reviewing 440 cases from two comparable time periods before and after implementation,, employing telecytology was shown to decrease cytopathologists' work time per ROSE case from an average of 20.95?min per case to 2.91?min per case (86% time savings). The non-diagnostic rate for traditional ROSE was 7.7% compared with 4.1% after the implementation of telecytology,, and the deferral rate went from 43.6% for traditional ROSE to 44.1% with telecytology. Traditional ROSE diagnoses correlated with final diagnoses in 91.8% cases,, compared to 95.5% with telecytology.
31855184#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Star defined infrastructure as something other things "run on"; it consists mainly of "boring things." Building on her classic 1999 paper,, and acknowledging contemporary developments in technologies,, services,, and systems,, we developed a new theorization of health information infrastructure with five defining characteristics: (1) a material scaffolding,, backgrounded when working and foregrounded upon breakdown; (2) embedded,, relational,, and emergent; (3) collectively learned,, known,, and practiced (through technologically-supported cooperative work and organizational routines); (4) patchworked (incrementally built and fixed) and path-dependent (influenced by technical and socio-cultural legacies); and (5) institutionally supported and sustained (eg,, embodying standards negotiated and overseen by regulatory and professional bodies).
31855184#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our theoretical objective was,, in a health care context,, to explore what information infrastructure is and how it shapes,, supports,, and constrains technological innovation. Our empirical objective was to examine the challenges of implementing and scaling up video consultation services.
31855184#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this naturalistic case study,, we collected a total of 450 hours of ethnographic observations,, over 100 interviews,, and about 100 local and national documents over 54 months. Sensitized by the characteristics of infrastructure,, we sought examples of infrastructural challenges that had slowed implementation and scale-up. We arranged data thematically to gain familiarity before undertaking an analysis informed by strong structuration,, neo-institutional,, and social practice theories,, together with elements taken from the actor-network theory.
37353827#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Utilization of under 5-year-old child healthcare services in Egypt is considered low,, the highest proportion of well-baby visits is mainly for immunization in the first 2 years of age. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to be a useful and low-cost way to disseminate information about proper nutrition,, can be used to monitor children's growth using the official charts of World Health Organization,, can also help in accessing vaccine-related information and schedules.

31855184#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We documented scale-up challenges at three different sites in our original case study,, all of which relate to "boring things": the selection of a platform to support video-mediated consultations,, the replacement of desktop computers with virtual desktop infrastructure profiles,, and problems with call quality. In a fourth subcase,, configuration issues with licensed video-conferencing software limited the spread of the innovation to another UK site. In all four subcases,, several features of infrastructure were evident,, including: (1) intricacy and lack of dependability of the installed base; (2) interdependencies of technologies,, processes,, and routines,, such that a fix for one problem generated problems elsewhere in the system; (3) the inertia of established routines; (4) the constraining (and,, occasionally,, enabling) effect of legacy systems; and (5) delays and conflicts relating to clinical quality and safety standards.
31855184#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Innovators and change agents who wish to introduce new technologies in health services and systems should: (1) attend to materiality (eg,, expect bugs and breakdowns,, and prioritize basic dependability over advanced functionality); (2) take a systemic and relational view of technologies (versus as an isolated tool or function); (3) remember that technology-supported work is cooperative and embedded in organizational routines,, which are further embedded in other routines; (4) innovate incrementally,, taking account of technological and socio-cultural legacies; (5) consider standards but also where these standards come from and what priorities and interests they represent; and (6) seek to create leeway for these standards to be adapted to different local conditions.

15337991#ABSTRACT##The increasing bureaucracy of health care has had a serious negative impact on physicians and patients for the last fifteen years. We report an example of this trend involving the interstate interpretation of dermatopathology specimens,, which resulted in a significant interruption of diagnostic services to a large number of dermatologists. Temporary and long term solutions are discussed with the hope that dialogue and political consensus-building can bring resolution to the problem.

26130735#ABSTRACT##The evolving telecommunications industry combined with medical information technology has been proposed as a solution to reduce health care cost and provide remote medical services. This paper aims to validate and show the feasibility and user acceptance of using a telerehabilitation system called Kinect Rehabilitation System (KiReS) in a real scenario,, with patients attending repeated rehabilitation sessions after they had a Total Hip Replacement (THR). We present the main features of KiReS,, how it was set up in the considered scenario and the experimental results obtained in relation to two different perspectives: patients' subjective perceptions (gathered through questionnaires) and the accuracy of the performed exercises (by analysing the data captured using KiReS). We made a full deployment of KiReS,, defining step by step all the elements of a therapy: postures,, movements,, exercises and the therapy itself. Seven patients participated in this trial in a total of 19 sessions,, and the system recorded 3865 exercise executions. The group showed general support for telerehabilitation and the possibilities that systems such as KiReS bring to physiotherapy treatment.

11187501#ABSTRACT##This study investigates the applicability of a novel codification scheme based on two healthcare informatics standards (namely the VITAL (ENV 13734) and DICOM Sup. 30 Waveform Interchange) in addressing the robust interchange of waveform and medical data in remote healthcare applications. To further address system validation and clinical acceptance issues,, pilots were set-up between home-monitoring stations and a hospital-based telemedicine consultation center. The pilots focused in assessing applicability,, technical feasibility and performance of the proposed codification scheme based on the two standards. This paper presents the system and services requirements as studied for a home-care application,, the design goals for the preservation of security stature,, the practical issues of validation and the results of integrating these codification schemes into a commercial patient connected device.

37353827#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To assess needs and requirements for a new comprehensive well-baby clinic mobile application (app) covering well-baby clinic service components. Thereafter,, to develop the app prototype and validate it.
37353827#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study was conducted in four phases: User requirements,, development,, validation and usage. In user requirement phase,, the need for the new app was assessed by performing literature review,, market app research and an online survey. In development phase,, we developed the novel well-baby clinic app that constituted all well-baby clinic services for children's health monitoring relying on evidence-based information and honoring data safety. In validation phase,, after a series of testing,, the app was validated using Mobile app rating scale (MARS) by public health and pediatrics consultants to assess its quality. Finally,, the app was launched and made available to the public on Android platform.
37353827#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Sehhat Tefly app was developed based on the demands and requirements of mothers of under 5-year-old children. The app constituted caregiver,, child information and seven service elements: physical growth,, developmental milestones,, immunizations,, nutrition,, teething,, safety & emergency measures and report. The app quality mean was rated 3.7 out of 5 by the panel of experts. The app was downloaded 1445 times in a 4 month period.
37353827#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Sehhat Tefly app can meet the need for a free,, easy and accessible tool for caregivers to track the progress of children's development and wellbeing. It can also provide advice for referral to physician consultation in case of deviation from normal measures.

30823373#ABSTRACT##Rehabilitation following knee injury or surgery is critical for recovery of function and independence. However,, patient non-adherence remains a significant barrier to success. Remote rehabilitation using mobile health (mHealth) technologies have potential for improving adherence to and execution of home exercise. We developed a remote rehabilitation management system combining two wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) with an interactive mobile application and a web-based clinician portal (interACTION). However,, in order to translate interACTION into the clinical setting,, it was first necessary to verify the efficacy of measuring knee motion during rehabilitation exercises for physical therapy and determine if visual feedback significantly improves the participant's ability to perform the exercises correctly. Therefore,, the aim of this study was to verify the accuracy of the IMU-based knee angle measurement system during three common physical therapy exercises,, quantify the effect of visual feedback on exercise performance,, and understand the qualitative experience of the user interface through survey data. A convenience sample of ten healthy control participants were recruited for an IRB-approved protocol. Using the interACTION application in a controlled laboratory environment,, participants performed ten repetitions of three knee rehabilitation exercises: heel slides,, short arc quadriceps contractions,, and sit-to-stand. The heel slide exercise was completed without feedback from the mobile application,, then all exercises were performed with visual feedback. Exercises were recorded simultaneously by the IMU motion tracking sensors and a video-based motion tracking system. Validation showed moderate to good agreement between the two systems for all exercises and accuracy was within three degrees. Based on custom usability survey results,, interACTION was well received. Overall,, this study demonstrated the potential of interACTION to measure range of motion during rehabilitation exercises for physical therapy and visual feedback significantly improved the participant's ability to perform the exercises correctly.

29668479#ABSTRACT##Smartphones are ubiquitous,, but it is still unknown what physiological functions can be monitored at clinical quality. In medicine their use is cited in many fields (cardiology,, pulmology,, endocrinology,, rheumatology,, pediatrics as well as in the field of mental health). The aim of this paper is to explain how the use of mobile application can help clients to improve the index of their focus,, concentration and motor skills. Our original developed application on Android operating system,, named "neurogame" is based on an open source platform to enable assessment and therapeutic stimulation,, focus and concentration with the ability to monitor the progress of the results obtained in a larger number of participants (normal subjects as well as patients with different disorders) over a period of time. Whilst nowadays the predominant focus is on the pharmacological treatments,, there is a rapidly growing interest in research on alternative options that will offer help in many cases of disorder management in terms of mobile application games. In order to have some kind of "norms",, we evaluated a group of healthy population. Obtained results will serve as a database for comparison the future results. This article displays the results obtained as database.

32130162#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of mobile apps for health is growing. This rapid growth in the number of health apps can make it hard to assess their quality and features. The increased demand for and availability of mobile health apps highlights the importance of regular publication of reviews to identify potential areas of unmet needs and concern. The focus of this review is mobile apps for monitoring growth for health care professionals,, caregivers,, and patients. Monitoring growth as a part of healthy physical development is important across different periods of childhood and adolescence.
32130162#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this content analysis is to map and understand the types of apps that currently exist that are related to growth monitoring and growth hormone treatment.
32130162#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A semiautomated search was undertaken using the app search engine 42Matters,, complemented by a manual search for growth apps using the web search tool of Google Play (Android App Store). Apps were rated on their relevance to growth monitoring and categorized by independent raters.

32130162#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 76 apps were rated relevant to growth monitoring or growth hormone treatment. The level of agreement was measured for the semiautomated search and was very high (?=0.97). The target audience for 87% of the apps (66/76) was patients and relatives,, followed by health care professionals (11%; 8/76) and both (3%; 2/76). Apps in the category "growth tracking tools for children and babies" were retrieved most often (46%; 35/76) followed by "general baby care apps" (32%; 24/76),, "nonpharmacological solutions for growth" (12%; 9/76) and "growth hormone-related" (11%; 8/76). Overall,, 19/76 apps (25%) tracked a precise location.
32130162#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study mapped the type of apps currently available for growth monitoring or growth hormone treatment that can be used as a foundation for more detailed evaluations of app quality. The popularity of care apps for children and growth monitoring apps should provide a great channel for potential intervention in childhood health in the future.

Therefore,, consideration of patients' perceived electronic health (eHealth) literacy skills is crucial for improving the delivery of patient-centered health information.
32720900#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to translate and adapt the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) to conditions in Norway,, and to determine its psychometric properties. More specifically,, we set out to determine the reliability (internal consistency,, test-retest) and construct validity (structural validity,, hypotheses testing,, and cross-cultural validity) of the eHEALS in self-report format administered to patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.
32720900#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original English version of the eHEALS was translated into Norwegian following a widely used cross-cultural adaptation process. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach a. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed for a priori-specified 1-,, 2-,, and 3-factor models. Demographic,, health-related internet use,, health literacy,, and health status information was collected to examine correlations with eHEALS scores.

32720900#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 1695 patients after percutaneous coronary intervention were included in the validation analysis. The mean age was 66 years,, and the majority of patients were men (1313,, 77.46%). Cronbach a for the eHEALS was >.99. The corresponding Cronbach a for the 2-week retest was .94. The test-retest ICC for eHEALS was 0.605 (95% CI 0.419-0.743,, P<.001). The CFA showed a modest model fit for the 1- and 2-factor models (root mean square error of approximation>0.06). After modifications in the 3-factor model,, all of the goodness-of-fit indices indicated a good fit. There was a weak correlation with age (r=-0.206). Between-groups analysis of variance showed a difference according to educational groups and the eHEALS score,, with a mean difference ranging from 2.24 (P=.002) to 4.61 (P<.001),, and a higher eHEALS score was found for patients who were employed compared to those who were retired (mean difference 2.31,, P<.001). The eHEALS score was also higher among patients who reported using the internet to find health information (95% CI -21.40 to -17.21,, P<.001),, and there was a moderate correlation with the patients' perceived usefulness (r=0.587) and importance (r=0.574) of using the internet for health information. There were also moderate correlations identified between the eHEALS score and the health literacy domains appraisal of health information (r=0.380) and ability to find good health information (r=0.561). Weak correlations with the mental health composite score (r=0.116) and physical health composite score (r=0.116) were identified.
32720900#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study provides new information on the psychometric properties of the eHEALS for patients after percutaneous coronary intervention,, suggesting a multidimensional rather than unidimensional construct. However,, the study also indicated a redundancy of items,, indicating the need for further validation studies.

29106872#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study used a modified Delphi expert consensus method. Participants were an international sample of 27 clinicians/researchers. Participants rated level of agreement with recommendations across seven perioperative domains,, derived systematically from scientific and lay literature. A priori consensus analysis was conducted using threshold criterion. A multidisciplinary team of local clinicians were also individually interviewed to consolidate text messages and implement recurrent suggestions.
29106872#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the modified Delphi panel,, 30 statements reached threshold agreement (>3.0 of 4.0); recommendations surrounding diet (3.87) and hygiene (3.83) had the highest level of consensus,, while recommendations regarding activity (3.42) and non-pharmacologic pain management (3.55) had the lowest consensus. The 30 statements reconfigured into 12 concise text messages. After further interviews with local clinicians,, 14 final text messages were included in the SMS protocol to be sent two weeks preoperatively to one week postoperatively.
29106872#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study illustrates the development of TTTM which is designed to deliver key sequential text messages at the optimal time during the perioperative setting to parents caring for their children who are undergoing tonsillectomy.

27102160#ABSTRACT##The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a low-cost,, markerless motion capture device that tracks hand,, wrist and forearm position. Integration of this technology into healthcare applications has begun to occur rapidly,, making validation of the LMC?s data output an important research goal. Here,, we perform a detailed evaluation of the kinematic data output from the LMC,, and validate this output against gold-standard,, markered motion capture technology. We instructed subjects to perform three clinically-relevant wrist (flexion/extension,, radial/ulnar deviation) and forearm (pronation/supination) movements. The movements were simultaneously tracked using both the LMC and a marker-based motion capture system from Motion Analysis Corporation (MAC). Adjusting for known inconsistencies in the LMC sampling frequency,, we compared simultaneously acquired LMC and MAC data by performing Pearson?s correlation (r) and root mean square error (RMSE). Wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation showed good overall agreement (r=0.95; RMSE=11.6°,, and r=0.92; RMSE=12.4°,, respectively) with the MAC system. However,, when tracking forearm pronation/supination,, there were serious inconsistencies in reported joint angles (r=0.79; RMSE=38.4°). Hand posture significantly influenced the quality of wrist deviation (P<0.005) and forearm supination/pronation (P<0.001),, but not wrist flexion/extension (P=0.29). We conclude that the LMC is capable of providing data that are clinically meaningful for wrist flexion/extension,, and perhaps wrist deviation. It cannot yet return clinically meaningful data for measuring forearm pronation/supination. Future studies should continue to validate the LMC as updated versions of their software are developed.

30085018#ABSTRACT#AIMS#Early detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is essential for stroke prevention. Emerging technologies such as smartphone cameras using photoplethysmography (PPG) and mobile,, internet-enabled electrocardiography (iECG) are effective for AF screening. This study compared a PPG-based algorithm against a cardiologist's iECG diagnosis to distinguish between AF and sinus rhythm (SR).
30085018#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#In this prospective,, two-centre,, international,, clinical validation study,, we recruited in-house patients with presumed AF and matched controls in SR at two university hospitals in Switzerland and Germany. In each patient,, a PPG recording on the index fingertip using a regular smartphone camera followed by iECG was obtained. Photoplethysmography recordings were analysed using an automated algorithm and compared with the blinded cardiologist's iECG diagnosis. Of 672 patients recruited,, 80 were excluded mainly due to insufficient PPG/iECG quality,, leaving 592 patients (SR: n?=?344,, AF: n?=?248). Based on 5 min of PPG heart rhythm analysis,, the algorithm detected AF with a sensitivity of 91.5% (95% confidence interval 85.9-95.4) and specificity of 99.6% (97.8-100). By reducing analysis time to 1 min,, sensitivity was reduced to 89.9% (85.5-93.4) and specificity to 99.1% (97.5-99.8). Correctly classified rate was 88.8% for 1-min PPG analysis and dropped to 60.9% when the threshold for the analysed file was set to 5 min of good signal quality.
30085018#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This is the first prospective clinical two-centre study to demonstrate that detection of AF by using a smartphone camera alone is feasible,, with high specificity and sensitivity. Photoplethysmography signal analysis appears to be suitable for extended AF screening.

37183163#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Several smart devices are able to detect atrial fibrillation automatically by recording a single-lead electrocardiogram,, and have created a work overload at the hospital level as a result of the need for over-reads by physicians.
37183163#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We compared the rate of inconclusive tracings and the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of atrial fibrillation between the manufacturers' algorithms and the deep neural network-based algorithm on five smart devices,, using a physician-interpreted 12-lead electrocardiogram as the reference standard.
37183163#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 117 patients (27% female,, median age 65 years,, atrial fibrillation present at time of recording in 30%) included in the final analysis (resulting in 585 analyzed single-lead electrocardiogram tracings),, the deep neural network-based algorithm exhibited a higher conclusive rate relative to the manufacturer algorithm for all five models: 98% vs. 84% for Apple; 99% vs. 81% for Fitbit; 96% vs. 77% for AliveCor; 99% vs. 85% for Samsung; and 97% vs. 74% for Withings (P<0.01,, for each model). When applying our deep neural network-based algorithm,, sensitivity and specificity to correctly identify atrial fibrillation were not significantly different for all assessed smart devices.
37183163#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In this clinical validation,, the deep neural network-based algorithm significantly reduced the number of tracings labeled inconclusive,, while demonstrating similarly high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of atrial fibrillation,, thereby providing a possible solution to the data surge created by these smart devices.
30037001#ABSTRACT##Ubiquitous eHealth systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers in the effort to reduce the financial impact of an ageing society. At the heart of such systems sit activity recognition algorithms,, which need sensor data to reason over,, and a ground truth of adequate quality used for training and validation purposes. The large set up costs of such research projects and their complexity limit rapid developments in this area. Therefore,, information sharing and reuse,, especially in the context of collected datasets,, is key in overcoming these barriers. One approach which facilitates this process by reducing ambiguity is the use of ontologies. This article presents a hierarchical ontology for activities of daily living (ADL),, together with two use cases of ground truth acquisition in which this ontology has been successfully utilised. Requirements placed on the ontology by ongoing work are discussed.

35027527#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The daily use of mobile healthcare applications is already a reality around the world. Their supply and demand forecasts continue to increase exponentially due to the multiple facilities and improvements that they can offer to health management and patient-centered care,, especially for the chronically ill. However,, this exponential growth in the offer confuses when choosing the best mobile application to use due to the lack of scientific evidence on whether they meet the safety criteria for patients and professionals. The objective of this work was to analyze mobile applications to record and monitor the adverse effects of Available Oral Antineoplastic Treatments,, to have a guide on which of these applications could be recommended with certainty by health professionals to cancer patients.
35027527#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search of mobile applications was carried out on the Android and iOS platforms in Spanish and English. Subsequently,, each application is analyzed according to the accreditation criteria of the iSYSCore (Internet Health and Society) and the Tic Salut Social Foundation.
35027527#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Twelve applications were found for monitoring the adverse effects of ANEOs,, eight of which could be safely recommended by healthcare professionals where the scores of the Tic Salut Social Foundation range from 31 to 32 points out of 40 and those of iSYSCore from 31 to 36 points out of 47.
35027527#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The e-Onco Salud® application stands out for its ability to improve health management and empower patients in the management of their disease.

26847070#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To inform the development of a web-based application integrated with the primary care electronic health record,, we undertook a collaborative user-centered design process to develop a consumer-focused e-health tool for cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
26847070#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A four-phase iterative process involved ten multidisciplinary clinicians and academics (primary care physician,, nurses and allied health professionals),, two design consultants,, one graphic designer,, three software developers and fourteen proposed end-users. This 18-month process involved,, (1) defining the target audience and needs,, (2) pilot testing and refinement,, (3) software development including validation and testing the algorithm,, (4) user acceptance testing and beta testing. From this process,, researchers were able to better understand end-user needs and preferences,, thereby improving and enriching the increasingly detailed system designs and prototypes for a mobile responsive web application.
26847070#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We reviewed 14 relevant applications/websites and sixteen observational and interventional studies to derive a set of core components and ideal features for the system. These included the need for interactivity,, visual appeal,, credible health information,, virtual rewards,, and emotional and physical support. The features identified as essential were: (i) both mobile and web-enabled 'apps',, (ii) an emphasis on medication management,, (iii) a strong psychosocial support component. Subsequent workshops (n=6; 2×1.5h) informed the development of functionality and lo-fidelity sketches of application interfaces. These ideas were next tested in consumer focus groups (n=9; 3×1.5h). Specifications for the application were refined from this feedback and a graphic designer iteratively developed the interface. Concurrently,, the electronic health record was linked to the consumer portal. A written description of the final algorithms for all decisions and outputs was provided to software programmers. These algorithmic outputs to the app were first validated against those obtained from an independently programmed version in STATA 11. User acceptance testing (n=5,, 2×1.0h) and beta testing revealed technical bugs and interface concerns across commonly-used web browsers and smartphones. These were resolved and re-tested until functionality was optimized.

A user-centered design approach aided the integration of these needs into the concept,, specifications,, development and refinement of a responsive web application for risk factor reduction and disease prevention.

26736232#ABSTRACT##In this paper,, we present an interactive physical therapy system (IPTS) for remote quantitative assessment of clients in the home. The system consists of two different interactive interfaces connected through a network,, for a real-time low latency video conference using audio,, video,, skeletal,, and depth data streams from a Microsoft Kinect. To test the potential of IPTS,, experiments were conducted with 5 independent living senior subjects in Kansas City,, MO. Also,, experiments were conducted in the lab to validate the real-time biomechanical measures calculated using the skeletal data from the Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect and Microsoft Xbox One Kinect,, with ground truth data from a Vicon motion capture system. Good agreements were found in the validation tests. The results show potential capabilities of the IPTS system to provide remote physical therapy to clients,, especially older adults,, who may find it difficult to visit the clinic.

17869159#ABSTRACT##The wearable physiological monitoring system is a washable shirt,, which uses an array of sensors connected to a central processing unit with firmware for continuously monitoring physiological signals. The data collected can be correlated to produce an overall picture of the wearer's health. In this paper,, we discuss the wearable physiological monitoring system called 'Smart Vest'. The Smart Vest consists of a comfortable to wear vest with sensors integrated for monitoring physiological parameters,, wearable data acquisition and processing hardware and remote monitoring station. The wearable data acquisition system is designed using microcontroller and interfaced with wireless communication and global positioning system (GPS) modules. The physiological signals monitored are electrocardiogram (ECG),, photoplethysmogram (PPG),, body temperature,, blood pressure,, galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate. The acquired physiological signals are sampled at 250samples/s,, digitized at 12-bit resolution and transmitted wireless to a remote physiological monitoring station along with the geo-location of the wearer. The paper describes a prototype Smart Vest system used for remote monitoring of physiological parameters and the clinical validation of the data are also presented.

24604439#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Recent studies report improved survival associated with skilled triage and treatment in the out-of-hospital/preoperative phase of combat casualty care. Historically,, ground combat units are assigned primary care physicians and physician assistants as medical staff,, due to resource limitations. Although they are recognized as optimal resuscitators,, demand for military trauma surgeons and emergency physicians exceeds supply and is unlikely to improve in the near term.
24604439#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A prospective trial of telemedical mentoring during a casualty resuscitation encounter was studied using a high-fidelity patient simulator (HFPS). Subjects were randomized and formed into experimental (CTS) or control teams. CTS team leaders were equipped with a headset/microphone interface and telementored by a combat-experienced emergency physician or trauma surgeon. A standardized,, scripted clinical scenario and HFPS were used with 14 critical actions. At completion,, subjects were surveyed. Statistical approach included contingency table analysis,, two-tailed t-test,, and correlation coefficient. This study was reviewed and approved by our institutional review board (IRB).
24604439#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Eighteen CTS teams and 16 control teams were studied. By intention-to-treat ITT analysis,, 89% of CTS teams versus 56% of controls completed all life-threatening inventions (LSIs) (p<.01); 78% versus 19% completed all critical actions (p<.01); and 89% versus 56% established advanced airways within 8 minutes (p<.06). Average time to completion in minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 95) was 12 minutes (10?14) for CTS versus 18 (16?20) for controls,, with 75% of control teams not completing all critical actions.
24604439#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In this model,, real-time telementoring of simulated trauma resuscitation was feasible and improved accuracy and efficiency of non?emergency-trained resuscitators. Clinical validation and replicated study of these findings for guiding remote damage control resuscitation are warranted.

34757324#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to categorize program SMS text messages and participant replies using machine learning (ML) and to examine whether message characteristics are associated with premature program stopping and engagement.
34757324#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We assessed communication logs from SMS text message-based chronic disease prevention studies that encouraged 1-way (SupportMe/ITM) and 2-way (TEXTMEDS [Text Messages to Improve Medication Adherence and Secondary Prevention]) communication. Outgoing messages were manually categorized into 5 message intents (informative,, instructional,, motivational,, supportive,, and notification) and replies into 7 groups (stop,, thanks,, questions,, reporting healthy,, reporting struggle,, general comment,, and other). Grid search with 10-fold cross-validation was implemented to identify the best-performing ML models and evaluated using nested cross-validation. Regression models with interaction terms were used to compare the association of message intent with premature program stopping and engagement (replied at least 3 times and did not prematurely stop) in SupportMe/ITM and TEXTMEDS.
34757324#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We analyzed 1550 messages and 4071 participant replies. Approximately 5.49% (145/2642) of participants responded with stop,, and 11.7% (309/2642) of participants were engaged. Our optimal ML model correctly classified program message intent with 76.6% (95% CI 63.5%-89.8%) and replies with 77.8% (95% CI 74.1%-81.4%) balanced accuracy (average area under the curve was 0.95 and 0.96,, respectively). Overall,, supportive (odds ratio [OR] 0.53,, 95% CI 0.35-0.81) messages were associated with reduced chance of stopping,, as were informative messages in SupportMe/ITM (OR 0.35,, 95% CI 0.20-0.60) but not in TEXTMEDS (for interaction,, P<.001). Notification messages were associated with a higher chance of stopping in SupportMe/ITM (OR 5.76,, 95% CI 3.66-9.06) but not TEXTMEDS (for interaction,, P=.01). Overall,, informative (OR 1.76,, 95% CI 1.46-2.12) and instructional (OR 1.47,, 95% CI 1.21-1.80) messages were associated with higher engagement but not motivational messages (OR 1.18,, 95% CI 0.82-1.70; P=.37). For supportive messages,, the association with engagement was opposite with SupportMe/ITM (OR 1.77,, 95% CI 1.21-2.58) compared with TEXTMEDS (OR 0.77,, 95% CI 0.60-0.98; for interaction,, P<.001). Notification messages were associated with reduced engagement in SupportMe/ITM (OR 0.07,, 95% CI 0.05-0.10) and TEXTMEDS (OR 0.28,, 95% CI 0.20-0.39); however,, the strength of the association was greater in SupportMe/ITM (for interaction P<.001).
34757324#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#ML models enable monitoring and detailed characterization of program messages and participant replies. Outgoing message intent may influence premature program stopping and engagement,, although the strength and direction of association appear to vary by program type. Future studies will need to examine whether modifying message characteristics can optimize engagement and whether this leads to behavior change.

37347757#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Remote self-administered visual acuity (VA) tests have the potential to allow patients and non-specialists to assess vision without eye health professional input. Validation in pragmatic trials is necessary to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of tests in relevant settings to justify deployment. Here,, published pragmatic trials of these tests were synthesised to summarise the effectiveness of available options and appraise the quality of their supporting evidence.
37347757#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic review was undertaken in accordance with a preregistered protocol (CRD42022385045). The Cochrane Library,, Embase,, MEDLINE,, and Scopus were searched. Screening was conducted according to the following criteria: (1) English language; (2) primary research article; (3) visual acuity test conducted out of eye clinic; (4) no clinical administration of remote test; (5) accuracy or reliability of remote test analysed. There were no restrictions on trial participants. Quality assessment was conducted with QUADAS-2.
37347757#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of 1227 identified reports,, 10 studies were ultimately included. One study was at high risk of bias and two studies exhibited concerning features of bias; all studies were applicable. Three trials-of DigiVis,, iSight Professional,, and Peek Acuity-from two studies suggested that accuracy of the remote tests is comparable to clinical assessment. All other trials exhibited inferior accuracy,, including conflicting results from a pooled study of iSight Professional and Peek Acuity. Two studies evaluated test-retest agreement-one trial provided evidence that DigiVis is as reliable as clinical assessment. The three most accurate tests required access to digital devices. Reporting was inconsistent and often incomplete,, particularly with regards to describing methods and conducting statistical analysis.
37347757#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Remote self-administered VA tests appear promising,, but further pragmatic trials are indicated to justify deployment in carefully defined contexts to facilitate patient or non-specialist led assessment. Deployment could augment teleophthalmology,, non-specialist eye assessment,, pre-consultation triage,, and autonomous long-term monitoring of vision.

27126063#ABSTRACT##Web-delivered trials are an important component in eHealth services. These trials,, mostly behavior-based,, generate big heterogeneous data that are longitudinal,, high dimensional with missing values. Unsupervised learning methods have been widely applied in this area,, however,, validating the optimal number of clusters has been challenging. Built upon our multiple imputation (MI) based fuzzy clustering,, MIfuzzy,, we proposed a new multiple imputation based validation (MIV) framework and corresponding MIV algorithms for clustering big longitudinal eHealth data with missing values,, more generally for fuzzy-logic based clustering methods. Specifically,, we detect the optimal number of clusters by auto-searching and -synthesizing a suite of MI-based validation methods and indices,, including conventional (bootstrap or cross-validation based) and emerging (modularity-based) validation indices for general clustering methods as well as the specific one (Xie and Beni) for fuzzy clustering. The MIV performance was demonstrated on a big longitudinal dataset from a real web-delivered trial and using simulation. The results indicate MI-based Xie and Beni index for fuzzy-clustering are more appropriate for detecting the optimal number of clusters for such complex data. The MIV concept and algorithms could be easily adapted to different types of clustering that could process big incomplete longitudinal trial data in eHealth services.
26258931#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Hospitalization due to heart failure (HF) continues to be a major clinical and economic challenge. To reduce hospitalization,, this paper proposes a novel home telemonitoring system for an early warning of acute decompensation in patients with chronic stable New York Heart Association class II-IV HF.
26258931#ABSTRACT#METHODS#It is based on deriving nocturnal respiratory related time series using a noncontact radio-wave bio-motion sensor. The system generates an alert when there is a change in the underlying probability distribution of the time series which can be regarded as a surrogate marker of patient stability.
26258931#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The system's performance is evaluated using dual-site longitudinal data collected from 104 HF patients over 12-24 months. The system reported an average sensitivity of 0.62 to detect a change during an episode of acute decompensation and an average specificity of 0.67 on the blind validation set,, when the frequency of alert was four weeks. The system also performed well to predict acute decompensation with an average sensitivity of 0.55 and specificity of 0.73 on the validation set,, where an event window was defined as three weeks preceding an event.
26258931#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#These results demonstrate that the design and implementation of such a system is a positive step toward developing noncontact systems capable of preventing acute decompensation,, reducing readmissions to hospital and ensuring better quality of life for HF patients.

36046638#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Fatigue is a common symptom of many diseases,, including multiple sclerosis. It manifests as a cognitive or physical condition. Fatigue is poorly understood,, and effective therapies are missing. Furthermore,, there is a lack of methods to measure fatigue objectively. Fatigability,, the measurable decline in performance during a task,, has been suggested as a complementary method to quantify fatigue.
36046638#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop a new and objective measurement of cognitive fatigability and investigate its association with perceived fatigue.
36046638#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We introduced the cognitive fatigability assessment test (cFAST),, a novel smartphone-based test to quantify cognitive fatigability. Forty-two people with multiple sclerosis (23 fatigued and 19 non-fatigued,, defined by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions) took part in our validation study. Patients completed cFAST twice. We used t-tests,, Monte Carlo sampling,, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate our approach using two sets of proposed metrics.
36046638#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#When classifying fatigue,, our fatigability metric ?response time has a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.84),, making it the best performing metric for this task. Furthermore,, ?response time shows a statistically significant difference between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups (t?=?2.27,, P?=?.03). Particularly,, cognitively-fatigued patients decline in performance,, while non-fatigued patients do not.
36046638#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We introduce cFAST,, a new instrument to quantify cognitive fatigability. Our pilot study provides evidence that cognitive fatigability assessment test produces a quantifiable drop in cognitive performance in a short period. Furthermore,, our results indicate that cFAST may have the potential to serve as a surrogate for subjective cognitive fatigue. cFAST is significantly shorter than the existing fatigability assessments and does not require specialized equipment. Thus,, it could enable frequent and remote monitoring,, which could substantially aid clinicians in better understanding and treating fatigue.

34855156#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This report summarizes findings from a 2020 survey of US child and adolescent psychiatry training programs that explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric telepsychiatry training. The authors hypothesized that telepsychiatry training significantly increased during the pandemic,, in part due to legal and regulatory waivers during the COVID-19 public health emergency.
34855156#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In August 2020,, an anonymous,, 28-question online survey was emailed to all (138) accredited child psychiatry fellowships on the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website. Forty-nine programs responded (36%). This analysis focuses on three of the 28 questions relevant to the hypotheses: characteristics of the program's training in telepsychiatry; perceived impediments to clinical training; and perceived impediments to didactic training pre-COVID onset vs. post-COVID onset,, respectively. Total scores were created to investigate differences in training programs and impediments to including telepsychiatry pre- and post-COVID onset. Paired sample t-tests were used to compare means pre- and post-COVID onset.
34855156#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Results provided support for significant differences between training components related to telepsychiatry pre- and post-COVID onset,, with participants reporting more training components post-COVID onset (M?=?5.69) than pre-COVID onset (M?=?1.80); t(48)?=?9.33,, p?<?.001. Participants also reported significantly fewer barriers to providing clinical experiences in pediatric telepsychiatry post-COVID onset (M?=?2.65) than pre-COVID onset (M?=?4.90); t(48)?=??-?4.20,, p?<?.001.
34855156#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#During the COVID-19 pandemic,, pediatric telepsychiatry training in child psychiatry fellowships increased significantly. Perceived barriers to providing clinical,, but not didactic,, training decreased significantly.

10437282#ABSTRACT##The advent of new computer technologies appears as a revolution of surgical teaching,, as well as the planning and realisation of surgical procedures. The introduction of a camera into the body of a patient,, allowing the visual display of the operative procedure through the use of miniaturised camera constitutes the greatest alteration that the surgical world has experienced at the end of this century: mini-invasive surgery is born. This revolution was announces further changes: the development of telecommunication devices applied to medicine (tele-education,, teletraining,, telementoring,, teleproctoring and tele-accreditation) constitutes the basis of cybersurgery or virtual reality allowing the merging of the concepts of telepresence and telemanipulation. These new concepts were developed at the European Institute of TeleSurgery of Strasbourg. The TESUS project developed the use of surgical images and data transmission through the realisation of international multi-site video conferences between surgeons. The WEBS project created the first Virtual University concept placing surgical techniques at the surgeon's disposal through Internet. The HESSOS project uses virtual reality as a surgical simulation system. The MASTER project allows to develop the concept of distant telemanipulation. It is now possible to face surgical teaching outside of the restricted University frame and to conceive teaching on a world level,, offering to the practitioner unimaginable possibilities of formation,, training and planning of surgical procedures.
32340615#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#For a stress-management app to be persuasive and impactful,, designers and developers should obtain a clear perspective of the value proposition according to key stakeholders before development. However,, this is often not the case. In order to increase the chance of creating an impact by means of the Resilience Navigator app,, this study aims to identify key stakeholders and work with them to gain an in-depth understanding of the value proposition of this stress-management app.
32340615#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The approach used in this study builds on the approaches taken by Van Limburg et al. and Van Woezik et al. An initial list of stakeholders was identified by means of a literature scan. Stakeholders on this initial list took an online survey to identify key stakeholders with a ranking system. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of key stakeholders to identify the value proposition using the value proposition canvas as a framework for data collection. Finally,, the value proposition was validated by key stakeholders during focus groups.
32340615#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A thorough,, bottom-up identification and validation of the value proposition for the Resilience Navigator app was obtained,, reflecting key stakeholders' varying ideas on this piece of eHealth technology. The results will facilitate the continued development of the Resilience Navigator app from the value specification phase to the design phase. In the design phase,, the remaining assumptions regarding the app's value proposition should be tested using rapid prototyping.

32340615#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The key stakeholders identified included employees,, employers,, participation councils within organisations,, HR advisors,, product owners,, company doctors,, and business analysts. The interviews produced a list of approximately one hundred values from which fifteen core values were distilled. One example is to take into account time constraints experienced by users during stress periods. In general,, the Resilience Navigator app's main goal is to increase awareness of personal stress levels and causes of stress. In addition,, the sub-goal is to increase skills for effective stress management. The focus groups validated the idea that the most important values were reflected in the value proposition and had been appropriately translated into design elements,, according to key stakeholders.

29885390#ABSTRACT#AIMS#The increasing incidence and prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on a background of limited resources calls for innovative approaches healthcare provision. Our aim was to explore the effects of telemedicine supported GDM care on a range of health service utilisation and maternal and foetal outcomes.
29885390#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An exploratory randomised controlled trial of adjunct telemedicine support in the management of insulin-treated GDM compared to usual care control. Outcomes included health service use,, maternal and foetal clinical outcomes as well as costs. Groups were compared on outcomes and Poisson and Cox regression analysis were performed for predictors of health service utilisation,, glycaemic control and costs.
29885390#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#95 participants were recruited (intervention n?=?61,, control n?=?34). There were no differences between the groups in number of face-to-face appointments (median (IQR) intervention?=?8(7),, control?=?8(6),, p?=?0.843),, rates of caesareans,, macrosomia,, large for gestational age,, special care nursery admission or newborn birth-weight. The intervention had no impact on total (IRR?=?1.04,, p?=?0.596) or face-to-face (IRR?=?1.09,, p?=?0.257) clinic appointments or service provider costs. Participants receiving the intervention reached optimum glycaemic control quicker: mean (SD) 4.3(4.2) weeks vs. 7.6(4.5) weeks,, p?=?0.0001). Telemedicine was a significant predictor of better glycaemic control (HR?=?1.71(95%CI: 1.11,, 2.65,, p?=?0.015).
29885390#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Telemedicine support for GDM care showed no impact on service utilisation and costs. The intervention produced similar GDM clinical outcomes as usual care and posed no added risk to clinical quality of care. The intervention may be associated with fewer insulin dose titrations and participants achieved optimum glycaemic control sooner.

29286942#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES#Categorization of the casualties in accordance with medical care priorities is crucial in a military environment. Automation of the triage process is still a challenging task. The goal of the paper is to propose a novel algorithm for automation of medical emergency protocol in the military environment by the creation of classifiers that can provide accurate prioritization of injured soldier cases. It is a part of a complex military telemedicine system that provides continuous monitoring of soldiers' vital data gathered on-site using an unobtrusive set of sensors.
29286942#ABSTRACT#METHODS#After pre-processing the collected raw physiological data and eliminating the outliers using Naïve Bayesian Classifier,, the system is capable of calculating the risk level and categorizing the victims based on Markov Decision Process. The NBC has been trained with a dataset that has contained labels and 6 features. Training set has held 8000 randomly chosen samples. Twenty percent of the determined dataset has been used for the validation set.
29286942#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#For algorithm verification,, several evaluation scenarios have been created. In each scenario,, randomly generated vital sign data describing the hypothetical health condition of soldiers was contemporarily assessed by the system as well as by 50 experienced military medical physicians.
29286942#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The obtained correlation result of the proposed algorithm and medical physicians' classifications is strong evidence that the system can be implemented in warfare emergency medicine.

10346084#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine involves the use of rapidly evolving technology that carries enormous promise to improve the current level of medical care. In order to achieve these expectations,, some barriers beyond its technological development must be overcome. These are primarily legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved by the current stakeholders. These barriers arise from the fact that a newly developing telemedicine technology changes the way clinical care is delivered to the population and documented.

30892533#ABSTRACT##The implementation of electronic records in healthcare establishments has led to isolated solutions,, which contribute to the fragmentation of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). This research uses a strategic planning tool in order to monitor the trajectory of implementation of the records in medium and high complexity hospitals,, which are a benchmark for the health of women and children. The scope was to outline possible contributions for the computerization of health facilities in general. The methodology is based on the ethnography practices in hospitals. The study was qualitative,, descriptive with document analysis. The sources consulted were the minutes of the electronic records kept between 2012 and 2015. The synthetic narrative points to the lack of infrastructure,, resources and the conflict of interests involving several actors in the process. The electronic record legitimizes the institutional design and organizes the work,, besides mapping the hospital geography. The association of physical and digital records demands a change of institutional culture. Registration is an act of citizenship and becomes a key document in quality control and hospital accreditation.

32629044#ABSTRACT##Tele-rehabilitation can complement traditional rehabilitation therapies by providing valuable information that can help in the evaluation,, monitoring,, and treatment of patients. Many patient tele-monitoring systems that integrate wearable technology are emerging as an effective tool for the long-term surveillance of rehabilitation progression,, enabling continuous sampling of patient real-time movement in a non-invasive way,, without affecting the normal daily activity of the outpatient,, who,, therefore,, will not need to make frequent clinic visits. One of the main challenges of tele-rehabilitation systems is to pay special attention to the diversity of dysfunctions in patients by offering devices with customized behaviours adaptable to the physical conditions of each patient at the different stages of the rehabilitation therapy. Long-term monitoring systems need an adaptation policy to autonomously reconfigure their behaviour according to vital signs read during the physical activity of the patient,, the remaining battery level,, or the required accuracy of collected data. However,, it would alsobe desirable to adjust such adaptation policies over time,, according to the patient's evolution. This work presents a wearable patient-monitoring system for tele-rehabilitation that is able to dynamically self-configure its internal behaviour to the current context of the outpatient according to a set of adaptation policies that optimize battery consumption,, taking into account other QoS parameters at the same time. Our system is also able to self-adapt its internal adaptation policies as a patient's condition improves,, while maintaining the system's efficiency. We illustrate our proposal with a real mHealth case study. The results of the experiments show that the system updates the adaptation policies,, taking into account specific indicators of the disease. The validation results show that the evolution of the self-adaptation policies correlates with the progression of different patients.

28537495#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in crewmembers,, especially during long-term space missions.
28537495#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#To date,, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques.
28537495#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#One female volunteer,, with no previous medical experience,, performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a 25?mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the volunteer during microgravity,, the bed was tilted -6°.
28537495#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by radiologists,, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results.
28537495#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#This case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer in space missions.
28537495#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The results cannot be generalized based on one subject,, and additional research is warranted in this area in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique,, however,, has potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for long-term space missions at the ISS,, and eventually for human settlements on the Moon and Mars.

12244000#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Heart sounds from 47 patients with no murmur (n = 7),, with innocent murmurs (n = 20),, or with pathological murmurs (n = 20) were recorded using a sensor based stethoscope and e-mailed to a remote computer. The sounds were repeated,, giving 100 cases that were randomly distributed on a compact disc. Four cardiologists assessed and categorised the cases as having "no murmur",, "innocent murmur",, or "pathological murmur",, recorded the assessment time per case,, their degree of certainty,, and whether they recommended referral.
12244000#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#On average,, 2.1 minutes were spent on each case. The mean sensitivity and specificity were 89.7% and 98.2% respectively,, and the inter-observer and intra-observer variabilities were low (kappa 0.81 and 0.87),, respectively. A total of 93.4% of cases with a pathological murmur and 12.6% of cases with an innocent murmur were recommended for referral.
12244000#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Telemedical referral of patients with heart murmurs for remote assessment by a cardiologist is safe and saves time. Skilled auscultation is adequate to detect patients with innocent murmurs.

37023420#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As trachoma is eliminated,, skilled field graders become less adept at correctly identifying active disease (trachomatous inflammation-follicular [TF]). Deciding if trachoma has been eliminated from a district or if treatment strategies need to be continued or reinstated is of critical public health importance. Telemedicine solutions require both connectivity,, which can be poor in the resource-limited regions of the world in which trachoma occurs,, and accurate grading of the images.
37023420#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our purpose was to develop and validate a cloud-based "virtual reading center" (VRC) model using crowdsourcing for image interpretation.
37023420#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform was used to recruit lay graders to interpret 2299 gradable images from a prior field trial of a smartphone-based camera system. Each image received 7 grades for US $0.05 per grade in this VRC. The resultant data set was divided into training and test sets to internally validate the VRC. In the training set,, crowdsourcing scores were summed,, and the optimal raw score cutoff was chosen to optimize kappa agreement and the resulting prevalence of TF. The best method was then applied to the test set,, and the sensitivity,, specificity,, kappa,, and TF prevalence were calculated.

37023420#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In this trial,, over 16,,000 grades were rendered in just over 60 minutes for US $1098 including AMT fees. After choosing an AMT raw score cut point to optimize kappa near the World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed level of 0.7 (with a simulated 40% prevalence TF),, crowdsourcing was 95% sensitive and 87% specific for TF in the training set with a kappa of 0.797. All 196 crowdsourced-positive images received a skilled overread to mimic a tiered reading center and specificity improved to 99%,, while sensitivity remained above 78%. Kappa for the entire sample improved from 0.162 to 0.685 with overreads,, and the skilled grader burden was reduced by over 80%. This tiered VRC model was then applied to the test set and produced a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 76% with a kappa of 0.775 in the entire set. The prevalence estimated by the VRC was 2.70% (95% CI 1.84%-3.80%) compared to the ground truth prevalence of 2.87% (95% CI 1.98%-4.01%).
37023420#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A VRC model using crowdsourcing as a first pass with skilled grading of positive images was able to identify TF rapidly and accurately in a low prevalence setting. The findings from this study support further validation of a VRC and crowdsourcing for image grading and estimation of trachoma prevalence from field-acquired images,, although further prospective field testing is required to determine if diagnostic characteristics are acceptable in real-world surveys with a low prevalence of the disease.

33111249#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We find that telehealth was significantly associated with a 38% reduction in no-show rate compared with the prior year. Additionally,, providers had positive experiences with regard to the appropriateness and feasibility of using telehealth in the pre-operative bariatric surgery process.
33111249#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Telehealth use in the pre-operative bariatric surgery process may lead to greater efficiency in healthcare resource utilization. Insurance providers and bariatric accreditation bodies globally should consider accepting telehealth visits and self-reported weights when determining coverage decisions to ensure access for patients.

16808074#ABSTRACT##Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),, coupled with parallel progress in the field of computer-assisted surgery,, mean that an ideal environment has been created for the development of MRI-compatible robotic systems and manipulators,, capable of enhancing many types of surgical procedure. However,, MRI does impose severe restrictions on mechatronic devices to be used in or around the scanners. In this article a review of the developments in the field of MRI-compatible surgical manipulators over the last decade is presented. The manipulators developed make use of different methods of actuation,, but they can be reduced to four main groups: actuation transmitted through hydraulics,, pneumatic actuators,, ultrasonic motors based on the piezoceramic principle and remote manual actuation. Progress has been made concerning material selection,, position sensing,, and different actuation techniques,, and design strategies have been implemented to overcome the multiple restrictions imposed by the MRI environment. Most systems lack the clinical validation needed to continue on to commercial products.
34920549#ABSTRACT##The purpose of this research is to innovate and develop a vision-based remote monitoring alarm system for agitated patients to provide intensive care unit (ICU) nurses with action warnings for agitated patients during their busy work. After the system is completed,, preliminary laboratory verification is carried out,, and the results are 94.87% in sensitivity,, 97.44% in specificity,, and 96.15% in accuracy,, which enhances the confidence of the follow-up system in clinical testing.

11187495#ABSTRACT##The multimedia teleconsultation service ENDOTEL launches in May 2000 with its asynchronous component. In the initial phase,, three hospitals and four general practitioners use the service to consult a specialist in the domain of gastroenterology and endoscopy. By validation of the patient information,, i.e. videos,, voice clips,, still images and text,, the experts can decide the further proceeding,, for example,, whether a patient shall be transported to a specialized hospital or not (cost-saving). We report about the experiences during the initiation and the first months of operation.

28421356#ABSTRACT##Although mobile health (mHealth) technologies have shown promise in improving clinical care in resource-limited settings (RLS),, they are infrequently brought to scale. One limitation to the success of many mHealth interventions is inattention to end-user acceptability,, which is an important predictor of technology adoption. We conducted in-depth interviews with 43 people living with HIV in rural Uganda who had participated in a clinical trial of a short messaging system (SMS)-based intervention designed to prompt return to clinic after an abnormal laboratory test. Interviews focused on established features of technology acceptance models,, including perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness,, and included open-ended questions to gain insight into unexplored issues related to the intervention's acceptability. We used conventional (inductive) and direct content analysis to derive categories describing use behaviors and acceptability. Interviews guided development of a proposed conceptual framework,, the technology acceptance model for resource-limited settings (TAM-RLS). This framework incorporates both classic technology acceptance model categories as well as novel factors affecting use in this setting. Participants described how SMS message language,, phone characteristics,, and experience with similar technologies contributed to the system's ease of use. Perceived usefulness was shaped by the perception that the system led to augmented HIV care services and improved access to social support from family and colleagues. Emergent themes specifically related to mHealth acceptance among PLWH in Uganda included (1) the importance of confidentiality,, disclosure,, and stigma,, and (2) the barriers and facilitators downstream from the intervention that impacted achievement of the system's target outcome. The TAM-RLS is a proposed model of mHealth technology acceptance based upon end-user experiences in rural Uganda. Although the proposed model requires validation,, the TAM-RLS may serve as a useful tool to guide design and implementation of mHealth interventions.

9168698#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#New standards for hospital accreditation and health care reimbursement may require that faculty subspecialists be more available after regular working hours to supervise residents in academic radiology departments. We designed a receiver operating characteristic study to determine whether a thoracic radiologist who evaluated computed radiography (CR) images of the chest at a home-based teleradiology workstation could add significant value to a junior resident's interpretations of films within the hospital for acutely ill patients.
9168698#ABSTRACT#SUBJECTS AND METHODS#Using a hybrid cassette,, we obtained analog chest films and CR images simultaneously for each of 252 acutely ill patients in the emergency department and in an intensive care unit. Interpretations of the analog films by three first-year residents were analyzed for 11 parameters deemed critical for patient management. Likewise,, CR images of the same chest studies were viewed on a home teleradiology workstation by a faculty thoracic radiologist who analyzed the images for these 11 interpretive parameters. All interpretations by radiology residents and by the home-based thoracic radiologist were then compared with the interpretations of a consensus panel consisting of another thoracic radiologist and a full-time emergency department radiologist.
9168698#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Analysis of the pooled results from the three junior residents as a group failed to show significant differences between their interpretations of chest films and the interpretations of CR images by a thoracic radiologist at a home workstation. However,, we observed significant differences for several image interpretation parameters between individual residents and the home-based radiology subspecialist.
9168698#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The data confirm that significant value can be added to the interpretations of chest films by individual junior residents when a home-based thoracic radiologist uses teleradiology to provide expert interpretations. Accordingly,, it is reasonable to infer that on-line supervision by faculty subspecialists via teleradiology could be used to complement the scheduled visits that are being made now by individual faculty members of our institution to interpret films periodically with a radiology resident during overnight and weekend periods.

N?=?460 smokers (230 per arm) who will be recruited prior to randomization. Intervention group: use of a chat-bot with evidence-based contents to help quit smoking.
31796061#ABSTRACT#CONTROL GROUP#Usual treatment (according to the protocol for tobacco cessation by the Madrid Regional Health Service Main variable: Continuous nicotine withdrawal with chemical validation (carbon monoxide in exhaled air). Intention-to-treat analysis. Difference between groups in continuous abstinence rates at 6?months with their corresponding 95% confidence interval. A logistic regression model will be built to adjust for confounding factors.
31796061#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#First expected results in January 2020.
31796061#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Providing science-based evidence on the effectiveness of clinical interventions via information technologies,, without the physical presence of a professional,, is essential. In addition to being more efficient,, the characteristics of these interventions can improve effectiveness,, accessibility,, and adherence to treatment. From an ethics perspective,, this new type of intervention must be backed by scientific evidence to circumvent pressures from the market or particular interests,, improve patient safety,, and follow the standards of correct practices for clinical interventions.

20054838#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To evaluate the performance of a French version of the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (F-TICS-m) in identifying cognitive decline among elderly women.
20054838#ABSTRACT#METHODS#All women aged 72-86 participating in the 'Etude Epidémiologique auprès de Femmes de l'Education Nationale' (E3N) cohort and living in or near Paris constituted the target population of the validation study. Volunteer women (n = 120) underwent both a 20-min telephone interview and a face-to-face neuropsychological examination at an interval of few days (median interval: 10 days). The telephone interview included F-TICS-m,, as well as a recall of key elements of a short story,, arithmetic/verbal problems and two verbal fluency tests. Neuropsychological examination consisted of a standardized battery of cognitive tests (including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),, the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test-FCSRT,, Trailmaking tests A and B,, the similarities subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III,, etc.) the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living questionnaire,, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Neuropsychological examination led to classification of each subject as cognitively normal (n = 92) or impaired/demented (n = 28).
20054838#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#F-TICS-m showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.69). It correlated linearly with MMSE (Pearson's r = 0.72). Concurrent validity against the gold-standard classification was satisfactory,, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83. The combination of F-TICS-m and the other telephone tests had no additional effect on discrimination power in our sample (AUC = 0.81).
20054838#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#F-TICS-m is a valid instrument for assessing the overall cognitive status of French elderly women. Its validity in men and its reproducibility warrant further studies.

28400356#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to validate the Italian version of the eHealth Literacy Scale (I-eHEALS) in a community sample with a focus on its structural validity,, by applying psychometric techniques that account for item difficulty.
28400356#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two Web-based surveys were conducted among a total of 296 people living in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland (Ticino). After examining the latent variables underlying the observed variables of the Italian scale via principal component analysis (PCA),, fit indices for two alternative models were calculated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale structure was examined via parametric and nonparametric item response theory (IRT) analyses accounting for differences between items regarding the proportion of answers indicating high ability. Convergent validity was assessed by correlations with theoretically related constructs.
28400356#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#CFA showed a suboptimal model fit for both models. IRT analyses confirmed all items measure a single dimension as intended. Reliability and construct validity of the final scale were also confirmed. The contrasting results of factor analysis (FA) and IRT analyses highlight the importance of considering differences in item difficulty when examining health literacy scales.

34963668#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 26.9 million individuals a diabetes diagnosis rate of 9.4% in the United States had diabetes in 2018,, equivalent to 8.2% of the population (CDC,, 2020). Key government organizations have developed clinical quality indicators (CQIs) to ensure patients receive adequate care. The CQIs for comprehensive diabetes care are complex and often indicate a gap-in-care among vulnerable populations.
34963668#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To evaluate if the availability of point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in a mobile clinic increases CQIs adherence in vulnerable populations.
34963668#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This evidence-based clinical practice change project (EBCPCP) focused on improving diabetic CQIs in vulnerable populations by implementing POC HbA1c testing on a federally qualified health centers (FQHC) mobile clinic.
34963668#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results,, 125 individuals having received HbA1c results,, indicate having POC HgbA1c testing available on the mobile unit increased HbA1c testing. No patients had an HbA1c lab completed prior to the availability of POC testing.
34963668#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The availability of POC testing on a mobile clinic increases access to HbA1c for vulnerable populations which improves practice outcomes and increased CQI adherence.
34963668#ABSTRACT#IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING#The results of this EBCPCP indicate POC testing increases access to diagnostics and care.

21096156#ABSTRACT##One of the most promising and innovative developments in medicine are telemedical systems. The system PulmoTel 2010 and its internal validation are presented,, focusing on the system architecture,, hardware,, software and communication solutions. PulmoTel 2010 consists of a distant server managing users and medical devices,, as well as data transmission,, processing,, storage and presentation. The server cooperates with home units used by patients,, capable of performing lung function tests. All the elements communicate via the Internet,, however other media,, as wire and mobile telephony,, can be additionally applied in regions with a less developed infrastructure. Internal validation of the system was performed using data generated by application simulating features of a home unit. It demonstrated an appropriate operation of the overall system and fulfillment of the main objectives of the project.

25106438#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A net-based,, decision support system for diagnostic assessment and management of psychiatric disorders,, developed as part of a telepsychiatry service,, which aims to deliver mental health care to underserved population of remote areas in India is described. This paper presents the development and preliminary results of diagnostic validation of the application,, intended for use among adult patients. The bilingual (English and Hindi) diagnostic tool consists of a core diagnostic section comprising a screening sub-module and criteria-based diagnostic sub-modules for 18 adult psychiatric disorders,, and additional sections covering background information. The diagnostic tool of the application was examined among 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients,, by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical assessments led by a consultant psychiatrist,, on accuracy of diagnoses generated,, and examining the feasibility of its use.
25106438#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The screening sub-module had high sensitivity and high specificity,, low positive predictive values,, but high negative predictive values for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules,, there was moderate (kappa?=?0.4-0.6),, to substantial agreement (kappa?>?0.6) between diagnoses generated by the tool and consultants' diagnoses,, for all the disorders except dysthymia. Sensitivity was high barring a few disorders. Specificity was high for all the disorders,, positive predictive values were acceptable to high for most disorders,, and negative predictive values were consistently high. Completion rate was 100%; average time taken was five minutes for screening alone,, and 30 minutes for complete assessment with screening and criteria-based evaluation. A majority of the patients,, their relatives,, and interviewers were satisfied with the interview.
25106438#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The preliminary results indicated that despite some limitations,, the new diagnostic system was reasonably comprehensive,, time-efficient and feasible,, with an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Hence,, it appeared to be suitable for use as a telepsychiatric application.

15108117#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Thanks to advances in computer power and miniaturization technology,, portable electronic devices are now being used to assist physicians with various applications that extend far beyond Web browsing or sending e-mail. Handheld computers are used for electronic medical records,, billing,, coding,, and to enable convenient access to electronic journals for reference purposes. The results of diagnostic investigations,, such as laboratory results,, study reports,, and still radiographic pictures,, can also be downloaded into portable devices for later view. Handheld computer technology,, combined with wireless protocols and streaming video technology,, has the added potential to become a powerful educational tool for medical students and residents. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of transferring multimedia data in real time to a handheld computer via a wireless network and displaying them on the computer screens of clients at remote locations.
32308010#ABSTRACT##Technology-based dietary assessment has promising benefits on improving accuracy and reducing cost of dietary data collection. The validity of technology-based tools in children/adolescents was examined. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies published till September 2019. In total,, 26 studies with 29 validation-related estimations were selected; 13 web-based 24-hdietary recalls (image assisted; n?=?12,, drop-down food list; n?=?13),, 4 mobile applications and 3 web-based dietary records (image based; n?=?2 and image assisted; n?=?1,, drop-down food list; n?=?3) and 6 web-based food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) (image assisted; n?=?3). Fourteen studies were addressed to adolescents,, ten studies to children (principally 9-11?years old) and two studies to mixed study samples. Validation was mostly performed through 24-h dietary recalls and dietary records while in some cases objective methods were used. Image-assisted 24-h dietary recalls presented good level of agreement with paper-based methods,, yet principally in adolescents. Mobile-application dietary records with image-based facilities and drop-down food lists were found to accurately record dietary intake even when compared with objective methods. FFQs,, mainly examined in adolescents,, had good level of agreement with the "gold standard" dietary records method. The validity of technology-based methods could be supported yet various technical/methodological issues need better clarification.

29374105#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE#Up to 30% of acute stroke evaluations are deemed stroke mimics,, and these are common in telestroke as well. We recently published a risk prediction score for use during telestroke encounters to differentiate stroke mimics from ischemic cerebrovascular disease derived and validated in the Partners TeleStroke Network. Using data from 3 distinct US and European telestroke networks,, we sought to externally validate the TeleStroke Mimic (TM) score in a broader population.

29374105#KEYWORD##cohort studies
29374105#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We evaluated the TM score in 1930 telestroke consults from the University of Utah,, Georgia Regents University,, and the German TeleMedical Project for Integrative Stroke Care Network. We report the area under the curve in receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis with 95% confidence interval for our previously derived TM score in which lower TM scores correspond with a higher likelihood of being a stroke mimic.
29374105#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Based on final diagnosis at the end of the telestroke consultation,, there were 630 of 1930 (32.6%) stroke mimics in the external validation cohort. All 6 variables included in the score were significantly different between patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease versus stroke mimics. The TM score performed well (area under curve,, 0.72; 95% confidence interval,, 0.70-0.73; P<0.001),, similar to our prior external validation in the Partners National Telestroke Network.
29374105#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The TM score's ability to predict the presence of a stroke mimic during telestroke consultation in these diverse cohorts was similar to its performance in our original cohort. Predictive decision-support tools like the TM score may help highlight key clinical differences between mimics and patients with stroke during complex,, time-critical telestroke evaluations.

24337059#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#To evaluate the sonographic parameters related to morphological characteristics of pelvic adnexal masses by obtaining two-dimensional images by an observer presence,, forwarded electronically (via tele-ultrasound) in static and dynamic modes observers do not face (distance) for comparative analyzes inter intraobserver and to the validation of a second opinion.
24337059#ABSTRACT#METHODS#From March to August 2010 were selected 50 patients with adnexal mass viewing of the pelvic ultrasound. They were subjected to ultrasound for abdominal and transvaginal routes. The images were captured in static and dynamic modes,, electronically forwarded for evaluation of non-presence and two examiners evaluated according to morphological ultrasonographic parameters previously determined.
24337059#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The evaluators did not face in static and dynamic modes obtained almost perfect agreement for all morphological parameters with Kappa values between 0.6 and 0.8. There was no difference between the methods employed,, except for the morphological parameter papillary projection in the static mode,, in which the agreement was almost perfect (0.8) while in dynamic mode was substantial (0.6).
24337059#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The sonographic parameters of the features of adnexal masses pelvic sent by tele-ultrasound are capable of being validated for issuing a second opinion. There were no significant differences in the methodology used in the issue of tele-ultrasound images (static or dynamic) to characterize the composition of pelvic adnexal masses.

31642811#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is the most widely used instrument in health studies to measure individual's electronic health literacy. Nonetheless,, despite the rapid development of the online medical industry and increased rural-urban disparities in China,, very few studies have examined the characteristics of the eHEALS among Chinese rural people by using modern psychometric methods. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of eHEALS in a Chinese rural population by using both the classical test theory and item response theory methods.
31642811#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to develop a simplified Chinese version of the eHEALS (C-eHEALS) and evaluate its psychometric properties in a rural population.
31642811#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 543 rural internet users in West China. The internal reliability was assessed using the Cronbach alpha coefficient. A one-factor structure of the C-eHEALS was obtained via principal component analysis,, and fit indices for this structure were calculated using confirmatory factory analysis. Subsequently,, the item discrimination,, difficulty,, and test information were estimated via the graded response model. Additionally,, the criterion validity was confirmed through hypothesis testing.
31642811#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The C-eHEALS has good reliability. Both principal component analysis and confirmatory factory analysis showed that the scale has a one-factor structure. The graded response model revealed that all items of the C-eHEALS have response options that allow for differentiation between latent trait levels and the capture of substantial information regarding participants' ability.
31642811#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings indicate the high reliability and validity of the C-eHEALS and thus recommend its use for measuring eHealth literacy among the Chinese rural population.

29132622#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Personas are a canonical user-centered design method increasingly used in health informatics research. Personas-empirically-derived user archetypes-can be used by eHealth designers to gain a robust understanding of their target end users such as patients.
29132622#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Data were collected using standardized surveys and medical record abstraction from 32 older adults with heart failure recently hospitalized for acute heart failure exacerbation. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on a final dataset of n=30. Nonparametric analyses were used to identify differences between clusters on 30 clustering variables and seven outcome variables.
29132622#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Six clusters were produced,, ranging in size from two to eight patients per cluster. Clusters differed significantly on these biopsychosocial domains and subdomains: demographics (age,, sex); medical status (comorbid diabetes); functional status (exhaustion,, household work ability,, hygiene care ability,, physical ability); psychological status (depression,, health literacy,, numeracy); technology (Internet availability); healthcare system (visit by home healthcare,, trust in providers); social context (informal caregiver support,, cohabitation,, marital status); and economic context (employment status). Tabular and narrative persona descriptions provide an easy reference guide for informatics designers.
29132622#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Personas development using approaches such as clustering of structured survey data is an important tool for health informatics professionals. We describe insights from our study of patients with heart failure,, then recommend a generic ten-step personas development process. Methods strengths and limitations of the study and of personas development generally are discussed.

31502650#ABSTRACT##Assessment of the effectiveness of teledermatology has been hampered by the variety of outcome measures used,, limiting the possibility for meta-analysis. This systematic mapping review classified the outcome measurement instruments used in randomized controlled trials of teledermatology conducted between 2008 and 2018 using the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials taxonomy. Sixteen articles describing 12 studies were identified. Each trial used a mean of 3.7 outcome measurements (range 2-7) ,, with a total of 55 different instruments employed. Most instruments mapped on the "skin and subcutaneous tissue outcomes" domain. The most frequently used instrument (Dermatology Life Quality Index) was used in only 3 studies. Over 60% of the instruments used did not cite any evidence of validation. This mapping review provides a list of outcome measurement instruments that can be used as a resource when designing teledermatology trials in the future and provides the foundation for the development of a core outcome set.

23366352#ABSTRACT##Emerging high efficiency video compression methods and wider availability of wireless network infrastructure will significantly advance existing m-health applications. For medical video communications,, the emerging video compression and network standards support low-delay and high-resolution video transmission,, at the clinically acquired resolution and frame rates. Such advances are expected to further promote the adoption of m-health systems for remote diagnosis and emergency incidents in daily clinical practice. This paper compares the performance of the emerging high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard to the current state-of-the-art H.264/AVC standard. The experimental evaluation,, based on five atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound videos encoded at QCIF,, CIF,, and 4CIF resolutions demonstrates that 50% reductions in bitrate requirements is possible for equivalent clinical quality.
17000092#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Case-based reasoning has been of great importance in the development of many decision support applications. However,, relatively little effort has gone into investigating how new knowledge can be validated. Knowledge validation is important in dealing with imperfect data collected over time,, because inconsistencies in data do occur and adversely affect the performance of a diagnostic system.
17000092#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This paper consists of two parts. First,, it describes methods that enable the domain expert,, who may not be familiar with machine learning,, to interactively validate knowledge base of a Web-based teledermatology system. The validation techniques involve decision tree classification and formal concept analysis. Second,, it describes techniques to discover unusual relationships hidden in the dataset for building and updating a comprehensive knowledge base,, because the diagnostic performance of the system is highly dependent on the content thereof. Therefore,, in order to classify different kinds of diseases,, it is desirable to have a knowledge base that covers common as well as uncommon diagnoses.
17000092#ABSTRACT#RESULTS AND CONCLUSION#Evaluation results show that the knowledge validation techniques are effective in keeping the knowledge base consistent,, and that the query refinement techniques are useful in improving the comprehensiveness of the case base.

17848108#ABSTRACT##Tele-echocardiography could be a useful means for investigating heart pathologies on remotely-located patients. At present,, the main drawback with tele-echocardiography is the lack of a thorough protocol for the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of the transmitted images. Diagnostic accuracy in tele-echocardiography is not only a function of quantitative parameters but also of the subjective decision of the operator depending on his/her a priori knowledge based on complex internal models. In the framework of three Italian projects,, we defined and validated a wide-ranging protocol that considers not only the most common quantitative parameters in medical imaging,, but also the use of a dynamic phantom,, and subjective/partially subjective evaluations. The validation of tele-echocardiography systems chosen from those evaluated in the projects showed that the protocol was feasible. It permitted access to the degradation of the transmitted images and correlate quantitative and subjective analyses. The protocol was found suitable for tele-echocardiography systems but also for other tele-imaging applications,, where medical decision making is based on dynamic images.

16539751#ABSTRACT##A Canadian project (the National Initiative for Telehealth Guidelines) was established to develop telehealth guidelines that would be used by health professionals,, by telehealth providers as benchmarks for standards of service and by accrediting agencies for accreditation criteria. An environmental scan was conducted,, which focused on organizational,, human resource,, clinical and technological issues. A literature review,, a stakeholder survey (245 mail-outs,, 84 complete responses) and 48 key informant interviews were conducted. A framework of guidelines was developed and published as a preliminary step towards pan-Canadian policies. Interim recommendations were that organizations and jurisdictions might consider formal agreements to specify: (1) organizational interoperability; (2) technical interoperability; (3) personnel requirements; (4) quality and continuity-of-care responsibilities; (5) telehealth services; (6) remuneration; and (7) quality assurance processes. An additional recommendation was that flexible mechanisms were needed to ensure that accreditation criteria will be realistic and achievable in the context of rapid changes in technology,, service integration and delivery,, as well as in the context of operating telehealth services in remote or underserved areas.

26253144#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The physical components of the system consist of an image capture box,, a smartphone for wound image capture and a laptop for analyzing the wound image. The wound image assessment algorithms calculate the overall wound area,, color segmented wound areas,, and a healing score,, to provide a quantitative assessment of the wound healing status both for a single wound image and comparisons of subsequent images to an initial wound image.
26253144#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The system was evaluated by assessing foot ulcers for 12 patients in the Wound Clinic at University of Massachusetts Medical School. As performance measures,, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value for the wound area determination algorithm tested on 32 foot ulcer images was .68. The clinical validity of our healing score algorithm relative to the experienced clinicians was measured by Krippendorff's alpha coefficient (KAC) and ranged from .42 to .81.
26253144#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Our system provides a promising real-time method for wound assessment based on image analysis. Clinical comparisons indicate that the optimized mean-shift-based algorithm is well suited for wound area determination. Clinical evaluation of our healing score algorithm shows its potential to provide clinicians with a quantitative method for evaluating wound healing status.

10923912#ABSTRACT##Telepathology is a maturing technology that,, for a variety of reasons,, has not been widely deployed. In addition,, clinical validation is relatively modest compared with accepted telemedicine applications such as teleradiology. A prototype telepathology system (Tele-Path(sm)) featuring high-resolution images selected from a remote microscope site has been developed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). To validate the diagnostic efficacy of the system,, a prospective study was undertaken of parallel diagnoses by conventional microscopy and telepathology with a remotely operated microscope. Slides from 99 intraoperative consultations from 29 tissue/ organ sites in the University of Alabama Hospitals by 9 academic pathologists were used in the study. Each microscopic and telepathology diagnosis was compared with the final diagnosis rendered by a referee pathologist. Diagnoses were classified as correct,, false positive,, or false negative or classification error. Of the 99 frozen sections evaluated,, 3 cases were deferred. Of the remaining 96 cases,, 2 received incorrect diagnoses in both the microscopic and telepathology arms of the study. Three errors occurred only in the telepathology arm. There was 1 false-positive diagnosis,, 1 false-negative diagnosis,, and 1 classification error. Statistical analysis indicated no significant difference between telepathology and conventional microscopy. Qualitative data indicated that the pathologists were generally satisfied with the performance of the system. Telepathology using this system paradigm is sufficiently accurate for real time utilization in a complex surgical environment. Telepathology therefore may be an effective model to support the surgical services of hospitals lacking full-time pathology coverage,, resulting in full-time access to anatomic pathology services.
17310423#ABSTRACT##Digital retinal imaging with remote image interpretation (teleretinal imaging) is an emerging healthcare technology for screening patients for diabetic retinopathy (DR). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) convened an expert panel in 2001 to determine and resolve the requisite clinical,, quality and training,, information technology,, and healthcare infrastructure issues associated with deploying a teleretinal imaging system. The panel formulated consensus recommendations based on available literature and identified areas of uncertainty that merited further clarification or research. Subsequent VHA experience with teleretinal imaging and accumulated scientific evidence support nationwide regionalized deployment of teleretinal imaging to screen for DR. The goal is to screen approximately 75,,000 patients in the first year of the program,, which commenced in 2006. This program will increase patients' access to screening for DR,, provide outcomes data,, and offer a unique platform for systematically evaluating the role of this technology in the care of diabetic eye disease and routine eye-care practice.

21925836#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Pocket-size ultrasound has increased echocardiographic portability,, but expert point-of-care interpretation may not be readily available. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that remote interpretation on a smartphone with dedicated medical imaging software can be as accurate as on a workstation.
21925836#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Eighty-nine patients in a remote Honduran village underwent echocardiography by a nonexpert using a pocket-size ultrasound device. Images were sent for verification of point-of-care diagnosis to two expert echocardiographers in the United States reading on a workstation. Studies were then anonymized,, randomly ordered,, and reinterpreted on a smartphone with a dedicated,, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant application. Point-of-care diagnosis was considered accurate if any abnormal finding was matched and categorized at the same level of severity (mild,, moderate,, or severe) by either expert interpretation.
21925836#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The mean age was 54 ± 23 years,, and 57% of patients were women. The most common indications for echocardiography were arrhythmia (33%),, cardiomyopathy (28%),, and syncope (15%). Using the workstation,, point-of-care diagnoses were changed in 38% of cases by expert overread (41% left ventricular function correction,, 38% valvulopathy correction,, 18% poor image quality). Expert interobserver agreement was excellent at 82%,, with a Cohen's ? value of 0.82 (95% confidence interval,, 0.70-0.94). Intraobserver agreement comparing interpretations on workstations and smartphones was 90%,, with a Cohen's ? value of 0.86 (95% confidence interval,, 0.76-0.97),, signifying excellent intertechnology agreement.
21925836#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Remote expert echocardiographic interpretation can provide backup support to point-of-care diagnosis by nonexperts when read on a dedicated smartphone-based application. Mobile-to-mobile consultation may improve access in previously inaccessible locations to accurate echocardiographic interpretation by experienced cardiologists.

31710981#ABSTRACT#CONTEXT#Telemedicine has been increasingly used in healthcare to provide services to patients remotely. However,, prioritising patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) in telemedicine environment is challenging because it includes decision-making (DM) with regard to the emergency degree of each chronic disease for every patient.
31710981#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper proposes a novel technique for reorganisation of opinion order to interval levels (TROOIL) to prioritise the patients with MCDs in real-time remote health-monitoring system.
31710981#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The proposed TROOIL technique comprises six steps for prioritisation of patients with MCDs: (1) conversion of actual data into intervals; (2) rule generation; (3) rule ordering; (4) expert rule validation; (5) data reorganisation; and (6) criteria weighting and ranking alternatives within each rule. The secondary dataset of 500 patients from the most relevant study in a remote prioritisation area was adopted. The dataset contains three diseases,, namely,, chronic heart disease,, high blood pressure (BP) and low BP.
31710981#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The proposed TROOIL is an effective technique for prioritising patients with MCDs. In the objective validation,, remarkable differences were recognised among the groups' scores,, indicating identical ranking results. In the evaluation of issues within all scenarios,, the proposed framework has an advantage of 22.95% over the benchmark framework.
31710981#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Patients with the most severe MCD were treated first on the basis of their highest priority levels. The treatment for patients with less severe cases was delayed more than that for other patients.

19292630#ABSTRACT##This study aimed to understand how different types of knowledge have influenced the decision making process regarding the implementation of telehomecare in the organization of regional healthcare services in the Province of Quebec (Canada). A case study was conducted in order to explore how scientific evidence was integrated in the decision-making processes regarding the implementation of a telehomecare system in the Gaspésie-Magdalene Islands Health Region. A total of 14 semistructured interviews were completed with key organizational decision makers (regional managers,, organization managers,, healthcare professionals,, and technological managers). Two researchers independently carried out data analysis,, encouraging iterations and validation with study participants. The Gaspésie-Magdalene Islands Telehomecare Project is based on a technological solution named Intelligent Distance Patient Monitoring and constitutes a relevant example of the evolution of an e-health solution. Indeed,, the first reports of the experiment influenced decision makers to continue the deployment of the solution. Decision makers from all groups agreed on the importance of using past experience to avoid pitfalls and ensure an optimal decision-making process. They highlighted the importance of knowledge translation between sites as well as within sites. Knowledge translation played an important part in the success of the project. Efficient strategies to transfer evidence to organizational decision making have been identified such as an endusers forum,, where researchers provide support by sharing evidence with end-users and actively participate in knowledge translation.

22801481#ABSTRACT##This paper presents a methodology to transmit clinical video over wireless networks in real-time. A 3-D set partitioning in hierarchical trees compression prior to transmission is proposed. In order to guarantee the clinical quality of the compressed video,, a clinical evaluation specific to each video modality has to be made. This evaluation indicates the minimal transmission rate necessary for an accurate diagnosis. However,, the channel conditions produce errors and distort the video. A reliable application protocol is therefore proposed using a hybrid solution in which either retransmission or retransmission combined with forward error correction (FEC) techniques are used,, depending on the channel conditions. In order to analyze the proposed methodology,, the 2-D mode of an echocardiogram has been assessed. A bandwidth of 200 kbps is necessary to guarantee its clinical quality. The transmission using the proposed solution and retransmission and FEC techniques working separately have been simulated and compared in high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks. The proposed protocol achieves guaranteed clinical quality for bit error rates higher than with the other protocols,, being for a mobile speed of 60 km/h up to 3.3 times higher for HSUPA and 10 times for WiMAX.

23705961#ABSTRACT##The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is a large integrated healthcare system with a mission to care for over 5.6 million Veteran patients annually. VHA,, like other healthcare organizations,, is challenged with providing access to care to those it serves when they live at a distance from a physical site of care. VHA has embraced telehealth as a way of delivering care at a distance and increase access to specialty care services. Since 2003 VHA has developed large national telehealth networks that provided care to 497,,342 patients in fiscal year 2012,, who received 1,,429,,424 episodes of care,, and is recognized as a national leader in this field. To ensure the safety and effectiveness of its telehealth networks in their delivery of care VHA has implemented a dedicated quality management (QM) program for telehealth. QM data for telehealth are reviewed at 3-month intervals,, and the procedures and processes in place to support telehealth in VHA are assessed biannually in an internal accreditation process called "Telehealth Conditions of Participation." This collegial,, nonadversarial process has ensured that all designated telehealth programs meet minimal standards and disseminate best practice. As a result of VHA's QM program,, telehealth services in VHA meet consistently high clinical outcomes and have received no adverse Joint Commission citations. The Joint Commission regularly assesses patients managed via telehealth under its tracer methodology reviews.

22254674#ABSTRACT##The design of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) products is a very demanding challenge. AAL products creation is a complex iterative process which must accomplish exhaustive prerequisites about accessibility and usability. In this process the early detection of errors is crucial to create cost-effective systems. Computer-assisted tools can suppose a vital help to usability designers in order to avoid design errors. Specifically computer simulation of products in AAL environments can be used in all the design phases to support the validation. In this paper,, a computer simulation tool for supporting usability designers in the creation of innovative AAL products is presented. This application will benefit their work saving time and improving the final system functionality.

29132455#ABSTRACT##British Columbia Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) uses an internationally recognized Medical Priority Dispatch System to assign appropriate responses to 9-1-1 calls based on patients' clinical acuity. In 2015,, 71% of Omega calls (classified as calls involving low acuity injuries) were assigned an ambulance. To better meet patients' needs,, BCEHS collaborated with HealthLink BC's Nursing Services (HLBC NS) to audit over 2,,000 calls. Based on the results,, three Plan,, Do,, Study,, Act (PDSA) cycles were implemented,, yielding a 35% decrease in ambulances assigned and a 173% increase in referrals to HLBC NS to provide more suitable support. Ultimately,, the interventions allowed these ambulances to be reallocated to more critical patients.

25681100#ABSTRACT##Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) makes an efficient and convenient connection between patient(s)/user(s) at home and doctor(s) at a clinical center. To ensure secure connection between the two entities (patient(s)/user(s),, doctor(s)),, user authentication is enormously important for the medical server. In this regard,, many authentication protocols have been proposed in the literature only for accessing single medical server. In order to fix the drawbacks of the single medical server,, we have primarily developed a novel architecture for accessing several medical services of the multi-medical server,, where a user can directly communicate with the doctor of the medical server securely. Thereafter,, we have developed a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for TMIS system using cryptographic one-way hash function. We have analyzed the security of our proposed authentication scheme through both formal and informal security analysis. Furthermore,, we have simulated the proposed scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool and showed that the scheme is secure against the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal security analysis is also presented which confirms that the protocol has well security protection on the relevant security attacks. The security and performance comparison analysis confirm that the proposed protocol not only provides security protection on the above mentioned attacks,, but it also achieves better complexities along with efficient login and password change phase.
27332335#ABSTRACT##This workshop will explore the challenges in translating existing health interventions to new e-health delivery mechanisms.

19162538#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Advanced information technologies joined to the increasing use of continuous medical devices for monitoring and treatment,, have made possible the definition of a new telemedical diabetes care scenario based on a hand-held Personal Assistant (PA). This paper describes the architecture,, functionality and implementation of the PA,, which communicates different medical devices in a personal wireless network.
19162538#ABSTRACT#DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM#The PA is a mobile system for patients with diabetes connected to a telemedical center. The software design follows a modular approach to make the integration of medical devices or new functionalities independent from the rest of its components. Physicians can remotely control medical devices from the telemedicine server through the integration of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and mobile GPRS communications. Data about PA modules' usage and patients' behavior evaluation come from a pervasive tracing system implemented into the PA.
19162538#ABSTRACT#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#The PA architecture has been technically validated with commercially available medical devices during a clinical experiment for ambulatory monitoring and expert feedback through telemedicine. The clinical experiment has allowed defining patients' patterns of usage and preferred scenarios and it has proved the Personal Assistant's feasibility. The patients showed high acceptability and interest in the system as recorded in the usability and utility questionnaires. Future work will be devoted to the validation of the system with automatic control strategies from the telemedical center as well as with closed-loop control algorithms.

10429296#ABSTRACT##The advent of new computer technologies can appear as a revolution in surgical teaching,, as well as in the planing and realization of surgical procedures. The introduction of a camera into the body of a patient,, allowing the visual display of the operative procedure through the use of a miniaturized camera,, constitutes the greatest change that the surgical world has experienced at the end of this century: mini-invasive surgery is born. This revolution also predicts further changes: the development of telecommunication devices applied to medicine (tele-education,, tele-training,, tele-mentoring,, tele-proctoring and tele-accreditation),, constitutes the basis of cybersurgery or virtual reality allowing the merging of the concepts of tele-presence and telemanipulation. These new concepts were developed at the European Institute of TeleSurgery at Strasbourg. The TESUS project developed the use of surgical images and data transmission through the realization of international multi-site video conferences between surgeons. The WEBS project created the first virtual university concept by placing surgical techniques at the surgeon's disposal through the Internet. The HESSOS project uses virtual reality as a surgical simulation system. The MASTER project allows the development of the concept of distant telemanipulation. It is now possible to face surgical teaching outside of the restricted University framework,, and to conceive teaching on a world-wide level,, offering the practitioner unimaginable possibilities of formation,, training and the planning of surgical procedures.
21265275#ABSTRACT##Issues that healthcare leaders should consider in determining whether to develop a teleintensivist program to support physician coverage in the ICU include those related to: Coverage. Scope. IT capabilities. Licensure of participating physicians and accreditation of the hospital. Payment. Potential impact on other ICU services. Performance measurement. Training and education.

31032473#ABSTRACT##Over the last several years,, there has been rapid growth of digital technologies attempting to transform healthcare. Unique features of digital medicine technology lead to both challenges and opportunities for testing and validation. Yet little guidance exists to help a health system decide whether to undertake a pilot test of new technology,, move right to full-scale adoption or start somewhere in between. To navigate this complexity,, this paper proposes an algorithm to help choose the best path toward validation and adoption. Special attention is paid to considering whether the needs of patients with limited digital skills,, equipment (e.g.,, smart-phones) and connectivity (e.g.,, data plans) have been considered in technology development and deployment. The algorithm reflects the collective experience of 20+ health systems and academic institutions that have established the Network of Digital Evidence for Health,, NODE. Health,, plus insights from existing clinical research taxonomies,, syntheses or frameworks for assessing technology or for reporting clinical trials.
36208904#ABSTRACT##As a result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic the use of telemedicine and remote assessments for patients has increased exponentially,, enabling healthcare professionals to reduce the need for in-person clinical visits and,, consequently,, reduce the exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This development has been aided by increased guidance on digital health technologies and cybersecurity measures,, as well as reimbursement options within healthcare systems. Having been able to continue to connect with people with Parkinson's Disease (PwP,, PD) has been crucial,, since many saw their symptoms worsen over the pandemic. Inspite of the success of telemedicine,, sometimes even enabling delivery of treatment and research,, further validation and a unified framework are necessary to measure the true benefit to both clinical outcomes and health economics. Moreover,, the use of telemedicine seems to have been biased towards people from a white background,, those with higher education,, and reliable internet connections. As such,, efforts should be pursued by being inclusive of all PwP,, regardless of geographical area and ethnic background. In this chapter,, we describe the effect he Covid-19 pandemic has had on the use of telemedicine for care and research in people with PD,, the limiting factors for further rollout,, and how telemedicine might develop further.

30470678#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Until now,, the use of technology in health care was driven mostly by the assumptions about the benefits of electronic health (eHealth) rather than its evidence. It is noticeable that the magnitude of evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth is not proportionate to the number of interventions that are regularly conducted. Reliable evidence generated through comprehensive evaluation of eHealth interventions may accelerate the growth of eHealth for long-term successful implementation and help to experience eHealth benefits in an enhanced way.
30470678#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to understand how the evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth can be generated through evaluation. Hence,, we aim to discern (1) how evaluation is conducted in distinct eHealth intervention phases,, (2) the aspects of effectiveness and efficiency that are typically evaluated during eHealth interventions,, and (3) how eHealth interventions are evaluated in practice.
30470678#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the evaluation methods for eHealth interventions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. We searched Google Scholar and Scopus for the published papers that addressed the evaluation of eHealth or described an eHealth intervention study. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps.
30470678#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The importance of evidence in eHealth has not been discussed as rigorously as have the diverse evaluation approaches and evaluation frameworks. Further research directed toward evidence-based evaluation can not only improve the quality of intervention studies but also facilitate successful long-term implementation of eHealth in general. We conclude that the development of more robust and comprehensive evaluation of eHealth studies or an improved validation of evaluation methods could ease the transferability of results among similar studies. Thus,, the resources can be used for supplementary research in eHealth.

30470678#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We intended to see how the process of evaluation unfolds in distinct phases of an eHealth intervention. We revealed that in practice and in several conceptual papers,, evaluation is performed at the end of the intervention. There are some studies that discuss the importance of conducting evaluation throughout the intervention; however,, in practice,, we found no case study that followed this. For our second research question,, we discovered aspects of efficiency and effectiveness that are proposed to be assessed during interventions. The aspects that were recurrent in the conceptual papers include clinical,, human and social,, organizational,, technological,, cost,, ethical and legal,, and transferability. However,, the case studies reviewed only evaluate the clinical and human and social aspects. At the end of the paper,, we discussed a novel approach to look into the evaluation. Our intention was to stir up a discussion around this approach with the hope that it might be able to gather evidence in a comprehensive and credible way.
20946304#ABSTRACT##Diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) is one of the major complications of diabetes,, and it can lead to foot amputations. It is very important to assure good medical care for diabetic patients not only during their stay at hospital but also at home. Telecare can be one good solution for extending medical care to patients' homes. There are some reports regarding the application of new technologies in this field. The standard current model of telecare of DFS includes experts at hospital who conduct clinical examinations and decision making at a distance,, in close cooperation with a visiting nurse and the patient. In the present paper a new paradigm of the DFS's telecare is introduced,, which eliminates the visiting nurse. The designed and developed TeleDiaFoS system consists of a traditional database and mobile patient's module (PM) allowing for documentation of the foot images as well as the results of blood glucose and blood pressure measurements taken by the patient himself at home. A 2-year validation of the TeleDiaFoS system on 10 DFS patients (3 months each) proved its usefulness and led to acceptance of this type of technical support by patients and physicians. The designed and developed system and proposed sterilization procedure of the PM have been found to be easy to use by the patient at home.

32217504#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of mobile health apps (MHAs),, which are developed to promote healthy behaviors,, prevent disease onset,, manage and cure diseases,, or assist with rehabilitation measures,, has exploded. App store star ratings and descriptions usually provide insufficient or even false information about app quality,, although they are popular among end users. A rigorous systematic approach to establish and evaluate the quality of MHAs is urgently needed. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) is an assessment tool that facilitates the objective and systematic evaluation of the quality of MHAs. However,, a German MARS is currently not available.
32217504#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to translate and validate a German version of the MARS (MARS-G).
32217504#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original 19-item MARS was forward and backward translated twice,, and the MARS-G was created. App description items were extended,, and 104 MHAs were rated twice by eight independent bilingual researchers,, using the MARS-G and MARS. The internal consistency,, validity,, and reliability of both scales were assessed. Mokken scale analysis was used to investigate the scalability of the overall scores.
32217504#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The retranslated scale showed excellent alignment with the original MARS. Additionally,, the properties of the MARS-G were comparable to those of the original MARS. The internal consistency was good for all subscales (ie,, omega ranged from 0.72 to 0.91). The correlation coefficients (r) between the dimensions of the MARS-G and MARS ranged from 0.93 to 0.98. The scalability of the MARS (H=0.50) and MARS-G (H=0.48) were good.
32217504#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MARS-G is a reliable and valid tool for experts and stakeholders to assess the quality of health apps in German-speaking populations. The overall score is a reliable quality indicator. However,, further studies are needed to assess the factorial structure of the MARS and MARS-G.

31305192#ABSTRACT##Ambient measurement systems (AMSs) can enable continuous assessment of functional performance at home,, increasing the availability of data for monitoring of neuromuscular disease. An AMS passively measures movement whenever someone is in range of the sensor,, without the need for any wearable sensors. The current study evaluates the performance of an AMS for three metrics associated with functional assessments in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): ambulation speed,, rise-to-stand speed and arm-raise speed. Healthy paediatric subjects performed a series of functional tasks and were graded by both a human rater and an AMS. Linear mixed-effect models were fit to calculate agreement between the two measurement methods. For all activities,, the AMS and human rater supplied similar measurements of average speed,, with correlation coefficients of 0.76-0.92 and systematic differences ranging in magnitude from 0 to 0.48 m per second. The largest systematic difference was for the 10-m run,, which was likely due to human rater reaction time. Systematic differences in arm-raise measurements were due to incomplete execution of movements by test participants. These results are consistent with previous studies comparing automated and manual measurements of movement. This study demonstrates that an AMS device is able to measure ambulation speed,, rise-to-stand speed and arm-raise speed in a paediatric population in a controlled setting without the need for complicated installation,, calibration or worn sensors.

33768279#ABSTRACT##The use of medical apps is becoming increasingly important as it offers new solutions in healthcare. Steadily growing computing and storage capacities in combination with high-precision sensors make smartphones effective tools for medical diagnostics and treatment. The use of this technology offers immense advantages,, such as direct availability or independence from opening times. However,, it also harbors risks such as unfiltered data storage and transmission. The consulting physician should exercise great care when selecting and recommending apps,, particularly since only a few have been certified as medical devices to date. There is a steadily growing range of products on the market for otorhinolaryngology. The scientific evidence and quality of the apps vary widely,, but tools exist for their validation by physicians and patients. The present training course is intended to help increase knowledge in this new,, rapidly developing area.

26506354#ABSTRACT##This paper introduces a human posture tracking platform to identify the human postures of sitting,, standing or lying down,, based on a smartwatch. This work develops such a system as a proof-of-concept study to investigate a smartwatch's ability to be used in future remote health monitoring systems and applications. This work validates the smartwatches' ability to track the posture of users accurately in a laboratory setting while reducing the sampling rate to potentially improve battery life,, the first steps in verifying that such a system would work in future clinical settings. The algorithm developed classifies the transitions between three posture states of sitting,, standing and lying down,, by identifying these transition movements,, as well as other movements that might be mistaken for these transitions. The system is trained and developed on a Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch,, and the algorithm was validated through a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation of 20 subjects. The system can identify the appropriate transitions at only 10 Hz with an F-score of 0.930,, indicating its ability to effectively replace smart phones,, if needed.
36212608#ABSTRACT##The management of chronic wounds in the elderly such as pressure injury (also known as bedsore or pressure ulcer) is increasingly important in an ageing population. Accurate classification of the stage of pressure injury is important for wound care planning. Nonetheless,, the expertise required for staging is often not available in a residential care home setting. Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based computer vision techniques have opened up opportunities to harness the inbuilt camera in modern smartphones to support pressure injury staging by nursing home carers. In this paper,, we summarise the recent development of smartphone or tablet-based applications for wound assessment. Furthermore,, we present a new smartphone application (app) to perform real-time detection and staging classification of pressure injury wounds using a deep learning-based object detection system,, YOLOv4. Based on our validation set of 144 photos,, our app obtained an overall prediction accuracy of 63.2%. The per-class prediction specificity is generally high (85.1%-100%),, but have variable sensitivity: 73.3% (stage 1 vs. others),, 37% (stage 2 vs. others),, 76.7 (stage 3 vs. others),, 70% (stage 4 vs. others),, and 55.6% (unstageable vs. others). Using another independent test set,, 8 out of 10 images were predicted correctly by the YOLOv4 model. When deployed in a real-life setting with two different ambient brightness levels with three different Android phone models,, the prediction accuracy of the 10 test images ranges from 80 to 90%,, which highlight the importance of evaluation of mobile health (mHealth) application in a simulated real-life setting. This study details the development and evaluation process and demonstrates the feasibility of applying such a real-time staging app in wound care management.

26242748#ABSTRACT##Telecare medicine information systems (TMIS) have been known as an effective mechanism to increase quality and security of healthcare services. In other to the protection of patient privacy,, several authentication schemes have been proposed in TMIS,, however,, most of them have a security problems. Recently,, Das proposed a secure and robust password-based remote user authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system. However,, in this paper,, we show that his scheme have some security flaws. Then,, we shall propose a secure authentication scheme to overcome their weaknesses. We prove the proposed scheme with random oracle and also use the BAN logic to prove the correctness of the proposed scheme. Furthermore,, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool.

22692865#ABSTRACT##We address numerical versus experimental design and testing of miniature implantable antennas for biomedical telemetry in the medical implant communications service band (402-405 MHz). A model of a novel miniature antenna is initially proposed for skin implantation,, which includes varying parameters to deal with fabrication-specific details. An iterative design-and-testing methodology is further suggested to determine the parameter values that minimize deviations between numerical and experimental results. To assist in vitro testing,, a low-cost technique is proposed for reliably measuring the electric properties of liquids without requiring commercial equipment. Validation is performed within a specific prototype fabrication/testing approach for miniature antennas. To speed up design while providing an antenna for generic skin implantation,, investigations are performed inside a canonical skin-tissue model. Resonance,, radiation,, and safety performance of the proposed antenna is finally evaluated inside an anatomical head model. This study provides valuable insight into the design of implantable antennas,, assessing the significance of fabrication-specific details in numerical simulations and uncertainties in experimental testing for miniature structures. The proposed methodology can be applied to optimize antennas for several fabrication/testing approaches and biotelemetry applications.

34300509#ABSTRACT##Assessment of health and physical function using smartphones (mHealth) has enormous potential due to the ubiquity of smartphones and their potential to provide low cost,, scalable access to care as well as frequent,, objective measurements,, outside of clinical environments. Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance,, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex,, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive,, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed,, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app,, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures. In addition,, analysis of the quantitative balance features produced seems to suggest that unsupervised,, self-directed assessment of balance in the home is feasible.
32942794#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The unexpected COVID-19 crisis has disrupted medical education and patient care in unprecedented ways. Despite the challenges,, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust "temporary" solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine.
32942794#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education,, continuing medical education (CME) activities,, residency and fellowship programs,, specialty society meetings,, and telemedicine,, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to "business as usual" in the health-care sector.

32942794#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients,, virtual meetings with colleagues,, and online interviews have been introduced,, and many trainees are "techno-omnivores" who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now,, and their use,, practicality,, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs,, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether,, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-to-face experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this,, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe,, secure,, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling,, informed consent,, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example,, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy,, although it is likely that after the crisis,, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits.
32942794#ABSTRACT#LIMITATIONS#The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed.
32942794#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era.

32289490#ABSTRACT##Retrospective evaluation of a deep learning-derived retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) vascular severity score in an operational ROP screening program demonstrated high diagnostic performance for detection of type 2 or worse ROP. To our knowledge,, this is the first report in the literature that evaluated the use of artificial intelligence for ROP screening and represents a proof of concept. With further prospective validation,, this technology might improve the accuracy,, efficiency,, and objectivity of diagnosis and facilitate earlier detection of disease progression in patients with potentially blinding ROP.

33414261#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52,, 95%),, reinforce smoking cessation (n=46,, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44,, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds,, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities,, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%),, providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%),, reinforcing smoking cessation (81%),, deciding whether patients should seek in-person care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%).

30446482#ABSTRACT##Engagement in electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) behavior change interventions is thought to be important for intervention effectiveness,, though what constitutes engagement and how it enhances efficacy has been somewhat unclear in the literature. Recently published detailed definitions and conceptual models of engagement have helped to build consensus around a definition of engagement and improve our understanding of how engagement may influence effectiveness. This work has helped to establish a clearer research agenda. However,, to test the hypotheses generated by the conceptual modules,, we need to know how to measure engagement in a valid and reliable way. The aim of this viewpoint is to provide an overview of engagement measurement options that can be employed in eHealth and mHealth behavior change intervention evaluations,, discuss methodological considerations,, and provide direction for future research. To identify measures,, we used snowball sampling,, starting from systematic reviews of engagement research as well as those utilized in studies known to the authors. A wide range of methods to measure engagement were identified,, including qualitative measures,, self-report questionnaires,, ecological momentary assessments,, system usage data,, sensor data,, social media data,, and psychophysiological measures. Each measurement method is appraised and examples are provided to illustrate possible use in eHealth and mHealth behavior change research. Recommendations for future research are provided,, based on the limitations of current methods and the heavy reliance on system usage data as the sole assessment of engagement. The validation and adoption of a wider range of engagement measurements and their thoughtful application to the study of engagement are encouraged.

24111391#ABSTRACT##Automated retina image analysis has reached a high level of maturity in recent years,, and thus the question of how validation is performed in these systems is beginning to grow in importance. One application of retina image analysis is in telemedicine,, where an automated system could enable the automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases as a low-cost method for broad-based screening. In this work,, we discuss our experiences in developing a telemedical network for retina image analysis,, including our progression from a manual diagnosis network to a more fully automated one. We pay special attention to how validations of our algorithm steps are performed,, both using data from the telemedicine network and other public databases.

11321704#ABSTRACT##Remote monitoring of crew,, spacecraft,, and environmental health has always been an integral part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) operations. Crew safety and mission success face a number of challenges in outerspace,, including physiological adaptations to microgravity,, radiation exposure,, extreme temperatures and vacuum,, and psychosocial reactions to space flight. The NASA effort to monitor and maintain crew health,, system performance,, and environmental integrity in space flight is a sophisticated and coordinated program of telemedicine combining cutting-edge engineering with medical expertise. As missions have increased in complexity,, NASA telemedicine capabilities have grown apace,, underlying its role in the field. At the same time,, the terrestrial validation of telemedicine technologies to bring healthcare to remote locations provides feedback,, improvement,, and enhancement of the space program. As NASA progresses in its space exploration program,, astronauts will join missions lasting months,, even years,, that take them millions of miles from home. These long-duration missions necessitate further technological breakthroughs in tele-operations and autonomous technology. Earth-based monitoring will no longer be real-time,, requiring telemedicine capabilities to advance with future explorers as they travel deeper into space. The International Space Station will serve as a testbed for the telemedicine technologies to enable future missions as well as improve the quality of healthcare delivery on Earth.
18560095#ABSTRACT##Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are revolutionizing how healthcare systems deliver top-quality care to citizens. In this way,, Open Source Software (OSS) has demonstrated to be an important strategy to spread ICTs use. Several human and technological barriers in adopting OSS for healthcare have been identified. Human barriers include user acceptance,, limited support,, technical skillfulness,, awareness,, resistance to change,, etc.,, while Technological barriers embrace need for open standards,, heterogeneous OSS developed without normalization and metrics,, lack of initiatives to evaluate existing health OSS and need for quality control and functional validation. The goals of PESCA project are to create a platform of interoperable modules to evaluate,, classify and validate good practices in health OSS. Furthermore,, a normalization platform will provide interoperable solutions in the fields of healthcare services,, health surveillance,, health literature,, and health education,, knowledge and research. Within the platform,, the first goal to achieve is the setup of the collaborative work infrastructure. The platform is being organized as a Social Network which works to evaluate five scopes of every existing open source tools for eHealth: Open Source Software,, Quality,, Pedagogical,, Security and privacy and Internationalization/I18N. In the meantime,, the knowledge collected from the networking will configure a Good Practice Repository on eHealth promoting the effective use of ICT on behalf of the citizen's health.

36307160#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Healthcare professionals (HCPs) often recommend their patients to use a specific mHealth app as part of health promotion,, disease prevention and patient self-management. There has been a significant growth in the number of HCPs downloading and using mobile health (mHealth) apps. Most mHealth apps that are available in app stores employ a 'star rating' system. This is based on user feedback on an app,, but is highly subjective. Thus,, the identification of quality mHealth apps which are deemed fit for purpose can be a difficult task for HCPs. Currently,, there is no unified,, validated standard guidelines for assessment of mHealth apps for patient safety,, which can be used by HCPs. The Modified Enlight Suite (MES) is a quality assessment framework designed to provide a means for HCPs to evaluate mHealth apps before they are recommended to patients. MES was adapted from the original Enlight Suite for international use through a Delphi method,, followed by preliminary validation process among a population predominantly consisting of medical students. This study aims to evaluate the applicability and validity of the MES,, by HCPs,, in low,, middle and high income country settings.
36307160#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS#MES will be evaluated through a mixed-method study,, consisting of qualitative (focus group) and quantitative (survey instruments) research,, in three target countries: Malawi (low income),, South Africa (middle income) and Ireland (high income). The focus groups will be conducted through Microsoft Teams (Microsoft,, Redmond,, Washington,, USA) and surveys will be conducted online using Qualtrics (Qualtrics International,, Seattle,, Washington,, USA). Participants will be recruited through the help of national representatives in Malawi (Mzuzu University),, South Africa (University of Fort Hare) and Ireland (University College Cork) by email invitation. Data analysis for the focus group will be by the means of thematic analysis. Data analysis for the survey will use descriptive statistics and use Cronbach alpha as an indicator of internal consistency of the MES. The construct validity of the mHealth app will be assessed by computing the confirmatory factor analysis using Amos.
36307160#ABSTRACT#ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION#The study has received ethical approval from the Social Research Ethics Committee (SREC) SREC/SOM/03092021/1 at University College Cork,, Ireland,, Malawi Research Ethics Committee (MREC),, Malawi MZUNIREC/DOR/21/59 and Inter-Faculty Research Ethics Committee (IFREC) of University of Fort Hare (REC-2?70?710-028-RA). The results of the study will be disseminated through the internet,, peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

34020375#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE#The massive increase,, in the Internet of Things applications,, has greatly evolved technological aspects of human life. The drastic development of IoT based smart healthcare services have layout the smart process models to facilitate all stakeholders (e.g. patients,, doctors,, hospitals etc.) and made it an important social-economic concern. There are variety of smart healthcare services like remote patient monitoring,, diagnostic,, disease specific remote treatments and telemedicine. Many trending Internet of Health Things research and development are done in a very disjoint and independent fashion providing solutions and guidelines for variant diseases,, medical resources and remote services management. These expositions work over many shared resources such as health facilities for patient and human in healthcare system.
34020375#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This research discusses the ontology for merging methods to form an integrated platform with shared knowledge of smart healthcare services. The proposed process model creates an ontological framework of integrated healthcare services,, which are firstly defined using ontologies and lately integrated over similarities,, differences,, dependencies and other semantic relations. The data and process requirements for service integration facility is derived from various smart healthcare services.
34020375#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The proposed model is evaluated using two-step ontological modeling testing method,, applied at the ontological framework of integrated smart health services. First evaluation step has targeted the model consistency validation using reasoning tool while querying tools are used to validate the retrieved data entities and relations among them for predefined use-cases.
34020375#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The research concluded with a novel approach for smart health service integration using ontological modeling and merging techniques. The model efficiency enhancement and query optimization methods are listed in future tasks of the research.

18181818#ABSTRACT##Increasing use of information and communication technologies is said to be transforming health care. Telehealthcare enables medical consultations to be conducted between patients and health professionals across different locations. Such technologies imply new relationships between patients and health professionals. This study aimed to understand how policy and practice in relation to telehealthcare suggests new conceptualisations of 'the patient'. In-depth semistructured interviews (n = 38) were conducted with key informants from across the UK,, known to have involvement or interest in telehealthcare from a variety of perspectives: health professionals (n = 11),, patient advocates (n = 7),, telemedicine experts (n = 6),, policy-makers (n = 4),, administrators (n = 4),, researchers (n = 3) and technologists (n = 3). Interviews were conducted either in person or over the telephone,, and were audio-recorded. Data were analysed thematically with ongoing cross-validation of data interpretation between members of the research team. The results indicated divergent views about the role of the patient,, although accounts of patients becoming 'educated self-managers',, taking on a more active role in their healthcare,, were predominant. Beliefs about the impact of telehealthcare on patients were focused on perceived 'priorities' such as access,, location of services,, confidentiality and choice; however,, there remains little understanding of the trade-offs that patients are willing to make in the context of technologically mediated health care. The results also highlight ideas around how patients relate to technologies; the extent to which technologies might fragment care and medicine in new or unexpected ways,, and participation and absence of patients in decision-making about policies and services. The results of this study have important implications for the ways in which relationships between health professionals and patients are managed in practice,, and raise important questions for public participation in service development.

Here,, we evaluated the equivalency of a novel videoconference protocol for administering the NIHTB-CB. Since our protocol required repeated assessments,, we further explored the NIHTB-CB's practice effect.
29927713#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#Twenty-five healthy participants completed the NIHTB-CB under two separate conditions 4 weeks apart. The standard condition followed the recommended administration protocol,, whereas the videoconference condition had the examiner and participant in separate rooms but able to communicate over videoconference. A linear mixed-model analysis was performed to explore the fixed effect of testing condition and time on NIHTB-CB performance.

33370240#ABSTRACT##With advances in digital stethoscopes,, internet of things,, signal processing and machine learning,, chest sounds can be easily collected and transmitted to the cloud for remote monitoring and diagnosis. However,, low quality of recordings complicates remote monitoring and diagnosis,, particularly for neonatal care. This paper proposes a new method to objectively and automatically assess the signal quality to improve the accuracy and reliability of heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) estimation from noisy neonatal chest sounds. A total of 88 10-second long chest sounds were taken from 76 preterm and full-term babies. Six annotators independently assessed the signal quality,, number of detectable beats,, and breathing periods from these recordings. For quality classification,, 187 and 182 features were extracted from heart and lung sounds,, respectively. After feature selection,, class balancing,, and hyperparameter optimization,, a dynamic binary classification model was trained. Then HR and BR were automatically estimated from the chest sound and several approaches were compared.The results of subject-wise leave-one-out cross-validation,, showed that the model distinguished high and low quality recordings in the test set with 96% specificity,, 81% sensitivity and 93% accuracy for heart sounds,, and 86% specificity,, 69% sensitivity and 82% accuracy for lung sounds. The HR and BR estimated from high quality sounds resulted in significantly less median absolute error (4 bpm and 12 bpm difference,, respectively) compared to those from low quality sounds. The methods presented in this work,, facilitates automated neonatal chest sound auscultation for future telehealth applications.
29927713#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Across all three NIHTB-CB composite scores (total,, fluid,, and crystallized cognition),, no significant fixed effect of administration condition was found. A significant practice effect was observed for the fluid and total cognition composite scores over a 29.0 (±2.1) day test-retest interval.
29927713#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our novel videoconference protocol for the NIHTB-CB is equivalent to the standard protocol in healthy participants,, and may provide a solution for researchers seeking to engage study participants at remote sites. If the NIHTB-CB is used longitudinally to monitor patients,, corrections for repeated measures may be required.

37166816#ABSTRACT#IMPORTANCE#Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) telemedicine screening programs have been found to be effective,, but they rely on widefield digital fundus imaging (WDFI) cameras,, which are expensive,, making them less accessible in low- to middle-income countries. Cheaper,, smartphone-based fundus imaging (SBFI) systems have been described,, but these have a narrower field of view (FOV) and have not been tested in a real-world,, operational telemedicine setting.
37166816#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To assess the efficacy of SBFI systems compared with WDFI when used by technicians for ROP screening with both artificial intelligence (AI) and human graders.
37166816#ABSTRACT#DESIGN,, SETTING,, AND PARTICIPANTS#This prospective cross-sectional comparison study took place as a single-center ROP teleophthalmology program in India from January 2021 to April 2022. Premature infants who met normal ROP screening criteria and enrolled in the teleophthalmology screening program were included. Those who had already been treated for ROP were excluded.
37166816#ABSTRACT#EXPOSURES#All participants had WDFI images and from 1 of 2 SBFI devices,, the Make-In-India (MII) Retcam or Keeler Monocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope (MIO) devices. Two masked readers evaluated zone,, stage,, plus,, and vascular severity scores (VSS,, from 1-9) in all images. Smartphone images were then stratified by patient into training (70%),, validation (10%),, and test (20%) data sets and used to train a ResNet18 deep learning architecture for binary classification of normal vs preplus or plus disease,, which was then used for patient-level predictions of referral warranted (RW)- and treatment requiring (TR)-ROP.
37166816#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES#Sensitivity and specificity of detection of RW-ROP,, and TR-ROP by both human graders and an AI system and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of grader-assigned VSS. Sensitivity and specificity were compared between the 2 SBFI systems using Pearson ?2testing.
37166816#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 156 infants (312 eyes; mean [SD] gestational age,, 33.0 [3.0] weeks; 75 [48%] female) were included with paired examinations. Sensitivity and specificity were not found to be statistically different between the 2 SBFI systems. Human graders were effective with SBFI at detecting TR-ROP with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 83.49%. The AUCs with grader-assigned VSS only were 0.95 (95% CI,, 0.91-0.99) and 0.96 (95% CI,, 0.93-0.99) for RW-ROP and TR-ROP,, respectively. For the AI system,, the sensitivity of detecting TR-ROP sensitivity was 100% with specificity of 58.6%,, and RW-ROP sensitivity was 80.0% with specificity of 59.3%.
37166816#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE#In this cross-sectional study,, 2 different SBFI systems used by technicians in an ROP screening program were highly sensitive for TR-ROP. SBFI systems with AI may be a cost-effective method to improve the global capacity for ROP screening.

20560109#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The teleophthalmologic diagnosis achieves good results as compared to the ophthalmoscopic judgement in relation to retinopathy assessment criteria.
20560109#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The degree of retinal microangiopathy is important foran estimation of the vascular risk and for the optimisation of therapy in hypertensive and diabetic patients. Retinal microangiopathy may be determined by examination of the retinal fundus. We examined the reliability of the ophthalmoscopic diagnosis and of the telemedical judgement of fundus images in relation to the presence and the degree of retinopathy.
20560109#ABSTRACT#PATIENTS AND METHODS#This comparative observational study included 47 inpatient hypertensive and/or diabetic subjects. The fundus was judged ophthalmoscopically and subsequently,, a fundus image was generated by use of a KOWA camera. The images were sent to the Interdisciplinary Center of Ophthalmologic Preventive Medicine. The reliability of the two diagnostic methods was calculated for one of the two eyes,, which was selected by a random generator.
20560109#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The largest concordance of the two diagnosis methods was achieved,, in descending order,, for retinal bleeding,, stage of diabetic retinopathy and the papilla findings. Additionally,, there were no differences for the stage of hypertensive retinopathy und tortuosity. The reliability of arterio-venous nicking related to the right and the left eye was low or absent,, respectively.

34713034#ABSTRACT##Home-based rehabilitation after an acute episode or following an exacerbation of a chronic disease is often problematic with a clear lack of continuity of care between hospital and home care. Secondary prevention is an essential element of long-term rehabilitation where strategies oriented toward risk reduction,, treatment adherence,, and optimization of quality of life need to be applied. Frail and sometimes isolated,, the patient fails to adhere to the proposed post-discharge clinical pathway due to lack of appropriate clinical,, emotional,, and informational support. Providing a suitable rehabilitation after an acute episode or a chronic disease is a major issue,, as it helps people to live independently and enhance their quality of life. However,, as the rehabilitation period usually lasts some months,, the continuity of care is often interrupted in the transition from hospital to home. Virtual coaches could help these patients to engage in a personalized rehabilitation program that complies with age-related conditions. These coaches could be a key technology for empowering patients toward increasing their adherence to the care plan and to improve their secondary prevention measures. In this paper,, we are presenting a novel virtual coaching system that will address these challenges by combining recent technological advances with clinical pathways,, based on joint research and validation activities from researchers from the medical and information and communication technology (ICT) domains.

34238730#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#The deployment of telecytology (TC) requires a substantial investment of financial and human resources. To offset the high demand for rapid on-site evaluation,, we performed a limited deployment of dynamic TC and have detailed the workflow processes and the role of trainees.
34238730#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#TC systems were installed in radiology suites with a high volume of cases. Validation was performed using retrospective and prospective cases. Cytotechnologists and cytopathology fellows were the operators of the instrument. TC malignant and benign diagnoses were correlated with the final sign-out diagnoses.
34238730#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#TC can be deployed in a limited fashion as an option for cytopathologists to offset the high demand for rapid on-site evaluations. Trainee participation in TC service is important for building confidence and honing their cytology skills.

37020160#ABSTRACT##This paper examines the use of digital endpoints (DEs) derived from digital health technologies (DHTs),, focusing primarily on the specific considerations regarding the determination of meaningful change thresholds (MCT). Using DHTs in drug development is becoming more commonplace. There is general acceptance of the value of DHTs supporting patient-centric trial design,, capturing data outside the traditional clinical trial setting,, and generating DEs with the potential to be more sensitive to change than conventional assessments. However,, the transition from exploratory endpoints to primary and secondary endpoints capable of supporting labeling claims requires these endpoints to be substantive with reproducible population-specific values. Meaningful change represents the amount of change in an endpoint measure perceived as important to patients and should be determined for each digital endpoint and given population under consideration. This paper examines existing approaches to determine meaningful change thresholds and explores examples of these methodologies and their use as part of DE development: emphasizing the importance of determining what aspects of health are important to patients and ensuring the DE captures these concepts of interest and aligns with the overarching endpoint strategy. Examples are drawn from published DE qualification documentation and responses to qualification submissions under review by the various regulatory authorities. It is the hope that these insights will inform and strengthen the development and validation of DEs as drug development tools,, particularly for those new to the approaches to determine MCTs.

32339999#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parkinson disease monitoring is currently transitioning from periodic clinical assessments to continuous daily life monitoring in free-living conditions. Traditional Parkinson disease monitoring methods lack intraday fluctuation detection. Electronic diaries (eDiaries) hold the potential to collect subjective experiences on the severity and burden of motor and nonmotor symptoms in free-living conditions.
32339999#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to develop a Parkinson disease-specific eDiary based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and to explore its validation.
32339999#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An observational cohort of 20 patients with Parkinson disease used the smartphone-based EMA eDiary for 14 consecutive days without adjusting free-living routines. The eDiary app presented an identical questionnaire consisting of questions regarding affect,, context,, motor and nonmotor symptoms,, and motor performance 7 times daily at semirandomized moments. In addition,, patients were asked to complete a morning and an evening questionnaire.
32339999#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Mean affect correlated moderate-to-strong and moderate with motor performance (R=0.38 to 0.75; P<.001) and motor symptom (R=0.34 to 0.50; P<.001) items,, respectively. The motor performance showed a weak-to-moderate negative correlation with motor symptoms (R=-0.31 to -0.48; P<.001). Mean group answers given for on-medication conditions vs wearing-off-medication conditions differed significantly (P<.05); however,, not enough questionnaires were completed for the wearing-off-medication condition to reproduce these findings on individual levels.
32339999#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We presented a Parkinson disease-specific EMA eDiary. Correlations between given answers support the internal validity of the eDiary and underline EMA's potential in free-living Parkinson disease monitoring. Careful patient selection and EMA design adjustment to this targeted population and their fluctuations are necessary to generate robust proof of EMA validation in future work. Combining clinical Parkinson disease knowledge with practical EMA experience is inevitable to design and perform studies,, which will lead to the successful integration of eDiaries in free-living Parkinson disease monitoring.

33829684#ABSTRACT##In recent years,, with the progress of image processing and network transmission technology,, digital pathology (DP) is being more and more extensive applied in clinical practice,, and new artificial-intelligence-assisted diagnosis technology based on digital imaging is emerging. Being a widely-used mature field,, telepathology is changing the temporal and spatial scope of pathological diagnosis through remote electronic transmission of digital images. Fully digitized pathology departments are realizing the transformation of diagnostic modes and workflow from microscopic diagnosis to digital image computer review,, and there have already been successful examples of large-scale fully digitized pathology departments. However,, there are still many problems in the implementation of DP,, for example,, the quality stability and cost of the scanner,, the validation of the system,, the reengineering of the workflow,, the training of pathologists and the change of their perception of DP,, which all await further improvement. Although artificial intelligence diagnostic technology is showing great potential,, its application in pathological work is still limited to the field of auxiliary diagnostics,, and there is still a long way to go to the realization of comprehensive intelligent pathology. The rise of DP will bring about a profound change in the way of how pathological work is done and become a solid foundation for intelligent pathology.

34741893#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Healthcare providers have improved consumer access to healthcare services by the adoption of information communication technology and the use of telemedicine. With the current COVID-19 pandemic,, consumers are shifting to remote teleconsultation. There are several studies regarding consumers' acceptance and satisfaction with telemedicine among healthcare providers and a few among patients at healthcare facilities. However,, studies about patients' motivation toward the use of teleconsultation systems are very few.
34741893#ABSTRACT#AIM#The aim of this study was to validate an instrument of a newly developed framework to identify factors that motivate patients to use a teleconsultation system.

30295658#ABSTRACT##Different methods can be used in research to assess dietary intake,, many of which are still paper-based. Written estimated food diaries are often utilized in clinical trials,, despite being a burden for both study participants and researchers. This method requires participant literacy,, it is time consuming,, labor intensive,, and can easily lead to under-reporting. With advancements in technology,, there is a growing interest in electronic diaries that automate the dietary assessment process. These are focused on improving accuracy,, reducing both time and cost and providing users with a visual and more enjoyable experience. The methodology presented here aimed to validate the 'Boden Food Plate',, a novel web-based platform for self-recording of food and drink items,, compared to a traditional estimated food diary. The application was also rated on a satisfaction scale by study participants using a paper-based questionnaire. Sixty-seven participants completed the dietary measures on both the three-day electronic and paper food diaries. For the analysis,, only dietary data completed at both study time points (baseline and week six) was utilized. Despite small mean differences between dietary data collection methods,, Bland Altman analysis showed fairly wide 95% limits of agreement between the electronic platform and the written estimated food diary and there were few cases which did not fall within the 95% confidence intervals. Overall,, participants found the electronic food diary to be more fun than the paper method and as easy to use as hard copy diaries. The new platform has potential as a self-recording tool for the collection of dietary data,, particularly when utilized in clinical trial settings. However,, further validation studies are needed to improve the validity of this novel electronic dietary data collection tool.

28304241#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In the proposed scenario,, patient's eye images are obtained using a specified imaging modality,, and then sent to a server at the primary eye care centre (PECC) using ZigBee a short-range wireless network. It is linked to the main server at the base eye hospital (BEH) through a GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network. After diagnostic evaluation of the eye image using various automated diagnostic software,, data are sent to a physician in an urban center for further validation,, which is connected through GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX network. Performance evaluation of these wireless networks is carried out for their use in teleophthalmology application based on network parameters,, namely throughput,, average end-to-end delay,, and average jitter. It is found that end-to-end delay is the most critical network parameter affecting overall quality of service (QoS) of the proposed teleophthalmology network.
34741893#ABSTRACT#METHOD#This study used a modified eDelphi method incorporating content validity index and content validity ratio procedures to validate the instrument among fifteen experts from different disciplines. The eDelphi consisted of three rounds to review each item's relevance,, clarity,, importance and the overall validity of the instrument.
34741893#ABSTRACT#RESULT#The result showed a significant level of agreement among experts for individual items' relevance,, clarity and importance. For relevance,, all items had excellent I-CVI above 0.889,, except one item with I-CVI = 0.78,, which is still acceptable. For clarity,, all items had an excellent I-CVI > 0.889,, except one with I-CVI = 0.667. For importance,, most items had CVR above the threshold value of 0.778,, except 5 items. Also,, the result showed moderate to high content validity of the overall instrument (S-CVI/UA = 0.694; S-CVI/Ave = 0.996).
34741893#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#These findings support the validity and reliability of the developed instrument,, which can be used to identify factors that motivated patients to use a teleconsultation system. Future testing of the instrument should be conducted with a larger population that uses a teleconsultation system.
34741893#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#An instrument was developed to identify factors that motivated consumers to use teleconsultation,, using a modified eDelphi method among experts. The eDelphi method consisted of three rounds and the results showed that the instrument is a valid and reliable tool.

31579020#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Sport watches and fitness trackers provide a feasible way of obtaining energy expenditure (EE) estimations in daily life as well as during exercise. However,, today's popular wrist-worn technologies show only poor-to-moderate EE accuracy. Recently,, the invention of optical heart rate measurement and the further development of accelerometers in wrist units have opened up the possibility of measuring EE.
31579020#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to validate the new multisensory wristwatch Polar Vantage and its EE estimation in healthy individuals during low-to-high-intensity activities against indirect calorimetry.
31579020#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Overall,, 30 volunteers (15 females; mean age 29.5 [SD 5.1] years; mean height 1.7 [SD 0.8] m; mean weight 67.5 [SD 8.7] kg; mean maximal oxygen uptake 53.4 [SD 6.8] mL/min·kg) performed 7 activities-ranging in intensity from sitting to playing floorball-in a semistructured indoor environment for 10 min each,, with 2-min breaks in between. These activities were performed while wearing the Polar Vantage M wristwatch and the MetaMax 3B spirometer.
31579020#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After EE estimation,, a mean (SD) of 69.1 (42.7) kcal and 71.4 (37.8) kcal per 10-min activity were reported for the MetaMax 3B and the Polar Vantage,, respectively,, with a strong correlation of r=0.892 (P<.001). The systematic bias was 2.3 kcal (3.3%),, with 37.8 kcal limits of agreement. The lowest mean absolute percentage errors were reported during the sitting and reading activities (9.1%),, and the highest error rates during household chores (31.4%). On average,, 59.5% of the mean EE values obtained by the Polar Vantage were within ±20% of accuracy when compared with the MetaMax 3B. The activity intensity quantified by perceived exertion (odds ratio [OR] 2.028; P<.001) and wrist circumference (OR -1.533; P=.03) predicted 29% of the error rates within the Polar Vantage.
31579020#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Polar Vantage has a statistically moderate-to-good accuracy in EE estimation that is activity dependent. During sitting and reading activities,, the EE estimation is very good,, whereas during nonsteady activities that require wrist and arm movement,, the EE accuracy is only moderate. However,, compared with other available wrist-worn EE monitors,, the Polar Vantage can be recommended,, as it performs among the best.

32874041#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#This study compares a web-based teleophthalmology assessment with a clinical slit lamp examination to screen for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) among diabetic patients in a rural East African district.
32874041#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Six hundred and twelve eyes from 306 diabetic patients underwent both a clinical slit lamp examination and a teleretina (TR) assessment by an experienced ophthalmologist. Both assessments were compared for any DR and AMD using the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study and age-related eye disease study grading scales,, respectively.
32874041#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 612 TR assessment photos,, 74 (12%) were deemed ungradable due to media opacities,, poor patient cooperation,, or unsatisfactory photographs. The ability to detect DR and AMD showed a fair agreement (kappa statistic 0.27 and 0.23,, respectively) between the TR and clinical slit lamp examination. Relative to a clinical slit lamp evaluation,, a positive TR diagnosis carried a 75.0% positive predictive value when diagnosing DR and a 27.3% positive predictive value when diagnosing AMD. A negative TR diagnosis carried a 97.2% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of DR and a 98.1% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AMD.
32874041#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#When comparing TR assessments to clinical slit lamp examinations to diagnose DR and AMD,, there was a fair agreement. Although further validation is needed,, the TR approach provides a promising method to diagnose DR and AMD,, two major causes of ocular impairment worldwide.

31834891#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Sub-Saharan Africa lags in adoption of mobile health (m-health) applications and in leveraging m-health for sustainable development goals. There is a need for a comprehensive investigation of determinants of hospitals' adoption of m-health in Sub-Saharan Africa to inform policies,, practices and investments.
31834891#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This investigation used a logit regression model to analyze the determinants of m-health adoption in Kenyan hospitals applying the Technological,, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory. A representative sample of 211 executives of Level 4-6 hospitals in 24 counties provided primary data on Patient-Centered (PC) and Facility-Centered (FC) m-health applications.

31834891#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both PC and FC m-health adoption were predicted by competition for patients (PC p = 0.041,, FC p = 0.021),, IT human resource capacity (PC p = 0.048,, FC p = 0.037),, and hospital pursuit of market growth through technological leadership (PC p = 0.010,, FC p = 0.020). Further determinants of PC m-health adoption included hospital access to slack financial resources (p = 0.006),, acquisition strategy (p = 0.011),, compatibility with the hospital systems (p = 0.015),, trialability (p = 0.019),, medical insurance company support (p = 0.025),,patient pressure (p = 0.036),, and perceived effect of global medical tourism (p = 0.039). FC m-health adoption was predicted by hospital size (p = 0.008),, ICT infrastructure capacity (p = 0.041),, and government support (p = 0.013).
31834891#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A differentiated approach is required to scale up m-health adoption. PC m-health requires emphasis on establishing national and regional compatibility and interoperability,, developing trialability processes and validation mechanisms,, incentivizing patient competition and mobility,, establishing innovative and cost-effective acquisition strategies,, and ensuring integration of digital services within national insurance schemes and policies. These policies require support from patients and communities to drive demand and spur investment in adequate IT human resources to maintain reliability. Pilot PC m-health projects should prioritize hospitals with slack financial resources,, while FC m-health should target large facility size. FC m-health applications are more complex and costly than PC,, requiring government incentives to trigger hospital investments and national investment in ICT infrastructure. Investors and hospital managers should integrate m-health into market growth strategies for sustainable m-health scale-up in Kenya and beyond.

33924024#ABSTRACT##Healthcare is now an important part of daily life because of rising consciousness of health management. Medical professionals can know users' health condition if they are able to access information immediately. Telemedicine systems,, which provides long distance medical communication and services,, is a multi-functional remote medical service that can help patients in bed in long-distance communication environments. As telemedicine systems work in public networks,, privacy preservation issue of sensitive and private transmitted information is important. One of the means of proving a user's identity are user-controlled single sign-on (UCSSO) authentication scheme,, which can establish a secure communication channel using authenticated session keys between the users and servers of telemedicine systems,, without threats of eavesdropping,, impersonation,, etc.,, and allow patients access to multiple telemedicine services with a pair of identity and password. In this paper,, we proposed a smartcard-based user-controlled single sign-on (SC-UCSSO) for telemedicine systems that not only remains above merits but achieves privacy preservation and enhances security and performance compared to previous schemes that were proved with BAN logic and automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA).

35421974#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Improvements to the primary prevention of physical health illnesses like diabetes in the general population have not been mirrored to the same extent in people with serious mental illness (SMI). This work evaluates the technical feasibility of implementing an electronic clinical decision support system (eCDSS) for supporting the management of dysglycaemia and diabetes in patients with serious mental illness in a secondary mental healthcare setting.
35421974#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A stepwise approach was taken as an overarching and guiding framework for this work. Participatory methods were employed to design and deploy a monitoring and alerting eCDSS. The eCDSS was evaluated for its technical feasibility. The initial part of the feasibility evaluation was conducted in an outpatient community mental health team. Thereafter,, the evaluation of the eCDSS progressed to a more in-depth in silico validation.
35421974#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A digital health intervention that enables monitoring and alerting of at-risk patients based on an approved diabetes management guideline was developed. The eCDSS generated alerts according to expected standards and in line with clinical guideline recommendations.
35421974#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#It is feasible to design and deploy a functional monitoring and alerting eCDSS in secondary mental healthcare. Further work is required in order to fully evaluate the integration of the eCDSS into routine clinical workflows. By describing and sharing the steps that were and will be taken from concept to clinical testing,, useful insights could be provided to teams that are interested in building similar digital health interventions.

36520566#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To provide a practical guide for the implementation and use of  Pharmaceutical Care through Telepharmacy by healthcare professionals and  patients in its different scopes of application. To establish a definition of  Telepharmacy and describe the technological tools necessary,, advantages,, and  keys to facilitating its implementation.
36520566#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Between December 2020 and January 2021,, the Board of Directors of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy,, along with the coordinators of the  project "Outpatient Care Strategies" ("Mapa Estratégico para la Atención al  Paciente Externo") designed a strategy to foster the development and  expansion of Telepharmacy in Spain. This strategy involved four courses of  action. To develop the first course of action,, a call was made in March 2021  among the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy members to develop seven  methodological guidelines. The purpose of these documents was to meet the  needs for the implementation of Telepharmacy,, the most relevant being the  development of specific guides for professionals and patients. The guides were  developed in four stages between May and October 2021,, including a literature review; consensus-based interviews,, online workshops,, and,, finally,, the  drafting and validation of the final documents. Once the final draft was  prepared,, a public evaluation of suggestions and observations was performed  for a month. The documents were also presented to the Patient Committee of  the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy.
36520566#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Guide for Professionals provides guidelines for the development and implementation of Telepharmacy in its different scopes of  application. These guides provide a description of specific goals,, healthcare benefits,, tools required,, and keys to the implementation of  Telepharmacy. The Guide for Patients is complementary to face-to-face  pharmaceutical care from the point of view of the patient,, with special  emphasis being placed on the most frequently used tools,, the potential  benefits,, and the keys to facilitating patients' understanding of the purpose  and use of Telepharmacy.
36520566#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A Practical Guide for Professionals and Patients was developed to ensure the standard development,, implementation,, and spread of Telepharmacy in all its scopes. This guide is intended to help Hospital Pharmacy professionals benefit from Telepharmacy as a  complementary tool to face-to-face pharmaceutical care.

28508815#ABSTRACT##Based on recent telemonitoring activities in Austria for enabling integrated health care,, the communication interfaces between personal health devices (e.g. blood pressure monitor) and personal health gateway devices (e.g. smartphone,, routing received information to wide area networks) play an important role. In order to ease testing of the Bluetooth Low Energy interface functionality of the personal health gateway devices,, a personal health device simulator was developed. Based on specifications from the Bluetooth SIG a XML software test configuration file structure is defined that declares the specific features of the personal health devices simulated. Using this configuration file,, different scenarios are defined,, e.g. send a single measurement result from a blood pressure reading or sending multiple (historic) weight scale readings. The simulator is intended to be used for educational purposes in lectures,, where the number of physical personal health devices can be reduced and learning can be improved. It could be shown that this simulator assists the development process of mHealth applications by reducing the time needed for development and testing.

31719106#ABSTRACT##Digital pathology including whole slide image (WSI) acquisition is a promising tool for histopathologic teleconsultation. To test and validate the use of WSI in comparison with robotic microscopy for intraoperative frozen section consultation of peripheral hospitals serviced by our department,, we compared the VENTANA DP 200 slide scanner with an established remote-controlled digital microscope. Thirty cases were retrospectively analysed. In comparison with a median specimen handling time of 19?min using remote-controlled microscopy,, the WSI handling was significantly shorter (11?min,, p=0.0089) and offered better image quality,, for example,, allowing to detect a positive resection margin by a malignant melanoma that had been missed using the former system. Prospectively assessed on 12 cases,, the median handling time was 6?min. Here,, we demonstrate the applicability and the advantages of WSI for intraoperative frozen section teleconsultation. WSI-based telepathology prooves to be an efficient and reliable tool providing superior turn-around time and image resolution.
32370129#ABSTRACT##In a pandemic situation such as that we are living at the time of writing of this paper due to the Covid-19 virus,, the need of tele-healthcare service becomes dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients,, thence reducing the risk of infection. Leveraging the recent Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies,, this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service where clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices and results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation. In particular,, we discuss a distributed scenario where nurses,, technicians and medical doctors belonging to different hospitals cooperate through their federated hospital Clouds to form a virtual health team able to carry out a healthcare workflow in secure fashion leveraging the intrinsic security features of the Blockchain technology. In particular,, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform.

32716310#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is an anti-tumor necrosis factor drug approved for the treatment of multiple moderate to severe chronic inflammatory diseases. In the European Union,, CZP is approved for administration by subcutaneous self-injection using a prefilled syringe,, prefilled pen,, or reusable electromechanical auto-injector (electronic device). CimplyMe is a companion app for use alongside CZP self-injection devices,, designed to support CZP-treated patients self-managing their treatment and disease.
32716310#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to validate the usability of the companion app by demonstrating that tasks required for use can be performed successfully by intended end users.

32716310#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We recruited 15 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis,, currently prescribed biologic treatment,, and using apps on a smart phone. Patients were assessed on their ability to use the companion app in a setting designed to simulate a location where patients regularly administer biologic treatment. To assess the usability of the key features of the app,, 8 critical and 3 noncritical tasks were designed. Patients' success on each task was recorded through observations or knowledge-based questions. Successes with difficulty and use errors were also recorded. If a patient made a use error at the first attempt,, a second attempt was allowed. Second-attempt use errors were recorded as a task failure.
32716310#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 207 first attempts at the 14 components of the 8 critical tasks were evaluated (3 patients failed to complete one component); 178 (86.0%) critical tasks were successfully completed at the first attempt. The remaining first attempts comprised 16 (7.7%) successes with difficulty and 13 (6.3%) use errors,, which had to be repeated. One critical task was not re-attempted by one patient due to time constraints; however,, there were no use errors in the 12 completed second attempts. A total of 107 first attempts at the 3 noncritical tasks were made,, all of which (107/107,, 100.0%) were completed without use errors.
32716310#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In simulated testing,, patients were able to successfully use the companion app without formal training. This study suggests the companion app is easy to use and could help patients prescribed CZP better manage their treatment and disease.

32046567#ABSTRACT##Digitalized healthcare services offer remote and cost-effective treatment of diabetes patients. Thus,, the present online study analyzed the readiness to use telemonitoring among Austrian diabetes patients. We developed and validated a German version of the patient telehealth readiness assessment tool and performed quantitative context analysis of free-text comments on perceived barriers and benefits of telemonitoring. Participants (n?=?41,, 42.6% females) achieved a medium average readiness level for telemonitoring. The three top benefits were intensified care,, shorter travel and waiting times,, and better therapy adjustment. The top three barriers were data privacy issues,, loss of personal communication and focus on blood sugar,, and teledoctor competence. Diabetes patients represent a suitable target group for remote treatment opportunities. However,, a shift from traditional face-to-face medical care to exclusive telemonitoring treatment from diagnosis to consultation and treatment requires fundamental new legal framework conditions.

24334198#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Interview participants found the trial design,, including online recruitment via Facebook,, online registration,, email communication with the researchers,, and online completion of sexual health questionnaires to be highly acceptable and preferable to traditional methods. Incentives might assist in recruiting those who would not otherwise participate. Participants generally enjoyed taking part in sexual health research online and found the questionnaire itself thought-provoking. Completing the sexual health questionnaires online encouraged honesty in responding that might not be achieved with other methods. The majority of interview participants also thought that receiving and returning a urine sample for chlamydia testing via post was acceptable.
24334198#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These findings provide strong support for the use of online research methods for sexual health research,, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and execution of all trial procedures including recruitment,, respondent validation,, trial related communication,, and methods to maximize follow-up. Our findings suggest that sexual health outcome measurement might encourage reflection on current behavior,, sometimes leading to behavior change.

24334198#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young people in the United Kingdom is increasing. The Internet can be a suitable medium for delivery of sexual health information and sexual health promotion,, given its high usage among young people,, its potential for creating a sense of anonymity,, and ease of access. Online randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly being used to evaluate online interventions,, but while there are many advantages to online methodologies,, they can be associated with a number of problems,, including poor engagement with online interventions,, poor trial retention,, and concerns about the validity of data collected through self-report online. We conducted an online feasibility trial that tested the effects of the Sexunzipped website for sexual health compared to an information-only website. This study reports on a qualitative evaluation of the trial procedures,, describing participants' experiences and views of the Sexunzipped online trial including methods of recruitment,, incentives,, methods of contact,, and sexual health outcome measurement.
24334198#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our goal was to determine participants' views of the acceptability and validity of the online trial methodology used in the pilot RCT of the Sexunzipped intervention.
24334198#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used three qualitative data sources to assess the acceptability and validity of the online pilot RCT methodology: (1) individual interviews with 22 participants from the pilot RCT,, (2) 133 emails received by the trial coordinator from trial participants,, and (3) 217 free-text comments from the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An iterative,, thematic analysis of all three data sources was conducted to identify common themes related to the acceptability and feasibility of the online trial methodology.

25232910#ABSTRACT##The deployment of the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm requires designing and integrating user-centered smart environments to assist people in their daily life activities. This research paper details an integration and validation of multiple heterogeneous sensors with hybrid reasoners that support decision making in order to monitor personal and environmental data at a smart home in a private way. The results innovate on knowledge-based platforms,, distributed sensors,, connected objects,, accessibility and authentication methods to promote independent living for elderly people. TALISMAN+,, the AmI framework deployed,, integrates four subsystems in the smart home: (i) a mobile biomedical telemonitoring platform to provide elderly patients with continuous disease management; (ii) an integration middleware that allows context capture from heterogeneous sensors to program environment's reaction; (iii) a vision system for intelligent monitoring of daily activities in the home; and (iv) an ontologies-based integrated reasoning platform to trigger local actions and manage private information in the smart home. The framework was integrated in two real running environments,, the UPM Accessible Digital Home and MetalTIC house,, and successfully validated by five experts in home care,, elderly people and personal autonomy.

15747940#ABSTRACT##The objective of the e-Vital project is the validation of the market concerning the provision of a novel remote telemedicine service aimed at large sensitive parts of the European population,, the "at-risk" citizens,, who are usually patients with a stable medical condition that allow a near normal life but may suddenly deteriorate and put life at risk. This service will increase their quality of life and their feeling of safety concerning their health. The e-Vital project focuses on the implementation and exploitation of a modular and ambulatory secure telemedicine platform,, which is using easily wearable vital signs monitoring devices,, causing minimal discomfort to patients,, and which transfer in real time and on-line critical vital parameters to doctors and/or medical experts/consultants,, regardless of their location,, while getting feedback to increase their feeling of comfort or in case of alarm.

10505969#ABSTRACT##Investigation on the applicability of low-cost videoconferencing (VC) for health care services is becoming a real need. Reduced resources drive the administrators to evaluate inexpensive solutions for telemedicine. Considering this scenario,, this work is a preliminary step to validate,, from a technical point of view,, if low-cost VC systems could be suitable for orthopaedic teleconsulting services. For this purpose,, four different videoconferencing systems were tested. Each VC system was composed of a computer and a VC device installed in. VC devices were chosen among the most popular and distributed products (made by Intel,, PictureTel and Aethra). The Telemedicine Benchmark,, a specific tool defined by the authors,, was applied to measure the overall systems performances in terms of time delays during basic rate ISDN connections (128 Kbit/s). Results showed that it is possible to apply low-cost videoconferencing systems for orthopaedic teleconsulting services. Most of the systems provided acceptable performance for medical image visualization and real time joint working. Further developments are recommendable to enhance the VC software tools capabilities and to improve software-user interface. reserved.

33190010#ABSTRACT##Conventional one-layer models have yet to achieve clinically relevant classification rates in predicting exacerbations for patients with COPD. The present study investigates whether a two-layer probabilistic model can increase classification rates compared to a one-layer model. Continuous measurements of oxygen saturation,, pulse rate,, and blood pressure from nine patients with COPD were structured into 17 prodromal exacerbation periods and 398 control periods. A one-layer model was compared to a two-layer model based on prior probabilities using double cross-validation. The two models were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and sensitivity at an arbitrarily set specificity of 0.95. This comparison was carried out across nine different classification algorithms. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was increased across all nine classification algorithms and by a mean value of 0.11. Sensitivity at an arbitrarily set specificity of 0.95 was also increased by a mean value of 0.13. In conclusion,, a two-layer probabilistic model for predicting COPD exacerbations can increase classification rates compared to a one-layer model,, and to a level of clinical relevance,, for patients in telehealth.

32866314#ABSTRACT##The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has shifted how many patients receive outpatient care. Telehealth and remote monitoring have become more prevalent,, and measurements taken in a patient's home using biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) offer convenient opportunities to collect vital sign data. Healthcare providers may lack prior experience using BioMeTs in remote patient care,, and,, therefore,, may be unfamiliar with the many versions of BioMeTs,, novel data collection protocols,, and context of the values collected. To make informed patient care decisions based on the biometric data collected remotely,, it is important to understand the engineering solutions embedded in the products,, data collection protocols,, form factors (physical size and shape),, data quality considerations,, and availability of validation information. This article provides an overview of BioMeTs available for collecting vital signs (temperature,, heart rate,, blood pressure,, oxygen saturation,, and respiratory rate) and discusses the strengths and limitations of continuous monitoring. We provide considerations for remote data collection and sources of validation information to guide BioMeT use in the era of COVID-19 and beyond.
35102464#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Patient activation comprises the skills,, knowledge and motivation necessary for patients' effective contribution to their care. We adapted and validated the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) in the?=?40 years old Hungarian general population.
35102464#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional web survey was conducted among 900 respondents selected from an online panel via quota sampling. After 10 days,, the survey was repeated on 100 respondents. The distribution,, internal consistency,, test-retest reliability,, factor structure,, convergent,, discriminant and known-groups validity of PAM-13 were assessed according to the COSMIN guidelines.
35102464#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The sample comprised 779 respondents. Mean (±?SD) age was 60.4?±?10.6 years,, 54% were female and 67% had chronic illness. Mean (±?SD) PAM-13 score was 60.6?±?10.0. We found good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.77),, moderate test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.62; n?=?75),, a single-factor structure and good content validity: PAM-13 showed moderate correlation with the eHealth Literacy Scale (r?=?0.40),, and no correlation with age (r?=?0.02),, education (r?=?0.04) or income (??=?0.04). Higher PAM-13 scores were associated with fewer lifestyle risks (p?<?0.001),, more frequent health information seeking (p?<?0.001),, participation in patient education (p?=?0.018) and various online health-related behaviours. When controlling for health literacy,, sociodemographic factors and health status,, the association of higher PAM-13 scores with overall fewer lifestyle risks,, normal body mass index,, physical activity and adequate diet remained significant. Similar properties were observed in the subgroup of participants with chronic morbidity,, but not in the age group 65+.
35102464#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#PAM-13 demonstrated good validity in the general population. Its properties in clinical populations and the elderly as well as responsiveness to interventions warrant further research.

27896984#ABSTRACT##In our recent Asthma Mobile Health Study (AMHS),, thousands of asthma patients across the country contributed medical data through the iPhone Asthma Health App on a daily basis for an extended period of time. The collected data included daily self-reported asthma symptoms,, symptom triggers,, and real time geographic location information. The AMHS is just one of many studies occurring in the context of now many thousands of mobile health apps aimed at improving wellness and better managing chronic disease conditions,, leveraging the passive and active collection of data from mobile,, handheld smart devices. The ability to identify patient groups or patterns of symptoms that might predict adverse outcomes such as asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations from these types of large,, prospectively collected data sets,, would be of significant general interest. However,, conventional clustering methods cannot be applied to these types of longitudinally collected data,, especially survey data actively collected from app users,, given heterogeneous patterns of missing values due to: 1) varying survey response rates among different users,, 2) varying survey response rates over time of each user,, and 3) non-overlapping periods of enrollment among different users. To handle such complicated missing data structure,, we proposed a probability imputation model to infer missing data. We also employed a consensus clustering strategy in tandem with the multiple imputation procedure. Through simulation studies under a range of scenarios reflecting real data conditions,, we identified favorable performance of the proposed method over other strategies that impute the missing value through low-rank matrix completion. When applying the proposed new method to study asthma triggers and symptoms collected as part of the AMHS,, we identified several patient groups with distinct phenotype patterns. Further validation of the methods described in this paper might be used to identify clinically important patterns in large data sets with complicated missing data structure,, improving the ability to use such data sets to identify at-risk populations for potential intervention.

15885325#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There was a significant correlation (p<0.01) between image quality and age of the subject. There were significant agreements for the clinically important observations of otorrhea,, perforation,, retracted tympanic membrane and atrophy of the tympanic membrane (p<0.05). There were significant agreements for the diagnoses of acute otitis media,, chronic suppurative otitis media,, otitis media with effusion and Eustachian tube dysfunction. The rate of recommendations for review or referral after a tele-otology assessment were between 4 and 16% higher than those in made in the field. The agreements between the various forms of advice or recommendations made in the field to those made by tele-otology were statistically significant (p<0.01).
15885325#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A tele-otology system that incorporates good quality digitised images of the tympanic membrane,, audiological and tympanometric data,, and a comprehensive clinical history provides the ear specialist with sufficient information to make a confident diagnose of existing middle ear disease,, and provide management advice to the patients' primary care provider.

31237570#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Energy balance is defined as the difference between energy expenditure and energy intake. The current state of knowledge supports the need to better integrate mechanistic approaches through effective studies of energy balance in the cancer population because of an observed significant lack of adherence to healthy lifestyle recommendations. To stimulate changes in breast cancer survivors' lifestyles based on energy balance,, our group developed the BENECA (Energy Balance on Cancer) mHealth app. BENECA has been previously validated as a reliable energy balance monitoring system.
31237570#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Based on our previous results,, the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of BENECA mHealth in an ecological clinical setting with breast cancer survivors,, by studying (1) its feasibility and (2) pretest-posttest differences with regard to breast cancer survivor lifestyles,, quality of life (QoL),, and physical activity (PA) motivation.

31237570#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Eighty breast cancer survivors diagnosed with stage I to IIIA and with a body mass index over 25 kg/m2 were enrolled in this prospective test-retest quasi-experimental study. Patients used BENECA mHealth for 8 weeks and were assessed at baseline and the postintervention period. Feasibility main outcomes included percentage of adoption,, usage,, and attrition; user app quality perception measured with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS); satisfaction with the Net Promoter Score (NPS); and barriers and facilitators of its use. Clinical main outcomes included measuring QoL with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 (EORT QLQ-C30),, PA assessment with accelerometry,, PA motivation measure with a Spanish self-efficacy scale for physical activity (EAF),, and body composition with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Statistical tests (using paired-sample t tests) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed.
31237570#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#BENECA was considered feasible by the breast cancer survivors in terms of use (76%,, 58/76),, adoption (69%,, 80/116),, and satisfaction (positive NPS). The app quality score did not make it one of the best-rated apps (mean 3.71,, SD 0.47 points out of 5). BENECA mHealth improved the QoL of participants (global health mean difference [MD] 12.83,, 95% CI 8.95-16.71,, P<.001),, and EAF score (global MD 36.99,, 95% CI 25.52-48.46,, P<.001),, daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MD 7.38,, 95% CI 0.39-14.37,, P=.04),, and reduced body weight (MD -1.42,, 95% CI -1.97 to -0.87,, P<.001).
31237570#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#BENECA mHealth can be considered feasible in a real clinical context to promote behavioral changes in the lifestyles of breast cancer survivors,, but it needs to be enhanced to improve user satisfaction with use and functionality. This study highlights the importance of the use of mobile apps based on energy balance and how the QoL of breast cancer survivors can be improved via monitoring.

23891239#ABSTRACT##When designing a complete system of daily-telerehabilitation it should be borne in mind that properly designed methodologies should be furnished for patients to execute specific motion tasks and for care givers to assess the relevant parameters. Whether in hospital or at home,, the system should feature two basic elements: (a) instrumented and walking aids or supports,, (b) equipment for the assessment of parameters. Being gait the focus,, the idea was to design,, construct and validate - as an alternative to the complex and expensive instruments currently used - a simple,, portable kit that may be easily interfaced/integrated with the most common mechanical tools used in motion rehabilitation (instrumented walkways,, aids,, supports),, with feedback to both patient for self-monitoring and trainer/therapist (present or remote) for clinical reporting. The proposed system consists of: one step-counter,, three couples of photo-emitter detectors,, one central unit for collecting and processing the telemetrically transmitted data; a software interface on a dedicated PC and a network adapter. The system has been successfully validated in a clinical application on two groups of 16 subjects at the 1st and 2nd level of the Tinetti test. The degree of acceptance by subjects and care-givers was high. The system was also successfully compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit,, a de facto standard. The portable kit can be used with different rehabilitation tools and different ground rugosity. The advantages are: (a) very low costs when compared with optoelectronic solutions and other portable solutions; (b) very high accuracy,, also for subjects with imbalance problems; (c) good compatibility with any rehabilitative tool.
22903004#ABSTRACT##The use of telehealth paradigms for the remote management of patients suffering from chronic conditions has become more commonplace with the advancement of Internet connectivity and enterprise software systems. To facilitate clinicians in managing large numbers of telehealth patients,, and in digesting the vast array of data returned from the remote monitoring environment,, decision support systems in various guises are often utilized. The success of decision support systems in interpreting patient conditions from physiological data is dependent largely on the quality of these recorded data. This paper outlines an algorithm to determine the quality of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings obtained from telehealth patients. Three hundred short ECG recordings were manually annotated to identify movement artifact,, QRS locations and signal quality (discrete quality levels) by a panel of three experts,, who then reconciled the annotation as a group to resolve any discrepancies. After applying a published algorithm to remove gross movement artifact,, the proposed method was then applied to estimate the remaining ECG signal quality,, using a Parzen window supervised statistical classifier model. The three-class classifier model,, using a number of time-domain features and evaluated using cross validation,, gave an accuracy in classifying signal quality of 78.7% (? = 0.67) when using fully automated preprocessing algorithms to remove gross motion artifact and detect QRS locations. This is a similar level of accuracy to the reported human inter-scorer agreement when generating the gold standard annotation (accuracy = 70-89.3%,, ? = 0.54-0.84). These results indicate that the assessment of the quality of single-lead ECG recordings,, acquired in unsupervised telehealth environments,, is entirely feasible and may help to promote the acceptance and utility of future decision support systems for remotely managing chronic disease conditions.

25686308#ABSTRACT##Since the knee joint bears the full weight load of the human body and the highest pressure loads while providing flexible movement,, it is the body part most vulnerable and susceptible to osteoarthritis. In exercise therapy,, the early rehabilitation stages last for approximately six weeks,, during which the patient works with the physical therapist several times each week. The patient is afterwards given instructions for continuing rehabilitation exercise by him/herself at home. This study develops a rehabilitation exercise assessment mechanism using three wearable sensors mounted on the chest,, thigh and shank of the working leg in order to enable the patients with knee osteoarthritis to manage their own rehabilitation progress. In this work,, time-domain,, frequency-domain features and angle information of the motion sensor signals are used to classify the exercise type and identify whether their postures are proper or not. Three types of rehabilitation exercise commonly prescribed to knee osteoarthritis patients are: Short-Arc Exercise,, Straight Leg Raise,, and Quadriceps Strengthening Mini-squats. After ten subjects performed the three kinds of rehabilitation activities,, three validation techniques including 10-fold cross-validation,, within subject cross validation,, and leave-one-subject cross validation are utilized to confirm the proposed mechanism. The overall recognition accuracy for exercise type classification is 97.29% and for exercise posture identification it is 88.26%. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed mechanism which can help patients perform rehabilitation movements and progress effectively. Moreover,, the proposed mechanism is able to detect multiple errors at once,, fulfilling the requirements for rehabilitation assessment.

36689545#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data were from a cross-sectional,, national probability survey deployed in 3 cross-sectional stages several weeks apart to adult residents of the United States (N=6475; stage 1 n=2190,, 33.82%; stage 2 n=2238,, 34.56%; and stage 3 n=2047,, 31.62%) from the AmeriSpeak probability-based research panel covering approximately 97% of the US household population. Five items asked about the willingness to use mHealth tools for COVID-19-related screening and tracking and provide biological specimens for COVID-19 testing.
36689545#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings showed that the screener is psychometrically valid. It can also be adapted to future public health crises. Racial and ethnic minority adults showed a greater willingness to use mHealth tools than White adults. Rural adults showed more mHealth willingness than suburban and urban adults. Findings have implications for public health screening and tracking and understanding digital health inequities,, including lack of uptake.

33830794#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of digital health or e-health is growing. The potential positive impact on IBD care from supported self-management using these tools emerged from a literature review carried out in preparation for a service improvement project. A patient-reported outcomes measure (PROM) with validation across IBD sub-types was already available for use. This internationally recognised tool has potential for use with existing or new e-health systems.
33830794#ABSTRACT#AIMS#In order to test the concept of using PROMs to support practice and follow up a small-scale pilot study was designed. The aim of the study was to understand if empowering patients to undertake supported self-management could lead in turn to improved flow through outpatient services.
33830794#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An audit was carried out of PROMs looking at quality of life (QoL) as well as disease activity using an electronic platform in real time at the point of patient contact. The disease activity indices used were the Harvey Bradshaw Index and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index,, due to the author's familiarity with these tools.
33830794#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 15 participants,, 10 reported themselves as 'well' or 'well with questions' all participants reported an acceptance of supported remote self-management using e-health.
33830794#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This evaluation led to PROMs being captured on a tablet in the outpatient setting in the pre-pandemic period. Allowing patients to use the PROM as a tool in the outpatient setting has led to longitudinal data being added to the e-health system for each individual. Well patients could be managed remotely,, freeing capacity in outpatient clinics.

36689545#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the first,, exploratory sample,, 3 of 5 items loaded onto 1 underlying factor,, the willingness to use pandemic-related mHealth tools,, based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA). A 2-factor solution,, including the 3-item factor,, fit the data (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.038,, comparative fit index [CFI]=1.000,, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR]=0.005),, and the factor loadings for the 3 items ranged from 0.849 to 0.893. In the second,, validation sample,, the reliability of the 3-item measure was high (Cronbach a=.90),, and 1 underlying factor for the 3 items was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA): RMSEA=0,, CFI=1.000,, SRMR=0 (a saturated model); factor loadings ranged from 1.000 to 0.962. The factor was independently associated with COVID-19-preventive behaviors (eg,, "worn a face mask": r=0.313,, SE=0.041,, P<.001; "kept a 6-foot distance from those outside my household": r=0.282,, SE=0.050,, P<.001) and the willingness to provide biological specimens for COVID-19 testing (ie,, swab to cheek or nose: r=0.709,, SE=0.017,, P<.001; small blood draw: r=0.684,, SE=0.019,, P<.001). In the third,, multiple-group sample,, the measure was invariant,, or measured the same thing in the same way (ie,, difference in CFI [?CFI]<0.010 across all grouping categories),, across age groups,, gender,, racial/ethnic groups,, education levels,, US geographic region,, and population density (ie,, rural,, suburban,, urban). When repeated across different samples,, factor-analytic findings were essentially the same. Additionally,, there were mean differences (?M) in the willingness to use mHealth tools across samples,, mainly based on race or ethnicity and population density. For example,, in SD units,, suburban (?M=-0.30,, SE=0.13,, P=.001) and urban (?M=-0.42,, SE=0.12,, P<.001) adults showed less willingness to use mHealth tools than rural adults in the third sample collected on May 30-June 8,, 2020,, but no differences were detected in the first sample collected on April 20-26,, 2020.

26388346#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#One of the scales most used to measure quickly and easily eHealth Literacy is the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS); however,, there was no validation of this scale in Spanish. Therefore,, the aim of this study was to adapt and validate the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) to the Spanish context.
26388346#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Spanish translation of the scale eHEALS was administered along with other scales to measure some indicators of psychological well-being (self-esteem,, subjective vitality and life satisfaction). A sample of 447 university students aged between 18 and 45 years was selected. An exploratory factor analysis,, confirmatory factor analysis,, analysis of invariance,, reliability,, temporal stability and bivariate correlations were performed.
26388346#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Exploratory factor analysis revealed a monofactorial structure that explained 52.55% of variance,, with high factor loadings of the items. Reliability of 0.87 and test-retest correlation of 0.78 was obtained. The confirmatory factor analysis showed appropriate adjustments indices: ?2=66.60; p=0.00; ?2/ df=4.44; comparative fit index=0.97; incremental fit index=0.97; tucker lewis index=0.94; root mean square of approximattion =0.08; standardized root mean square residual=0.05. The questionnaire was invariant by gender. Regarding the criterion validity,, a statistically significant and positive correlations between 0.12 and 0.16 with three indicators of psychological wellbeing was obtained (self-esteem,, subjective vitality and life satisfaction).
26388346#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The spanish version of the eHEALS tested in this work has shown to be a valid and reliable scale to measure eHealth competence in university students.

31066712#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The continuous development of mobile apps has led to many health care professionals using them in clinical settings; however,, little research is available to guide occupational therapists (OTs) in choosing quality apps for use in their respective clinical settings.
31066712#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study was to use the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS) to evaluate the quality of the most frequently noted mobile health (mHealth) apps used by OTs and to demonstrate the utility of the uMARS to assess the quality of mHealth apps.
31066712#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A previous study surveying OTs' use of apps in therapy compiled a list of apps frequently noted. A total of 25 of these apps were evaluated individually by 2 trained researchers using the uMARS,, a simple,, multidimensional analysis tool that can be reliably used to evaluate the quality of mHealth apps.
31066712#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The top 10 apps had a total quality score of 4.3,, or higher,, out of 5 based on the mean scores of engagement,, functionality,, and aesthetics. Apps scored highest in functionality and lowest in engagement. Apps noted most frequently were not always high-quality apps; apps noted least frequently were not always low-quality apps.
31066712#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Determining the effectiveness of using apps in clinical settings must be built upon a foundation of the implementation of high-quality apps. Mobile apps should not be incorporated into clinical settings solely based on frequency of use. The uMARS should be considered as a useful tool for OTs,, and other professionals,, to determine app quality.

30501638#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health-related apps have great potential to enhance health and prevent disease globally,, but their quality currently varies too much for clinicians to feel confident about recommending them to patients. The major quality concerns are dubious app content,, loss of privacy associated with widespread sharing of the patient data they capture,, inaccurate advice or risk estimates and the paucity of impact studies. This may explain why current evidence about app use by people with health-related conditions is scanty and inconsistent.
30501638#ABSTRACT#MAIN TEXT#There are many concerns about health-related apps designed for use by patients,, such as poor regulation and implicit trust in technology. However,, there are several actions that various stakeholders,, including users,, developers,, health professionals and app distributors,, can take to tackle these concerns and thus improve app quality. This article focuses on the use of checklists that can be applied to apps,, novel evaluation methods and suggestions for how clinical specialty organisations can develop a low-cost curated app repository with explicit risk and quality criteria.
30501638#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Clinicians and professional societies must act now to ensure they are using good quality apps,, support patients in choosing between available apps and improve the quality of apps under development. Funders must also invest in research to answer important questions about apps,, such as how clinicians and patients decide which apps to use and which app factors are associated with effectiveness.

35020552#ABSTRACT##This article describes the development and preliminary psychometric properties of the TeleWrite,, a handwriting assessment tool designed to measure the rate,, accuracy,, and fluency of children's handwriting for children in first through third grade administered via telehealth. A series of three pilot studies were completed to determine initial interrater reliability,, content validity,, and clinical utility of the TeleWrite. A study with eight children was used to determine preliminary interrater reliability testing using a beta version of the TeleWrite with (n?=?9) raters. The reliability coefficient was obtained using intraclass correlation (ICC) and yielded a?=?0.92 for total scores,, CI [0.815,, 0.983] and the Cronbach's a measure for internal consistency was a?=?0.95 (excellent). A clinical utility survey of (n?=?55) pediatric occupational therapists was used to obtain their clinical impression regarding the usefulness and accuracy. Representing twelve different countries and twenty-two U.S. states,, the respondents indicated that 61% (n?=?33) are quite or extremely likely to use the TeleWrite in their practice and most participants (64%; n?=?35) indicated that TeleWrite was quite/extremely accurate in measuring handwriting performance. Third,, a content validity study with nine handwriting experts reviewed and concluded that all ten subtests of the TeleWrite tool are considered essential. All preliminary studies strengthen the development of the TeleWrite assessment to advance to construct validation of the tool.

34224437#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#Despite cutting edge acute interventions and growing preventive strategies supported by robust clinical trials,, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has stubbornly persisted as a leading cause of death in the United States and globally. The American Heart Association recognizes mobile health technologies (mHealth) as an emerging strategy in the mitigation of CVD risk factors,, with significant potential for improving population health. The purpose of this review is to highlight and summarize the latest available literature on mHealth applications and provide perspective on future directions and barriers to implementation.

34224437#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#While available randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews tend to support efficacy of mHealth,, published literature includes heterogenous approaches to similar problems with inconsistent results. Some of the strongest recent evidence has been focused on the use of wearables in arrhythmia detection. Systematic reviews of mHealth approaches demonstrate benefit when applied to risk factor modification in diabetes,, cigarette smoking cessation,, and physical activity/weight loss,, while also showing promise in multi risk factor modification via cardiac rehabilitation.
34224437#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#Evidence supports efficacy of mHealth in a variety of applications for CVD prevention and management,, but continued work is needed for further validation and scaling. Future directions will focus on platform optimization,, data and sensor consolidation,, and clinical workflow integration. Barriers include application heterogeneity,, lack of reimbursement structures,, and inequitable access to technology. Policies to promote access to technology will be critical to evidence-based mHealth technologies reaching diverse populations and advancing health equity.

33556151#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the resilience of public health,, including diagnostic testing,, antiviral development and transmission prevention. In addition,, it also affected the medical education of many residents and learners throughout the country. Historically,, physicians undergoing their residency training were not involved in telemedicine. However,, in response to the challenges faced due to COVID-19,, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) released a provision in May 2020 to allow residents to participate in telemedicine.
33556151#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Lincoln Medical Center,, located in the South Bronx of New York City,, currently has 115 Internal Medicine residents,, and telemedicine clinic visits have been conducted by residents since June 2020. An anonymous 25-question survey was sent to all Internal Medicine residents between August 8,, 2020 to August 14,, 2020.
33556151#ABSTRACT#RESULT#Of 115 residents,, 95 (82.6% of the residents) replied to this questionnaire. Residents revealed feeling less confident in managing chronic diseases through telemedicine visits. The survey also shows that 83.1% of respondents prefer in-person visits during their training,, 65.3% feel that the telemedicine experience will affect their future career choice,, and 67.4% would prefer less than 50% of visits to be telemedicine in their future careers.
33556151#ABSTRACT#OUTCOME#The purpose of the new ACGME rules allowing telemedicine was to prevent the undertraining of residents and maintain health care for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affects residency training and the experiences of residents,, which in turn can influence their future career plans.

35263178#ABSTRACT##Introduction: Cost studies of telehealth (TH) and virtual visits are few and report mixed results of the economic impact of virtual care and TH. Largely missing from the literature are studies that identify the cost of delivering TH versus in-person care. The objective was to demonstrate a modified time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) approach to compare weighted labor cost of an in-person pediatric clinic sick visit before COVID-19 to the same virtual and in-person sick-visit during COVID-19. Methods: We examined visits before and during COVID-19 using: (1) recorded structured interviews with providers; (2) iterative workflow mapping; (3) electronic health records time stamps for validation; (4) standard cost weights for wages; and (5) clinic CPT billing code mix for complexity weighs. We examined the variability in estimated time using a decision tree model and Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Workflow charts were created for the clinic before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Using TDABC and simulations for varying time,, the weighted cost of clinic labor for sick visit before COVID-19 was $54.47 versus $51.55 during COVID-19. Discussion: The estimated mean labor cost for care during the pandemic has not changed from the pre-COVID period; however,, this lack of a difference is largely because of the increased use of TH. Conclusions: Our TDABC approach is feasible to use under virtual working conditions; requires minimal provider time for execution; and generates detailed cost estimates that have "face validity" with providers and are relevant for economic evaluation.

23739374#ABSTRACT##The paper describes a tele-rehabilitation system for simultaneous motor rehabilitation (post-stroke and post-arthroscopy) and continuous patient's condition assessment with the focus on patient safety observations. Micro-electro-mechanical accelerometer and gyroscope sensors attached to the patient gather information about the performed therapeutic exercises. The measurement data processing of the vital sign sensors and accelerometers is done in the health hub device in real time with the patient feedback. Model verification is used for providing that the specified requirements have been actually fulfilled. By the safety model validation,, we supplement clinical evaluation,, which means the efficacy of the system is proven by the rules given by the physician for the particular patient.
23400146#ABSTRACT##The combination of smart phones,, wearable sensor devices and social media offer new ways of monitoring and promoting mental and physical wellbeing. In this contribution,, we describe recent developments in the field of mobile healthcare (or mHealth),, by focusing in particular on mobile mental health applications. First,, we examine the potential benefits associated with this approach,, providing examples from existing projects. Next,, we identify and explain possible differences in focus between mobile mental health and mobile wellbeing applications. Finally,, we discuss some open challenges associated with the implementation of this vision,, ranging from the lack of evidence-based validation to privacy,, security and ethical concerns.

25677956#ABSTRACT##Recent advanced technology enables the telecare medicine information system (TMIS) for the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and also to access medical services over the Internet of mobile networks. Several remote user authentication schemes have been proposed in the literature for TMIS. However,, most of them are either insecure against various known attacks or they are inefficient. Recently,, Tan proposed an efficient user anonymity preserving three-factor authentication scheme for TMIS. In this paper,, we show that though Tan's scheme is efficient,, it has several security drawbacks such as (1) it fails to provide proper authentication during the login phase,, (2) it fails to provide correct updation of password and biometric of a user during the password and biometric update phase,, and (3) it fails to protect against replay attack. In addition,, Tan's scheme lacks the formal security analysis and verification. Later,, Arshad and Nikooghadam also pointed out some security flaws in Tan's scheme and then presented an improvement on Tan's s scheme. However,, we show that Arshad and Nikooghadam's scheme is still insecure against the privileged-insider attack through the stolen smart-card attack,, and it also lacks the formal security analysis and verification. In order to withstand those security loopholes found in both Tan's scheme,, and Arshad and Nikooghadam's scheme,, we aim to propose an effective and more secure three-factor remote user authentication scheme for TMIS. Our scheme provides the user anonymity property. Through the rigorous informal and formal security analysis using random oracle models and the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool,, we show that our scheme is secure against various known attacks,, including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore,, our scheme is also efficient as compared to other related schemes.

32827787#ABSTRACT##Muscle strength and force production are important measures of patient progress during physical rehabilitation. Reliable and objective measurements are important to ascertain throughout rehabilitation. Current methods-manual muscle testing,, electromechanical dynamometer,, and hand-held dynamometer-are accurate and reliable,, but have limitations that prevent wide implementation. As healthcare systems adapt to more patient-centered outcome models,, changes to the delivery of rehabilitation,, whether at-home or in the clinic,, must also change to become more cost effective and accessible and provide quantifiable information regarding patient progress. We developed a novel Force Sensing (FoSe) device to quantify either tensile or compressive isometric muscle strength. The device was tested in a laboratory setting with healthy participants (n = 32) and compared to the commonly used hand-held dynamometer (HHD). Participants used both devices to perform several common isometric muscle tests including: hip abduction,, knee extension,, knee flexion,, shoulder external rotation,, and shoulder internal rotation. Compared to the HHD,, FoSe was found to be an accurate and reliable measurement of force production. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranged from 0.58 to 0.89 without a magnitude dependent variation in force measurement. A second round of clinical testing with a patient population is warranted to determine FoSe's ability to measure clinically relevant asymmetry and progress over time. Further usability testing also needs to be conducted to determine the adequacy of FoSe for at-home use by both patients and clinicians.

36563469#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health informatics competency standards for nurses are required to ensure the use and management of health information technologies contributes to the delivery and management of safe,, quality care delivery. Historically,, these competencies have been identified for nurses as a general group and specifically for undergraduate nursing students but not to the same extent for nurse leaders.
36563469#ABSTRACT#AIM#The aim of this study was to validate and prioritise health informatics competencies for Australian nurse leaders.
36563469#ABSTRACT#METHOD#This study utilised a modified Delphi technique to validate and prioritise 26 health informatics competencies for the Australian setting. The competencies were previously developed for Canadian nurses through literature review and consulation with experts. This modified Delphi study included invitations to 20 Australian Chief Nursing Information Officers who were then asked to extend the invitation to nurse leaders in their corresponding organisations.
36563469#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Eleven Chief Nursing Information Officers and seven Nurse Leaders completed the study including 3 rounds of informatics competencies consensus surveys. As a result,, 22 revised competency statements were agreed to by the study participants. The top priority competency (Nursing and Midwifery leaders support clinicians to adopt and use information and communication technologies that support safe,, quality care delivery) was also the highest ranked in the Canadian team's initial work. This reflects a common objective of nurses' need to ensure technology is fit for purpose,, not only for nurses and midwives,, but for patient safety and quality of care.
36563469#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Knowledge is required in the digital health landscape in order for nursing leaders to increase their capability in decision-making in the current and future digital healthcare environments. Differences in the competencies validated and prioritised by Australian nurse leaders and previous work by Canadian nurse leaders support the need to examine context-specific factors for nurse leaders to utilise these competencies.

29300701#ABSTRACT##Diet and physical activity are known as important lifestyle factors in self-management and prevention of many chronic diseases. Mobile sensors such as accelerometers have been used to measure physical activity or detect eating time. In many intervention studies,, however,, stringent monitoring of overall dietary composition and energy intake is needed. Currently,, such a monitoring relies on self-reported data by either entering text or taking an image that represents food intake. These approaches suffer from limitations such as low adherence in technology adoption and time sensitivity to the diet intake context. In order to address these limitations,, we introduce development and validation of Speech2Health,, a voice-based mobile nutrition monitoring system that devises speech processing,, natural language processing (NLP),, and text mining techniques in a unified platform to facilitate nutrition monitoring. After converting the spoken data to text,, nutrition-specific data are identified within the text using an NLP-based approach that combines standard NLP with our introduced pattern mapping technique. We then develop a tiered matching algorithm to search the food name in our nutrition database and accurately compute calorie intake values. We evaluate Speech2Health using real data collected with 30 participants. Our experimental results show that Speech2Health achieves an accuracy of 92.2% in computing calorie intake. Furthermore,, our user study demonstrates that Speech2Health achieves significantly higher scores on technology adoption metrics compared to text-based and image-based nutrition monitoring. Our research demonstrates that new sensor modalities such as voice can be used either standalone or as a complementary source of information to existing modalities to improve the accuracy and acceptability of mobile health technologies for dietary composition monitoring.

25354948#ABSTRACT##Smartphones,, mobile applications ('apps'),, social media,, analytics,, and the cloud are profoundly changing the practice of medicine and the way health decisions are made. With the constant progress of technology,, the measurement of vital signals becomes easier,, cheaper,, and practically a standard approach in clinical practice. The interest in measuring vital signals goes beyond medical professionals to the general public,, patients,, informal caregivers,, and healthy individuals,, who frequently lack any formal medical training. On smartphone platforms such as iOS and Android,, a proliferation of health or medical 'apps' acquire and analyse a variety of vital signs through embedded sensors,, interconnected devices or peripherals utilising on occasion analytics and social media. Smartphone vendors compete with traditional medical device manufacturers in the grey area between health care,, wellness,, and fitness,, as US and EU regulatory bodies are setting and revising rules for these new technologies. On the other hand,, in the absence of robust validation results,, clinicians are hesitant to trust measurements by apps or recommend specific apps to their patients,, partly also due to lack of a cost reimbursement policy. This review focuses on the acquisition and analysis on smartphones of three important vital signs in the cardiovascular and respiratory field as well as in rehabilitation i.e. heart or pulse rate,, blood pressure,, and blood oxygenation. The potential,, pitfalls,, and perspectives on mobile devices and smartphone apps for health management by patients and healthy individuals are discussed.

35463970#ABSTRACT##The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated implementation of telemedicine in healthcare facilities for delivery of care. Healthcare providers' acceptance of the telemedicine services is important for successful implementation of this new system. A questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been used to measure user acceptance of telemedicine service. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the English version of the questionnaire into Malay,, to extend the availability and utilization of this questionnaire in Malaysia. A forward and backward translation of the questionnaire was conducted to produce the TAM in the Malay version (Malay-TAM). Panel experts assessed content validity. Internal consistency reliability was determined using Cronbach's alpha. Confirmatory factor analysis based on structural equation modelling was performed to validate the factor structure. The questionnaire was then tested on and completed by 149 healthcare workers from several public health clinics across Malaysia. The Malay-TAM demonstrated good reliability with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.823 to 0.912. Factor analysis showed good convergent validity but relatively poor discriminant validity. All five constructs were retained to preserve content validity. The findings suggest that the Malay-TAM can serve as a reliable and valid instrument to measure acceptance to telemedicine.

22518025#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Complete survey information was obtained for 170 of 311 ICUs sent invitations. Analysis of a subset of surveys from 45 ICUs with complete data from more than one rater indicated that the survey reliability was in the excellent to nearly perfect range. Coefficients for measures of external validation ranged from 0.63 to 1.0. Analyses of the survey revealed substantial variation in the practice of ICU telemedicine,, including ICU telemedicine center staffing patterns; qualifications of providers; case sign-out,, ICU staffing models,, leadership,, and governance; intensivist review for new patients; adherence to best practices; use of quality and safety information; and ICU physician sign out for their patients.
22518025#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The American College of Chest Physicians ICU telemedicine survey is a reliable tool for measuring variation among ICUs with regard to staffing,, structure,, processes of care,, and ICU telemedicine practices.

29383394#ABSTRACT##Legitimately categorizing software in the healthcare sector is complex. According to European medical devices law,, software can be considered a medical device. The decisive factor is whether the software is used for directly controlling a therapeutic or diagnostic medical device or as stand-alone software that achieves specific medical purposes,, as they are described in the legal definition of a medical device. A contribution of the software to diagnosis or therapy can be sufficient for the categorization; it does not have to provide the complete diagnosis or the complete therapy itself.This principle will continue to be the same with the new Regulation on Medical Devices (EU) 2017/745,, even though the classification rules have been more closely and more specifically tailored to software and more stringent requirements for essential safety and performance requirements have to be met.

28516492#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine has become an important element of health care in many countries and profited from the technological progress of the last two decades. Due to the visual character of the dermatological specialty,, teledermatology in particular participated in that development and is becoming a major tool in dermatological consultation. The objective of this article was to identify the use of teledermatology across the world based on published original articles. A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases for eligible publications (predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria) and a cross-validation search were conducted. Search results were reviewed systematically. The search resulted in 204 publications meeting the inclusion criteria for analysis. The highest number of published studies on teledermatology was performed in the United States,, followed by the United Kingdom,, Spain,, the Netherlands,, Italy and Austria. The majority of dermatological indications for telemedical consultations were not specified or included various kinds of skin diseases,, followed by skin cancer and wounds. Research questions predominantly focused on concordance,, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to determine the value. Teledermatology proved to be a reliable consultation tool in the majority of studies. If specified,, telemedicine was used in daily dermatological routine for patient management purposes,, to consult patients in peripheral locations,, or for medical support in nursing homes or home care settings. The application of teledermatology worldwide is highest in North American and European countries,, while countries with poor geographical distribution of physicians seem to be under-represented in teledermatological use,, as concluded from publication output. Regarding indications,, comparison with classic consultation and area of application,, most studies were of general nature. For precise determination of the value,, systematic studies would be needed. However,, teledermatology is already accepted as a valid tool.

22829229#ABSTRACT##The access of rural Mental Health Care Users in South Africa to specialist psychiatrists and quality mental health care is currently sub-optimal. Health professionals and planners working in psychiatry lack a well-defined and feasible outreach model to facilitate the delivery of services to remote and rural areas. In response to this challenge,, a three-year action research telepsychiatry study was undertaken by the Departments of Psychiatry and TeleHealth at the University of KwaZulu-Natal,, to develop a telepsychiatry outreach model based on local research and international evidence. The Model draws on needs and infrastructure assessments of the designated psychiatric hospitals in the province,, a review of the published international evidence on telepsychiatry and videoconference-based education,, and an evaluation of local clinical and educational telepsychiatry implementations in KwaZulu-Natal. The Model proposed is "virtual",, i.e. not bound to provincial or district referral patterns,, aims not to add to the burden on the current workforce and is intended to be integrated into psychiatry outreach services and policy. The Model should be subjected to in situ testing for validation and implementation. It is hoped that an implementation of this Model will improve the access of Mental Health Care Users to specialist psychiatry care.
29232182#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telemedicine is becoming increasingly important in Ecuador,, especially in areas such as rural primary healthcare and medical education. Rural telemedicine programs in the country need to be strengthened by means of a technological platform adapted to local surroundings and offering advantages such as access to specialized care,, continuing education,, and so on,, combined with modest investment requirements.
29232182#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#This present article presents the design of a Telemedicine Platform (TMP) for rural healthcare services in Ecuador and a preliminary technical validation with medical students and teachers.
29232182#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#An initial field study was designed to capture the requirements of the TMP. In a second phase,, the TMP was validated in an academic environment along three consecutive academic courses. Assessment was by means of user polls and analyzing user interactions as registered automatically by the platform. The TMP was developed using Web-based technology and open code software.
29232182#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#One hundred twenty-four students and 6 specialized faculty members participated in the study,, conducting a total of 262 teleconsultations of clinical cases and 226 responses,, respectively.
29232182#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The validation results show that the TMP is a useful communication tool for the documentation and discussion of clinical cases. Moreover,, its usage may be recommended as a teaching methodology,, to strengthen the skills of medical undergraduates. The results indicate that implementing the system in rural healthcare services in Ecuador would be feasible.

33916371#ABSTRACT##The possibilities and implementation of wearable cardiac monitoring beyond atrial fibrillation are increasing continuously. This review focuses on the real-world use and evolution of these devices for other arrhythmias,, cardiovascular diseases and some of their risk factors beyond atrial fibrillation. The management of nonatrial fibrillation arrhythmias represents a broad field of wearable technologies in cardiology using Holter,, event recorder,, electrocardiogram (ECG) patches,, wristbands and textiles. Implementation in other patient cohorts,, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),, heart failure or sleep apnea,, is feasible and expanding. In addition to appropriate accuracy,, clinical studies must address the validation of clinical pathways including the appropriate device and clinical decisions resulting from the surrogate assessed.

35719047#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND/AIMS#Constipation can be a chronic condition that impacts daily functioning and quality of life (QoL). To aid healthcare providers in accurately assessing patient symptoms and treatment outcomes,, patient-related outcome measures (PROMs) have been increasingly adopted in clinical settings. This review aims to (1) evaluate the methodological quality and measurement properties of constipation-related PROMs,, using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INtruments (COSMIN) criteria; and (2) assess the modes of digital dissemination of constipation-related PROMs.
35719047#ABSTRACT#METHODS#PubMed,, Embase,, and PsycINFO databases were searched and 11 011 records ranging from 1989 to 2020 were screened by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 26 studies (23 PROMs; 18 measuring symptom-related items and 5 measuring constipation-related QoL items) were identified for the review and assessed.

35719047#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There were multiple variations between PROMs,, including subtypes of constipation,, methods of administration,, length of PROM and recall period. While no PROM met all the COSMIN quality standards for development and measurement properties,, 5 constipation-related PROMs received at least 4 (out of 7) sufficient ratings. Only 2 PROMs were developed in Asia. Five PROMs were administered through digital methods during the validation process but methods of adapting the PROMs into digital formats were not reported.
35719047#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The constipation-related PROMs identified in this review present varying quality of development and validation,, with an overall need for improvement. Further considerations should be given towards more consistent methodology and reporting of PROM development,, increase in culturally-specific PROMs,, and better reporting of protocol for the digitisation of PROMs.

30043085#ABSTRACT##Promoting patient care is a priority for all healthcare providers with the overall purpose of realising a high degree of patient satisfaction. A medical centre server is a remote computer that enables hospitals and physicians to analyse data in real time and offer appropriate services to patients. The server can also manage,, organise and support professionals in telemedicine. Therefore,, a remote medical centre server plays a crucial role in sustainably delivering quality healthcare services in telemedicine. This article presents a comprehensive review of the provision of healthcare services in telemedicine applications,, especially in the medical centre server. Moreover,, it highlights the open issues and challenges related to providing healthcare services in the medical centre server within telemedicine. Methodological aspects to control and manage the process of healthcare service provision and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first phase presents the identification process to propose a decision matrix (DM) on the basis of a crossover of 'multi-healthcare services' and 'hospital list' within intelligent data and service management centre (Tier 4). The second phase discusses the development of a DM for hospital selection on the basis of integrated VIKOR-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods. Finally,, the last phase examines the validation process for the proposed framework.

29654523#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#Advances in technology have expanded telemedicine opportunities covering medical practice,, research,, and education. This is of particular importance in movement disorders (MDs),, where the combination of disease progression,, mobility limitations,, and the sparse distribution of MD specialists increase the difficulty to access. In this review,, we discuss the prospects,, challenges,, and strategies for telemedicine in MDs.
29654523#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#Telemedicine for MDs has been mainly evaluated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and compared to in-office care is cost-effective with similar clinical care,, despite the barriers to engagement. However,, particular groups including pediatric patients,, rare MDs,, and the use of telemedicine in underserved areas need further research. Interdisciplinary telemedicine and tele-education for MDs are feasible,, provide similar care,, and reduce travel costs and travel time compared to in-person visits. These benefits have been mainly demonstrated for PD but serve as a model for further validation in other movement disorders.

19471032#ABSTRACT##The reliability and validity of assessments and diagnoses made via home telehealth was measured in 42 patients with spinal cord injury. Two telehealth modalities were investigated: telephone-only contact and videoconferencing. The results were compared with a reference (gold-standard) method,, the in-person assessment and diagnosis of skin integrity and pressure ulcers. The agreement on the presence of a pressure ulcer was excellent for both telephone and videoconferencing approaches (92% for telephone,, 97% for videoconferencing). The diagnoses of the stage of pressure ulcer (on an ordinal scale of 0-4) made via telephone and videoconferencing showed substantial to almost perfect agreement with the in-person diagnoses (Spearman's rho of 0.76 and 0.83,, respectively). There was a tendency for the measurements of wound volume to be somewhat larger in the telephone and videoconferencing modalities compared to those made in-person. Bland-Altman plots showed that videoconferencing gave substantially narrower 95% limits of agreement. The findings of the study indicate that telephone contact can be a useful tool for identifying the presence of a pressure ulcer,, but videoconferencing is required to obtain an evaluation reasonably close to that of a home visit.

36434742#ABSTRACT##Digital health is an umbrella term which encompasses eHealth and benefits from areas such as advanced computer sciences. eHealth includes mHealth apps,, which offer the potential to redesign aspects of healthcare delivery. The capacity of apps to collect large amounts of longitudinal,, real-time,, real-world data enables the progression of biomedical knowledge. Apps for rhinitis and rhinosinusitis were searched for in the Google Play and Apple App stores,, via an automatic market research tool recently developed using JavaScript. Over 1500 apps for allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis were identified,, some dealing with multimorbidity. However,, only six apps for rhinitis (AirRater,, AllergyMonitor,, AllerSearch,, Husteblume,, MASK-air and Pollen App) and one for rhinosinusitis (Galenus Health) have so far published results in the scientific literature. These apps were reviewed for their validation,, discovery of novel allergy phenotypes,, optimisation of identifying the pollen season,, novel approaches in diagnosis and management (pharmacotherapy and allergen immunotherapy) as well as adherence to treatment. Published evidence demonstrates the potential of mobile health apps to advance in the characterisation,, diagnosis and management of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis patients.

21965380#ABSTRACT##BACKGROUND Many hospitals have well-planned nursing competency assessment programs,, but these are meant to measure competency in traditional bedside roles,, not in tele-intensive care unit (tele-ICU) nurses practicing remotely. OBJECTIVE To determine whether current tele-ICU programs have a formal competency assessment program and to determine when and how competency of tele-ICU nurses is assessed. Method A 20-question survey was provided to a convenience sample of the 44 known tele-ICU programs nationally. RESULTS Of the surveys distributed,, 75% were completed and returned. A formal competency assessment policy for assessing nurses' competency at the time of hire,, during orientation,, and ongoing was in place at the workplaces of 85% of respondents. The most common methods for competency validation were performance appraisal and observation,, although peer review and self-assessment also were used. Respondents identified the following competencies as the highest priorities for defining tele-ICU nurse practice: effective listening,, prioritization,, collaboration,, and effective use of tele-ICU application tools. CONCLUSION Although awaiting development of professional practice standards,, many tele-ICU programs currently measure the competence of tele-ICU nurses through competency programs.

32770709#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#A remote quality assurance and improvement protocol for point-of-care obstetric ultrasound in low-resource areas was validated against the standard of care for obstetric ultrasound in the United States.
32770709#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Compressed movie clip ultrasound images (obstetric sweep protocol) obtained by minimally trained personnel were read and interpreted by physicians with training in obstetric ultrasound. Observed findings were compared among readers and between each reader and the gold standard ultrasound scan report. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.
35037894#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Following a scoping review approach,, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify perinatal mental health assessment apps. A total of 14 apps that met the inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner using the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. The framework comprised 107 questions,, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of app origin,, functionality,, engagement features,, security,, and clinical use.

32890524#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Responses were collected from 56 patients,, 12 RO attendings,, and 13 RO residents. Patient feedback was collected at 17 new-patient,, 22 on-treatment,, and 17 follow-up video visits. Overall,, 88% of patients were satisfied with virtual visits. A lower proportion of on-treatment patients rated their virtual visit as "very satisfactory" (68.2% vs 76.5% for new patients and 82.4% for follow-ups). Only 5.9% of the new patients and none of the follow-up patients were dissatisfied,, and 27% of on-treatment patients were dissatisfied. The large majority of patients (88%) indicated that they would continue to use virtual visits as long as a physical examination was not needed. Overall scores for medical training were 4.1 out of 5 (range,, 2.8-5.0) by RO residents and 3.2 (range,, 2.0-4.0) by RO attendings. All residents and 92% of attendings indicated they would use telemedicine again; however,, most indicated that telemedicine is best for follow-up visits.
32890524#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Telemedicine is a convenient means of delivering care to patients,, with some limitations demonstrated for on-treatment patients. The majority of both patients and providers are interested in using telemedicine again,, and it will likely continue to supplement patient care.

32770709#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The agreements among readers and between readers and the gold standard,, for the anterior and posterior variables of the placental location were excellent,, with Cohen ? values of 0.81 to 0.88 and 0.77 to 0.9,, respectively. Cohen ? values were slight or slight/fair for other placental locations (left,, right,, fundal,, and low),, and the sensitivity and specificity ranged widely. The agreement among readers and between readers and the gold standard for fetal number comparisons was also excellent,, with Cohen ? values ranging from 0.82 to 1,, sensitivity from 0.83 to 1,, and specificity from 0.99 to 1. The agreement among readers for fetal presentation comparisons,, according to the Cohen ?,, ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 and between readers and the gold standard had values of 0.43 to 0.49. For biometric parameters and estimated gestational age calculations based on these parameters,, inter-reader reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for all parameters except femur length. Greater than 94% of obstetric sweep protocol ultrasound ages were within 7?days of the corresponding gold standard age.
32770709#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Movie clip ultrasound images provided adequate information for remote readers to reliably determine the placental location,, fetal number,, fetal presentation,, and pregnancy dating.

35037894#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Most apps were developed by for-profit companies (n=10),, followed by private individuals (n=2) and trusted health care companies (n=2). Out of the 14 apps,, 3 were available only on Android devices,, 4 were available only on iOS devices,, and 7 were available on both platforms. Approximately one-third of the apps (n=5) had been updated within the last 180 days. A total of 12 apps offered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in its original version or in rephrased versions. Engagement,, input,, and output features included reminder notifications,, connections to therapists,, and free writing features. A total of 6 apps offered psychoeducational information and references. Privacy policies were available for 11 of the 14 apps,, with a median Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level of 12.3. One app claimed to be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and 2 apps claimed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation. Of the apps that could be accessed in full (n=10),, all appeared to fulfill the claims stated in their description. Only 1 app referenced a relevant peer-reviewed study. All the apps provided a warning for use,, highlighting that the mental health assessment result should not be interpreted as a diagnosis or as a substitute for medical care. Only 3 apps allowed users to export or email their mental health test results.
35037894#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These results indicate that there are opportunities to improve perinatal mental health assessment apps. To this end,, we recommend focusing on the development and validation of more comprehensive assessment tools,, ensuring data protection and safety features are adequate for the intended app use,, and improving data sharing features between users and health care professionals for timely support.

27402315#ABSTRACT##BACKGROUND According to the guidelines of the European Scientific Consensus on Hearing (European Federation of Audiology Societies 'EFAS' Congress,, June 2011,, Warsaw,, Poland),, the detection and treatment of communication disorders in early school-age children is of the highest importance. This objective was adopted by the Polish president of the EFAS Council from the second half of 2011; as a result,, pilot programs on children's hearing screening were initiated in various European countries. This paper reports data from a pilot program in Dushanbe,, Tajikistan. MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly selected 143 children from 2 primary schools. Each child was assessed by pure tone audiometry and 2 questionnaires (dedicated to parents and children). The study allowed the validation of: (i) hearing screening procedures in young children,, and (ii) data collection via a telemedicine model. RESULTS Hearing impairments were identified in 34 cases (23.7%) with a 50% ratio between unilateral and bilateral losses. We found a higher incidence of hearing impairment in children than that reported in previous Polish studies. CONCLUSIONS The data from the present study suggest that it is possible to use a telemedicine model to assess the hearing status of children and to provide a long-distance expert assistance. The latter is very important for rural areas without specialized medical services.

33442862#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine and remote visits are becoming more and more popular in several medical disciplines,, including oncology. The Covid-19 pandemic has enhanced the need to continue to meet patients' ambulatory care necessities ensuring social distancing and limiting the access to clinical facilities. The National Cancer Institute of Aviano,, Italy,, has recently launched a program called "Doctor @ Home" (D@H). The pillars of the program are the co-production of the oncological care and the co-learning approach,, which sees the clinical staff "hand in hand" with patients to maximize the outcome of the care,, trying to take advantage of the new tools offered by modern technologies.

31099337#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Blockchain is emerging as an innovative technology for secure data management in many areas,, including medical practice. A distributed blockchain network is tolerant against network fault,, and the registered data are resistant to tampering and revision. The technology has a high affinity with digital medicine like mobile health (mHealth) and provides reliability to the medical data without labor-intensive third-party contributions. On the other hand,, the reliability of the medical data is not insured before registration to the blockchain network. Furthermore,, there are issues with regard to how the clients' mobile devices should be dealt with and authenticated in the blockchain network in order to avoid impersonation.
31099337#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of the study was to design and validate an mHealth system that enables the compatibility of the security and scalability of the medical data using blockchain technology.
31099337#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We designed an mHealth system that sends medical data to the blockchain network via relay servers. The architecture provides scalability and convenience of operation of the system. In order to ensure the reliability of the data from clients' mobile devices,, hash values with chain structure (client hashchain) were calculated in the clients' devices and the results were registered on the blockchain network.
31099337#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The system was applied and deployed in mHealth for insomnia treatment. Clinical trials for mHealth were conducted with insomnia patients. Medical data of the recruited patients were successfully registered with the blockchain network via relay servers along with the hashchain calculated on the clients' mobile devices. The correctness of the data was validated by identifying illegal data,, which were made by simulating fraudulent access.
31099337#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our proposed mHealth system,, blockchain combined with client hashchain,, ensures compatibility of security and scalability in the data management of mHealth medical practice.

29137959#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Analysis with real-world interpretation of home monitoring technologies,, including current adoption barriers and expanded future demands based on demographic and market forces.
29137959#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Remote patient monitoring represents a paradigm shift in the way physicians care for patients. Success depends on meeting several criteria,, among which are a recognized value proposition to the physician,, robust device performance validation,, ease of use for the patient,, reliability of connectivity,, safe and secure data transmission,, and economic feasibility. Ophthalmic diseases,, such as age-related macular degeneration,, glaucoma,, and diabetic retinopathy,, are ideal candidates for home monitoring practice integration. Established home monitoring technology is already facilitating early detection and improved visual outcomes for patients with age-related macular degeneration. Future innovation currently underway or on the horizon will continue to evolve and expand the footprint of telemedicine within ophthalmology.
29137959#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Home monitoring has the potential to enhance the patient-physician relationship and to positively impact visual acuity outcomes in ophthalmic diseases. Advances in technology,, demographic shifts,, market changes,, and patient demand for personalized medicine will require physicians to embrace technology in new and diverse ways,, perhaps facilitating widespread adoption of home monitoring technology platforms.
26290327#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There is growing evidence for the positive impact of mindfulness on wellbeing. Mindfulness-based mobile apps may have potential as an alternative delivery medium for training. While there are hundreds of such apps,, there is little information on their quality.
26290327#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of mindfulness-based iPhone mobile apps and to evaluate their quality using a recently-developed expert rating scale,, the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). It also aimed to describe features of selected high-quality mindfulness apps.
26290327#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A search for "mindfulness" was conducted in iTunes and Google Apps Marketplace. Apps that provided mindfulness training and education were included. Those containing only reminders,, timers or guided meditation tracks were excluded. An expert rater reviewed and rated app quality using the MARS engagement,, functionality,, visual aesthetics,, information quality and subjective quality subscales. A second rater provided MARS ratings on 30% of the apps for inter-rater reliability purposes.
26290327#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The "mindfulness" search identified 700 apps. However,, 94 were duplicates,, 6 were not accessible and 40 were not in English. Of the remaining 560,, 23 apps met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median MARS score was 3.2 (out of 5.0),, which exceeded the minimum acceptable score (3.0). The Headspace app had the highest average score (4.0),, followed by Smiling Mind (3.7),, iMindfulness (3.5) and Mindfulness Daily (3.5). There was a high level of inter-rater reliability between the two MARS raters.
26290327#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Though many apps claim to be mindfulness-related,, most were guided meditation apps,, timers,, or reminders. Very few had high ratings on the MARS subscales of visual aesthetics,, engagement,, functionality or information quality. Little evidence is available on the efficacy of the apps in developing mindfulness.

29265020#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES#A knowledge-based,, logically-linked online telepsychiatric decision support system for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders was developed and validated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the application at remote sites when used by non-psychiatrists who underwent a brief training in its use through video-conferencing.
29265020#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was conducted at a nodal telepsychiatry centre,, and three geographically remote peripheral centres. The diagnostic tool of application had a screening followed by detailed criteria-wise diagnostic modules for 18 psychiatric disorders. A total of 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients attending remote telepsychiatry centres were included. To assess inter-rater reliability,, patients were interviewed face to face by non-specialists at remote sites using the application (active interviewer) and simultaneously on online application via video-conferencing by a passive assessor at nodal centre. Another interviewer at the nodal centre rated the patient using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for diagnostic validation.
29265020#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Screening sub-module had high sensitivity (80-100%),, low positive predictive values (PPV) (0.10-0.71) but high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.97-1) for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules,, Cohen's kappa was >0.4 for all disorders,, with kappa of 0.7-1.0 for most disorders. PPV and NPV were high for most disorders. Inter-rater agreement analysis revealed kappa >0.6 for all disorders.
29265020#ABSTRACT#INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS#Diagnostic tool showed acceptable to good validity and reliability when used by non-specialists at remote sites. Our findings show that diagnostic tool of the telepsychiatry application has potential to empower non-psychiatrist doctors and paramedics to diagnose psychiatric disorders accurately and reliably in remote sites.

29693243#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Teledermatology may improve dermatologic care access in underserved areas and expand the clinical experience of dermatologists-in-training. The potential for teledermatology to supplement global health curricula in dermatology residency education has not been explored.
29693243#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An international virtual grand rounds (VGR) curriculum was created based on teledermatology cases from Kabul,, Afghanistan. The learning objectives included understanding the diagnosis and management of skin diseases in unfamiliar resource-limited settings and highlighting socioeconomic,, cross-cultural,, and ethical issues. A 17-item,, Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess the effectiveness of the curriculum,, including specific Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies,, as well as interest in global health and teledermatology.
29693243#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The survey was completed by 85 of 118 VGR attendees (72% response rate). Most respondents considered the curriculum valuable to their education (mean 4.5 on a 5-point Likert scale; standard deviation,, 0.5),, learned more about diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases in international settings (4.5; 0.6) and in the US (4.1; 0.8),, and learned more about socioeconomic,, cultural,, and ethical issues in skin health (4.6; 0.5). The majority also reported being more interested in global dermatology (4.1; 0.8) and would recommend VGR to a colleague (4.5; 0.6).
29693243#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This pilot curriculum provided an innovative platform to enhance undergraduate and graduate medical education in international dermatology. International teledermatology education may be used to address multiple ACGME core competencies and increase resident awareness of sociocultural determinants of skin health.

35357405#ABSTRACT#IMPORTANCE#Visual acuity (VA) is one of the most important clinical data points in ophthalmology. However,, few options for validated at-home VA assessments are currently available.
35357405#ABSTRACT#DESIGN,, SETTING,, AND PARTICIPANTS#Between July 2020 and April 2021,, eligible participants with VA of 20/200 or better were recruited from 4 university-based ophthalmology clinics (comprehensive,, cornea,, glaucoma,, and retina clinics). Participants were prospectively randomized to self-administer 2 of 3 at-home VA tests (printed chart,, mobile phone app,, and website) within 3 days before their standard-of-care clinic visit. Participants completed a survey assessing usability of the at-home tests. At the clinic visit,, best-corrected Snellen distance acuity was measured as the reference standard.
35357405#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES#The at-home VA test results were compared with the in-office VA test results using paired and unpaired t tests,, Pearson correlation coefficients,, analysis of variance,, ?2 tests,, and Cohen ? agreement. The sensitivity,, specificity,, positive predictive value,, and negative predictive value of each at-home test were calculated to detect significant VA changes (=0.2 logMAR) from the in-office baseline.
35357405#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 121 participants with a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (13.0) years completed the study. The mean in-office VA was 0.11 logMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/25) with similar numbers of participants from the 4 clinics. Mean difference (logMAR) between the at-home test and in-office acuity was -0.07 (95% CI,, -0.10 to -0.04) for the printed chart,, -0.12 (95% CI,, -0.15 to -0.09) for the mobile phone app,, and -0.13 (95% CI,, -0.16 to -0.10) for the website test. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the printed chart was 0.72 (95% CI,, 0.62-0.79),, mobile phone app was 0.58 (95% CI,, 0.46-0.69),, and website test was 0.64 (95% CI,, 0.53-0.73).
35357405#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE#The 3 at-home VA test results (printed chart,, mobile phone app,, and website) appeared comparable within 1 line to in-office VA measurements. Older participants were more likely to have limited access to digital tools. Further development and validation of at-home VA testing modalities is needed with the expansion of teleophthalmology care.

33063553#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#COVID-19 social isolation restrictions have accelerated the need to adapt clinical assessment tools to telemedicine. Remote adaptations are of special importance for populations at risk,, e.g. older adults and individuals with chronic medical comorbidities. In response to this urgent clinical and scientific need,, we describe a remote adaptation of the T-RES (Oron et al. 2020; IJA),, designed to assess the complex processing of spoken emotions,, based on identification and integration of the semantics and prosody of spoken sentences.
33063553#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#We present iT-RES,, an online version of the speech-perception assessment tool,, detailing the challenges considered and solution chosen when designing the telehealth tool. We show a preliminary validation of performance against the original lab-based T-RES.
33063553#ABSTRACT#STUDY SAMPLE#A between-participants design,, within two groups of 78 young adults (T-RES,, n?=?39; iT-RES,, n?=?39).
33063553#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#i-TRES performance closely followed that of T-RES,, with no group differences found in the main trends,, identification of emotions,, selective attention,, and integration.
33063553#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The design of iT-RES mapped the main challenges for remote auditory assessments,, and solutions taken to address them. We hope that this will encourage further efforts for telehealth adaptations of clinical services,, to meet the needs of special populations and avoid halting scientific research.

37239537#ABSTRACT##Artificial intelligence (AI) is recently seeing significant advances in teledermatology (TD),, also thanks to the developments that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last two years,, there was an important development of studies that focused on opportunities,, perspectives,, and problems in this field. The topic is very important because the telemedicine and AI applied to dermatology have the opportunity to improve both the quality of healthcare for citizens and the workflow of healthcare professionals. This study conducted an overview on the opportunities,, the perspectives,, and the problems related to the integration of TD with AI. The methodology of this review,, following a standardized checklist,, was based on: (I) a search of PubMed and Scopus and (II) an eligibility assessment,, using parameters with five levels of score. The outcome highlighted that applications of this integration have been identified in various skin pathologies and in quality control,, both in eHealth and mHealth. Many of these applications are based on Apps used by citizens in mHealth for self-care with new opportunities but also open questions. A generalized enthusiasm has been registered regarding the opportunities and general perspectives on improving the quality of care,, optimizing the healthcare processes,, minimizing costs,, reducing the stress in the healthcare facilities,, and in making citizens,, now at the center,, more satisfied. However,, critical issues have emerged related to: (a) the need to improve the process of diffusion of the Apps in the hands of citizens,, with better design,, validation,, standardization,, and cybersecurity; (b) the need for better attention paid to medico-legal and ethical issues; and (c) the need for the stabilization of international and national regulations. Targeted agreement initiatives,, such as position statements,, guidelines,, and/or consensus initiatives,, are needed to ensure a better result for all,, along with the design of both specific plans and shared workflows.

23958966#ABSTRACT##Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that,, if not treated promptly and appropriately,, can cause complex health complications and mortality. Changes in societal structure have fostered an increase in the incidence of diabetes and made the traditional hospital visit model less efficient for meeting the care needs of these patients. The care models that apply technology,, such as telecare or so-called telehealth,, may be useful in working with diabetes patients. The current study applied qualitative research methodology through interviews with nine diabetes case managers involved in telecare services. To identify the participants' acceptance and perceived effectiveness of telecare services,, content analysis of the interview data was used. The following four major themes were identified in the study results: (1) improved case management,, (2) setting appropriate expectations for care outcome,, (3) acknowledging patients' sense of losing privacy,, and (4) disease prevention and interdisciplinary cooperation. The study findings may serve as an indicator of the need for further promotion,, appraisal,, and validation of the telecare services model,, to enhance the comprehensiveness of diabetes care.
29893996#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#Each laboratory contributed 30 biopsies and/or excisions,, totalling 90 specimens (776 slides) of varying difficulty and covering a wide variety of organs and subspecialties. All slides were scanned centrally at ×40 scanning magnification and uploaded,, and subsequently assessed digitally by 16 pathologists using the same image management system and viewer. Each laboratory was excluded from digital assessment of their own cases. Concordance rates between the two diagnostic modalities (light microscopic versus digital) were compared. Loading speed of the images,, zooming latency and focus quality were scored. Leaving out eight minor discrepancies without any clinical significance,, the concordance rate between remote digital and original microscopic diagnoses was 97.8%. The two cases with a major discordance (for which the light microscopic diagnoses were deemed to be the better ones) resulted from a different interpretation of diagnostic criteria in one case and an image quality issue in the other case. Average scores for loading speed of the images,, zooming latency and focus quality were 2.37 (on a scale up to 3),, 2.39 (scale up to 3) and 3.06 (scale up to 4),, respectively.

28616846#ABSTRACT##The use of mobile health applications (apps) especially in the area of lifestyle behaviors has increased,, thus providing unprecedented opportunities to develop health programs that can engage people in real-time and in the real-world. Yet,, relatively little is known about which factors relate to the engagement of commercially available apps for health behaviors. This exploratory study examined behavioral engagement with a weight loss app,, Lose It! and characterized higher versus lower engaged groups. Cross-sectional,, anonymized data from Lose It! were analyzed (n = 12,,427,,196). This dataset was randomly split into 24 subsamples and three were used for this study (total n = 1,,011,,008). Classification and regression tree methods were used to identify subgroups of user engagement with one subsample,, and descriptive analyses were conducted to examine other group characteristics associated with engagement. Data mining validation methods were conducted with two separate subsamples. On average,, users engaged with the app for 29 days. Six unique subgroups were identified,, and engagement for each subgroup varied,, ranging from 3.5 to 172 days. Highly engaged subgroups were primarily distinguished by the customization of diet and exercise. Those less engaged were distinguished by weigh-ins and the customization of diet. Results were replicated in further analyses. Commercially-developed apps can reach large segments of the population,, and data from these apps can provide insights into important app features that may aid in user engagement. Getting users to engage with a mobile health app is critical to the success of apps and interventions that are focused on health behavior change.

19548827#ABSTRACT##The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) administration via telehealth with a focus on the auditory and visual test components. Reliability was assessed through use of an in-person collaborator and by assessment of faxed test copies. The MMSE was administered via telehealth with the assistance of a face-to-face collaborator. Patient responses were recorded by both the remote and in-person nurse and compared item by item; total scores for each subject were also compared. Visual items were assessed through a blinded separate scoring of a faxed copy. Percent agreement per item and total score were calculated and correlations between scores were determined by Pearson correlation coefficients. Mean score differences and associated 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Eighty percent of individual items demonstrated remote to in-person agreement of >95% and all items were >85.5% in agreement. Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated high correlations (>0.86) between 80% of the items examined. Mean differences in scored test items were not significantly different from zero. This study demonstrates the utility of using telehealth for cognitive assessment by MMSE. It supports the use of telehealth to improve healthcare access among patients for whom distance,, cost,, and mobility are potential barriers to attending face-to-face clinical visits. Continued validation and reliability testing is warranted to ensure that all healthcare provided via telehealth maintains an equal quality level to that of in-person care.

35503246#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, we identified 1764 apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. After removing apps that were not related to IBD (n=1386) or not available in German (n=317),, 61 apps remained. After removing duplicates (n=3) and apps for congresses (n=7),, journals (n=4),, and clinical studies (n=6),, as well as excluding apps that were available in only 1 of the 2 app stores (n=20) and apps that could only be used with an additional device (n=7),, we included a total of 14 apps. The app "CED Dokumentation und Tipps" had the highest overall median MARS score at 4.11/5. On the whole,, the median MARS scores of the 14 apps ranged between 2.38/5 and 4.11/5. As there was no significant difference between iPhone and Android raters,, we used the Wilcoxon comparison test to calculate P values.
35503246#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MARS ratings showed that the quality of German IBD apps varied. We also discovered a discrepancy between app store ratings and MARS ratings,, highlighting the difficulty of assessing perceived app quality. Despite promising results from international studies,, there is little evidence for the clinical benefits of German IBD apps. Clinical studies and patient inclusion in the app development process are needed to effectively implement mobile apps in routine care.

23500485#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Managing chronic disease through automated systems has the potential to both benefit the patient and reduce health-care costs. We have developed and evaluated a disease management system for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Its aim is to predict and detect exacerbations and,, through this,, help patients self-manage their disease to prevent hospitalisation.
23500485#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Model evaluation results show that we can reliably detect exacerbations. Pilot study results suggest that an intervention based on this system could be successful.

15360807#ABSTRACT##The primary aim of TOSCA-Imaging,, which was a part of the TOSCA Project financed by EU's Fifth Framework IST Programme,, was to develop Internet based software and image data bases for screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and implementing it into a real life situation. The work consisted of: 1) Construction of an Internet based communication platform for transmitting and analyzing retinal images. 2) Implementation of routines for detecting the first microaneurysm (transition from normal to pathologic),, detecting patients needing referral for treatment (presence of venous beading or hard exudates near the fovea),, and for serial analysis (image alignment). 3) Construction of a reference image data base. A preliminary validation showed that decisions that depended on a precise detection of individual lesions,, e.g. the detection of normality,, had a sensitivity and specificity of around 80%,, whereas decisions that depended on the detection of lesion patterns,, e.g. clinically significant macular oedema,, had a sensitivity and specificity of more than 95%. Validation of the reference image data base by double grading by two expert graders suggested a sensitivity and a specificity of just below 90% for any lesion and of more than 95% for predicting the overall retinopathy grade. TOSCA-Imaging has succeeded in its primary aim of developing Internet based software and implementing it into a real life situation,, integrating work within image processing done in four different European countries (England,, Germany,, Ireland,, and Denmark) to be accessed from one Internet web site.
23500485#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS#The carefully crafted intelligent system consists of a mobile device that is able to collect case-specific,, subjective and objective,, physiological data,, and to alert the patient by a patient-specific interpretation of the data by means of probabilistic reasoning. Collected data are also sent to a central server for inspection by health-care professionals.
23500485#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We evaluated the probabilistic model using cross-validation and ROC analyses on data from an earlier study and by an independent data set. Furthermore a pilot with actual COPD patients has been conducted to test technical feasibility and to obtain user feedback.

29261843#ABSTRACT#DESIGN,, SETTING,, AND PARTICIPANTS#This pilot reliability study enrolled consecutive patients with acne vulgaris from a single general dermatology practice in Los Angeles,, California,, who were able to use NORA on an iPhone 6 to take self-photographs. Patients were enrolled from January 1 through March 31,, 2016. Each individual underwent in-person and digital evaluation of his or her acne by the same dermatologist. A period of at least 1 week separated the in-person and digital assessments of acne.
29261843#ABSTRACT#INTERVENTIONS#All participants were trained on how to use NORA on the iPhone 6 and take photographs of their face with the rear-facing camera.
29261843#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES#Reliability of patient-taken photographs with NORA for acne evaluation compared with in-person examination findings. Acne assessment measures included lesion count (total,, inflammatory,, noninflammatory,, and cystic) and IGA for acne severity.
29261843#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 69 patients (37 male [54%] and 32 female [46%]; mean [SD] age,, 22.7 [7.7] years) enrolled in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficients of in-person and photograph-based acne evaluations indicated strong agreement. The intraclass correlation coefficient for total lesion count was 0.81; for the IGA,, 0.75. Inflammatory lesion count,, noninflammatory lesion count,, and cyst count had intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.72,, 0.72,, and 0.82,, respectively.
29261843#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE#This study found agreement between acne evaluations performed in person and from self-photographs with NORA. As a reliable telehealth technology for acne,, NORA can be used as a teledermatology platform for dermatology research and can increase access to dermatologic care.

32885319#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#COVID-19,, a worldwide pandemic,, has enforced a national lockdown in the UK which produced a paradigm shift about the way medical practitioners would perform consultations and communication with their patients. Senior authors realised that in lockdown there was only one option to see a patient: virtual consultation via telecommunication technologies. This paper will discuss the current benefits and considerations of Telemedicine,, particularly in plastic surgery,, to decipher the next route of action to further validate its use for future implementation.

32885319#ABSTRACT#METHOD#A detailed literature review was carried out comparing papers from 1992 to 2020. A survey of 122 consultant plastic surgeons found an encouraging result as 70% positively embraced the suggestion of Telemedicine in their current practice.
32885319#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Telemedicine produced equal or improved patient satisfaction. Its utilisation reduced cost for patient,, clinic and consultant. With accessibility to a large percentage of the population,, Telemedicine enables infection control and adherence to social distancing during COVID-19. Considerations include dependability on internet access,, legal aspects,, cyber security and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),, the inability to perform palpation or physical inspection and psychological impacts on the patient.
32885319#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In modern times,, Telemedicine has become more accessible and COVID-19 has made it more applicable than ever before. More in-depth research is needed for validation of this technique within plastic surgery. While maintaining quality of care and a vital role in social distancing,, there is a strong need for standardisation of Telemedicine processes,, platforms,, encryption and data storage.

33161791#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Adherence to evidence-based management is variable in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),, which leads to worse patient outcomes and higher healthcare utilization. Solutions include electronic systems to enhance care,, but these have often been limited by lack of clinician design input,, poor usability,, and low perceived value. A cloud-based IBD-specific clinical management software - 'Crohn's Colitis Care' (CCCare) was developed by Australia and New Zealand Inflammatory Bowel Disease Consortium clinicians and software developers to improve this.

33161791#ABSTRACT#METHODS#CCCare captures patient-reported disease activity and medical assessment,, medication monitoring,, cancer screening,, preventative health,, and facilitates communication with the IBD team and referring doctor. De-identified longitudinal data are stored separately in a clinical quality registry for research. CCCare was tested for feasibility and usability in routine clinical settings at two large Australian hospitals. Users' experience was evaluated with System Usability Scale (SUS). Value to clinicians and patients was assessed by qualitative feedback. Security was assessed by penetration testing.
33161791#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Users (n?=?13; doctors,, nurses,, patients) reported good usability and learnability (mean SUS score 75 (range 50-95),, sub-scores were 77 (50-94) and 68 (38-100),, respectively). Patients reported better communication with clinical team and greater ability to track disease. Clinicians highlighted structured management plans,, medication adherence,, and centralised data repository as positive features. Penetration testing was passed successfully.
33161791#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Initial evaluation demonstrates CCCare is usable,, secure,, and valued in clinical use. It is designed to measure outcomes of clinical care,, including efficacy,, quality,, cost,, and complications for individuals,, and to audit these at hospital and national level.

31633596#ABSTRACT##New modalities of evaluating histopathology,, such as whole-slide imaging,, have been validated in the field of dermatopathology but are often unfeasible and unavailable in developing countries. Widely available across the globe,, mobile phone camera technology represents a potential simple and inexpensive method of imaging histologic slides through the use of a mobile phone camera microscope adaptor. This study aims to validate the use of a commercially available adaptor in the diagnosis of inflammatory and infectious conditions in dermatopathology. Representative images were taken of slides for fifty-four cases using the adaptor and shared through a cloud-based platform with five dermatopathologists who rendered diagnoses and judged the quality of the images. After a washout period of 8 weeks,, the same cases were assessed by the same dermatopathologists using the original glass slides. The intraobserver concordance rate was 93.3%,, and the quality of the mobile phone images was rated as "excellent" or "diagnostic" in 94.4% of the cases. This study validates the use of this low-tech and low-cost adaptor as a reliable tool in teledermatopathology. Limitations of the study include those inherent to use of the adaptor and the limited panel of diagnoses. The primary value of this device may be in developing countries,, but its practicality and ease of use lend itself to use in academic and consultative settings in the developed world as well.
32830559#ABSTRACT##Consistently uncontrolled asthma in children is an increasing concern in the United States. The use of asthma action plans with asthma education is inconsistent and may be improved with adaptations for low literacy. The objective of this study was formative evaluation for implementation of the New Mexico Pictorial Asthma Action Plan (NM PicAAP). Quality improvement processes guided NM PicAAP face validation and telehealth direct patient care implementation. The asthma control test was selected to measure asthma control. NM PicAAP was revised for face validity,, and training curriculum on its use and telehealth implementation processes were developed. Seven youth received NM PicAAP via telehealth direct care,, which increased overall asthma control scores over 1 month. NM PicAAP may be useful and effective for improving asthma care in children via telehealth. Additional testing is needed to assess applicability.
34406461#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#The study included an analysis of current scientific publications,, analysis of unrestricted screening applications in smart device app stores as well as telemetric medical products specifically designed for home monitoring and discussion of the requirements of an integrated ophthalmologic video consultation.
34406461#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There is significant interest in tele-ophthalmologic applications and devices as evidenced by a rise in the number of relevant publications. Freely available screening tests for smart phones and tablets are as a rule currently not validated and show significant discrepancies from established standard tests. Telemetric medical devices show great potential for home monitoring in chronic ophthalmologic diseases but must first become established in the clinical routine.

27090865#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To study the comparability of self-operated endovaginal telemonitoring (SOET) with conventional two-dimensional transvaginal sonography (2D-TVS) monitoring during assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.
27090865#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#Single center,, observational,, single-blinded cohort study.
27090865#ABSTRACT#SETTING#University-affiliated in vitro fertilization center.
27090865#ABSTRACT#PATIENT(S)#A total of 60 women undergoing ART cycles.
27090865#ABSTRACT#INTERVENTION(S)#Explanation,, training,, and use of SOET system,, and measurements of follicular and endometrial diameter with SOET and 2D-TVS.
27090865#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)#Correlation of the total number of follicles >10 mm measured by SOET versus conventional 2D-TVS.
27090865#ABSTRACT#RESULT(S)#In 16 cases (26.7%) the images were judged unsuitable for analysis. In these excluded cases the body mass index (BMI) was statistically significantly higher (29.3 vs. 24.4 kg/m(2)). The total number of follicles >10 mm was highly similar comparing SOET with conventional 2D-TVS (r = 0.91). For the concordance of whether more than 19 follicles or more than 25 follicles >10 mm were present,, we found agreement between the methods in 43 of 44 cases (? = 0.88) and 43 of 44 cases (? = 0.85),, respectively. For concordance on predefined human chorionic gonadotropin administration criteria,, agreement was found in 39 of 44 cases (? = 0.734).
27090865#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION(S)#The incidence of SOET videos not suitable for analysis seems to be associated with higher BMI. Otherwise,, SOET showed good agreement with conventional 2D-TVS both for follicles and endometrium measurements. More importantly we also found good concordance regarding the cutoffs relevant for clinical decisions.

26418788#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The continental size of some countries and heterogeneous hospital network prevents patients who live in remote areas from getting adequate initial assessment of facial trauma. The authors present an alternative model for trauma assessment by videoconference via smartphones and analyze the concordance between telemedicine and face-to-face management.
26418788#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Fifty patients with either a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of facial trauma were independently evaluated by 2 teams of physicians: Face-to-face and telemedicine-based. The face-to-face team attended patients at bedside (physical examination and computed tomography scan analysis). The telemedicine team consisted of a general surgery resident on duty in the emergency room and a plastic surgeon researcher remotely communicating via smartphones. Both teams answered a questionnaire,, which contained data concerning patient's epidemiology,, physical examination,, computed tomography (CT) scan findings,, and treatment option to be followed. Data were analyzed and compared regarding the similarity of answers.
26418788#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The sample studied was consistent with the literature,, showing a predominance of young males. Traffic accidents and personal violence were the main causes of trauma. The concurrency of answers for physical examination findings was considered substantial (? = 0.720). For CT scan findings,, it was almost perfect (? = 0.899); for defining the treatment option,, it was almost perfect (? = 0.891). High concurrency of face CT scan findings was observed after we calculated the positive predictive value (89.9%),, negative predictive value (99.3%),, sensitivity (94.2%),, specificity (98.8%),, and accuracy (98.3%).
26418788#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed model to facial assessment trauma by videoconference via smartphones is feasible,, showing high concordance level with face-to-face assessment.

30664457#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Emotion dysregulation increases the risk of depression,, anxiety,, and substance use disorders. Music can help regulate emotions,, and mobile phones provide constant access to it. The Music eScape mobile app teaches young people how to identify and manage emotions using music.
30664457#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to examine the effects of using Music eScape on emotion regulation,, distress,, and well-being at 1,, 2,, 3,, and 6 months. Moderators of outcomes and user ratings of app quality were also examined.
30664457#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A randomized controlled trial compared immediate versus 1-month delayed access to Music eScape in 169 young people (aged 16 to 25 years) with at least mild levels of mental distress (Kessler 10 score>17).
30664457#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#No significant differences between immediate and delayed groups on emotion regulation,, distress,, or well-being were found at 1 month. Both groups achieved significant improvements in 5 of the 6 emotion regulation skills,, mental distress,, and well-being at 2,, 3,, and 6 months. Unhealthy music use moderated improvements on 3 emotion regulation skills. Users gave the app a high mean quality rating (mean 3.8 [SD 0.6]) out of 5.
30664457#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Music eScape has the potential to provide a highly accessible way of improving young people's emotion regulation skills,, but further testing is required to determine its efficacy. Targeting unhealthy music use in distressed young people may improve their emotion regulation skills.

27311090#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine applied to heart failure patients is a tool for recording,, remote transmission,, storage and interpretation of cardiocirculatory parameters and/or diagnostic images,, useful,, as emphasized by the latest guidelines,, to allow for intensive home monitoring in patients with advanced heart failure or during the vulnerable post-acute phase to improve the prognosis and quality of life for patients.Recently,, several meta-analyses have shown that the patterns of care supported by telemedicine are not only effective,, but also economically advantageous. The benefit is unquestionable with a 30-35% reduction in mortality and a 15-20% reduction in hospitalizations. Patients implanted with cardiac devices can also benefit from an integrated remote clinical management as all modern devices can transmit technical and diagnostic data. However,, telemedicine can bring benefits to the patient with heart failure only if it is part of a shared and integrated,, multidisciplinary and multiprofessional "Chronic Care Model". Moreover,, the future development of remote telemonitoring programs in our country goes through the primary use of products certified as medical device,, field validation of organizational solutions proposed,, a legislative and administrative adaptation to new care methods and the widespread growth of competence in clinical care to remotely manage the complexity of chronicity.With this consensus document the Italian Cardiology reaffirms its willingness to contribute to the government of the tumultuous and fragmented technological development,, proposing a new phase of qualitative assessment,, standardization of processes and testing the application of telemedicine to heart failure.

36964513#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND AIMS#Developing accessible,, affordable,, and effective approaches to smoking cessation is crucial for tobacco control. Mobile health (mHealth) based interventions have the potential to aid smokers in quitting,, and integrating treatments from multiple sources may further enhance their accessibility and effectiveness. As part of our efforts in smoking cessation,, we developed a novel behavioral intervention delivery modality for smoking cessation that integrated three interventions using the WeChat app,, called the "Way to Quit" modality (WQ modality). It is presented here the protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness,, feasibility,, and cost-effectiveness of the WQ modality in Chinese smokers.
36964513#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Eligible participants (n?=?460) will be recruited via online advertisement in Beijing,, China. They will be randomly assigned to receive either quitline-based treatment (QT,, n?=?230) or WQ modality-based treatment (WQ,, n?=?230) using a block randomization method. Participants in the QT group will receive telephone-assisted treatment over a four-week period (multi-call quitline protocol),, while those in the WQ group will receive integrated interventions based on the WQ modality for four weeks. A four-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (gums) will be provided to all participants. Participants will be asked to complete phone or online follow-up at 1,, 3,, 6,, and 12-months. At 1-month follow-up,, individuals with self-reported smoking abstinence for more than 7 days will be invited to receive an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) test for biochemical validation. The primary aim is to determine whether the WQ modality is effective in assisting smokers in quitting smoking. The secondary aims are to evaluate the acceptability,, satisfaction,, and cost-effectiveness of the WQ modality.
36964513#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#If the WQ modality is determined to be effective,, acceptable,, and affordable,, it will be relatively easy to reach and provide professional cessation treatments to the communities,, thus helping to reduce the disparities in smoking cessation services between different regions and socioeconomic groups.

33284123#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The rapid proliferation of web-based information on health and health care has profoundly changed individuals' health-seeking behaviors,, with individuals choosing the internet as their first source of information on their health conditions before seeking professional advice. However,, barriers to the evaluation of people's eHealth literacy present some difficulties for decision makers with respect to encouraging and empowering patients to use web-based resources.
33284123#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of a simplified Chinese version of the eHealth Literacy Scale (SC-eHEALS).
33284123#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data used for analysis were obtained from a cross-sectional multicenter survey. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the structure of the SC-eHEALS. Correlations between the SC-eHEALS and ICEpop capability measure for adults (ICECAP-A) items and overall health status were estimated to assess the convergent validity. Internal consistency reliability was confirmed using Cronbach alpha (a),, McDonald omega (?),, and split-half reliability (?). A general partial credit model was used to perform the item response theory (IRT) analysis. Item difficulty,, discrimination,, and fit were reported. Item-category characteristic curves (ICCs) and item and test information curves were used to graphically assess the validity and reliability based on the IRT analysis. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to check for possible item bias on gender and age.
33284123#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 574 respondents from 5 cities in China completed the SC-eHEALS. CFA confirmed that the one-factor model was acceptable. The internal consistency reliability was good,, with a=0.96,, ?=0.92,, and ?=0.96. The item-total correlation coefficients ranged between 0.86 and 0.91. Items 8 and 4 showed the lowest and highest mean scores,, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the SC-eHEALS and ICECAP-A items and overall health status were significant,, but the strength was mild. The discrimination of SC-eHEALS items ranged between 2.63 and 5.42. ICCs indicated that the order of categories' thresholds for all items was as expected. In total,, 70% of the information provided by SC-eHEALS was below the average level of the latent trait. DIF was found for item 6 on age.
33284123#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The SC-eHEALS has been demonstrated to have good psychometric properties and can therefore be used to evaluate people's eHealth literacy in China.

36394252#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#Prospective observational multicentre study to assess the diagnostic validity and inter- and intraobserver agreement between nurses in peristomal skin lesions. Data were collected between March and October 2019.
36394252#ABSTRACT#SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS#The research sample consisted of a group of 39 nurses with expertise in the care of ostomates.
36394252#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A panel of experts established a list of 24 common signs/findings,, 15 diagnostic options and 35 treatment approaches for peristomal skin lesions. Three expert stoma therapy nurses compiled the clinical cases,, which they described thoroughly and documented with photographs. The 39 participating nurses evaluated the cases in two rounds to measure inter and intraobserver agreement.
36394252#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A high or very high level of agreement (??>?0.61) was observed for the following signs: encrustation,, nodules,, mucocutaneous separation and varicose veins; for the following diagnoses: mucocutaneous dehiscence,, allergic contact dermatitis,, encrustation and varicose veins (caput medusae); for the following treatments: recommending a diet rich in vitamin C/blueberries,, applying acetic acid dressings,, applying cold and topical tacrolimus treatment.
36394252#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The most easily identifiable lesions were those most prevalent and with visible signs. There was a lower level of agreement in identifying lesions for which photographs required additional information (laboratory data,, description of signs and symptoms,, type of diet and level of self-care). It is important to train nurses caring for ostomates to correctly describe ostomy-related lesions,, which is important for nursing records,, continuity of care and telehealth care.

37095892#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Development of the evaluation framework was informed by a systematic scoping review and health informatics literature. Specifically,, the framework drew upon critical appraisal and concept mapping of the TAM,, ISS and HOT-fit validated models,, with respect to health ICT in contemporary pharmacy practice.
37095892#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The proposed model was named the Technology Evaluation Key (TEK). The TEK comprises of 10 domains; healthcare system,, organization,, practitioner,, user interface,, ICT,, use,, operational outcomes,, system outcomes,, clinical outcomes and timely access to care.
37095892#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This is the first published proposed evaluation framework developed for health ICT specifically in contemporary pharmacy practice. TEK represents a pragmatic way to ensure the development,, refinement and implementation of new and existing technologies in contemporary pharmacy practice to keep pace with the clinical and professional requirements of community pharmacists. Operational,, clinical and system outcomes should be evaluated as coexisting factors that may impact implementation. Validation research utilizing Design Science Research Methodology will enhance utility for end users and ensure the relevance and application of the TEK to contemporary pharmacy practice.
17958938#ABSTRACT##We have developed a telemedicine system for blood transfusion work,, to supply the local hospital laboratory with an expert opinion from the central reference laboratory. The telemedicine system allows remote inspection and interpretation of pre-transfusion tests,, which are performed by ID-cards (micro-tube gel technology). The system was installed at three blood transfusion laboratories in Slovenia,, approximately 70 km apart. Validation of the telemedicine system was performed using 99 clinical cases selected randomly from routine work. Two groups of immunohaematology specialists participated. Group A (n = 8) performed the read-out of the pre-transfusion tests on ID-cards by using the telemedicine system. Group B (n = 2) then read the ID-cards independently using the standard visual method. All 98 final interpretations which were recorded using the telemedicine system were correct. We recorded 591 micro-tube read-outs of agglutination strength using the telemedicine system,, of which 582 were correct. For comparison,, we recorded 591 micro-tube read-outs using the standard visual method,, of which 582 were correct. The validation proved that the telemedicine system was suitable for operational use.

16929036#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data sources included TSUQ,, utilization data from IDEATel log files,, and sociodemographic data from the annual IDEATel interview. Psychometric analyses were conducted to examine the reliability and validity of TSUQ. Data were analyzed using descriptive,, correlational techniques.
16929036#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The principal components factor analysis extracted two factors (Video Visits,, alpha=.96,, and Use and Impact,, alpha=.92) that explained 63.6% of the variance in TSUQ satisfaction scores. All satisfaction and usefulness items had mean scores of greater than 4 on a 5-point scale. Those from urban areas reported significantly higher ratings on both factors than rural participants as did those who did not know how to use a computer at baseline. Mean frequency of utilization of IDEATel components was highest for blood sugar testing followed by web site for reviewing results,, blood pressure testing,, video visits,, and ADA educational Web pages. Associations between utilization and perceptions of satisfaction and usefulness varied among IDEATel components.
16929036#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Psychometric analyses support the construct validity and internal consistency reliability of TSUQ,, which is available in both English and Spanish at a readability level of 8th grade. Both rural and urban participants reported high levels of satisfaction and found all IDEATel components useful. Further work is needed to examine the relationships between utilization and perceptions of satisfaction and usefulness and to explore the effects of location (urban versus rural) and ethnicity on satisfaction with telemedicine services.

25600815#ABSTRACT##Smartphone health applications ('apps') are widely available but experts remain cautious about their utility and safety. We reviewed currently available apps for the detection of melanoma (July 2014),, aimed at general community,, patient and generalist clinician users. A proforma was used to extract and assess each app that met the inclusion criteria,, and we undertook content analysis to evaluate their content and the evidence applied in their development. Thirty-nine apps were identified with the majority available only for Apple users. Over half (n = 22) provided information or education about melanoma,, ultraviolet radiation exposure prevention advice,, and skin self-examination strategies,, mainly using the ABCDE (A,, Asymmetry; B,, Border; C,, Colour; D,, Diameter; E,, Evolving) method. Half (n = 19) helped users take and store images of their skin lesions either for review by a dermatologist or for self-monitoring to identify change,, an important predictor of melanoma; a similar number (n = 18) used reminders to help users monitor their skin lesions. A few (n = 9) offered expert review of images. Four apps provided a risk assessment to patients about the probability that a lesion was malignant or benign,, and one app calculated users' future risk of melanoma. None of the apps appeared to have been validated for diagnostic accuracy or utility using established research methods. Smartphone apps for detecting melanoma by nonspecialist users have a range of functions including information,, education,, classification,, risk assessment and monitoring change. Despite their potential usefulness,, and while clinicians may choose to use apps that provide information to educate their patients,, apps for melanoma detection require further validation of their utility and safety.
35617008#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The successful rehabilitation of musculoskeletal pain requires more than medical input alone. Conservative treatment,, including physiotherapy and exercise therapy,, can be an effective way of decreasing pain associated with musculoskeletal pain. However,, face-to-face appointments are currently not feasible. New mobile technologies,, such as mobile health technologies in the form of an app for smartphones,, can be a solution to this problem. In many cases,, these apps are not backed by scientific literature. Therefore,, it is important that they are reviewed and quality assessed.
35617008#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim is to evaluate and measure the quality of apps related to shoulder pain by using the Mobile App Rating Scale.
35617008#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study included 25 free and paid apps-8 from the Apple Store and 17 from the Google Play Store. A total of 5 reviewers were involved in the evaluation process. A descriptive analysis of the Mobile App Rating Scale results provided a general overview of the quality of the apps.
35617008#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, app quality was generally low,, with an average star rating of 1.97 out of 5. The best scores were in the "Functionality" and "Aesthetics" sections,, and apps were scored poorer in the "Engagement" and "Information" sections. The apps were also rated poorly in the "Subjective Quality" section.

35617008#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In general,, the apps were well built technically and were aesthetically pleasing. However,, the apps failed to provide quality information to users,, which resulted in a lack of engagement. Most of the apps were not backed by scientific literature (24/25,, 96%),, and those that contained scientific references were vastly out-of-date. Future apps would need to address these concerns while taking simple measures to ensure quality control.

29258977#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical and psychological symptoms are common during chemotherapy in cancer patients,, and real-time monitoring of these symptoms can improve patient outcomes. Sensors embedded in mobile phones and wearable activity trackers could be potentially useful in monitoring symptoms passively,, with minimal patient burden.
29258977#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to explore whether passively sensed mobile phone and Fitbit data could be used to estimate daily symptom burden during chemotherapy.
29258977#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Across 295 days of data with both symptom and sensor data,, a number of mobile phone and Fitbit features were correlated with patient-reported symptom burden scores. We achieved an accuracy of 88.1% for our population model. The subset of features with the best accuracy included sedentary behavior as the most frequent activity,, fewer minutes in light physical activity,, less variable and average acceleration of the phone,, and longer screen-on time and interactions with apps on the phone. Mobile phone features had better predictive ability than Fitbit features. Accuracy of individual models ranged from 78.1% to 100% (mean 88.4%),, and subsets of relevant features varied across participants.
29258977#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Passive sensor data,, including mobile phone accelerometer and usage and Fitbit-assessed activity and sleep,, were related to daily symptom burden during chemotherapy. These findings highlight opportunities for long-term monitoring of cancer patients during chemotherapy with minimal patient burden as well as real-time adaptive interventions aimed at early management of worsening or severe symptoms.

29258977#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 14 patients undergoing chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancer participated in the 4-week study. Participants carried an Android phone and wore a Fitbit device for the duration of the study and also completed daily severity ratings of 12 common symptoms. Symptom severity ratings were summed to create a total symptom burden score for each day,, and ratings were centered on individual patient means and categorized into low,, average,, and high symptom burden days. Day-level features were extracted from raw mobile phone sensor and Fitbit data and included features reflecting mobility and activity,, sleep,, phone usage (eg,, duration of interaction with phone and apps),, and communication (eg,, number of incoming and outgoing calls and messages). We used a rotation random forests classifier with cross-validation and resampling with replacement to evaluate population and individual model performance and correlation-based feature subset selection to select nonredundant features with the best predictive ability.

26938673#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#This study investigates the accuracy of a heart rate (HR) measurement algorithm applied to a pulse wave. This was based on video signals recorded with a smartphone. The results of electrocardiographic HR and standard linear heart rate variability (HRV) analysis were used for reference.
26938673#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#On a total of 68 subjects,, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and the pulse curve were simultaneously recorded on an Apple iPhone 4S. The HR was measured using an algorithm developed by the authors that works according to a method combining the detection of the steepest slope of every pulse wave with the correlation to an optimized pulse wave pattern.
26938673#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results of the HR measured by pulse curves were extremely consistent (R?>?0.99) with the HR measured on ECGs. For most standard linear HRV parameters as well,, high correlations of R?=?0.90 in the analysis were achieved in the time and frequency domain.
26938673#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In conclusion,, the overall accuracy of HR and HRV indices of pulse wave analysis,, based on video signals of a smartphone,, with the developed algorithm was sufficient for preclinical screening applications.

36904261#ABSTRACT##Predictors of healthy eating parameters,, including the Healthy Eating Index (HEI),, Glycemic Index (GI),, and Glycemic Load (GL),, were examined using various modern diets (n = 131) in preparation for personalized nutrition in the e-health era. Using Nutrition Data Systems for Research computerized software and artificial intelligence machine-learning-based predictive validation analyses,, we included domains of HEI,, caloric source,, and various diets as the potentially modifiable factors. HEI predictors included whole fruits and whole grains,, and empty calories. Carbohydrates were the common predictor for both GI and GL,, with total fruits and Mexican diets being additional predictors for GI. The median amount of carbohydrates to reach an acceptable GL < 20 was predicted as 33.95 g per meal (median: 3.59 meals daily) with a regression coefficient of 37.33 across all daily diets. Diets with greater carbohydrates and more meals needed to reach acceptable GL < 20 included smoothies,, convenient diets,, and liquids. Mexican diets were the common predictor for GI and carbohydrates per meal to reach acceptable GL < 20; with smoothies (12.04),, high-school (5.75),, fast-food (4.48),, Korean (4.30),, Chinese (3.93),, and liquid diets (3.71) presenting a higher median number of meals. These findings could be used to manage diets for various populations in the precision-based e-health era.

34862297#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Epilepsy is a chronic condition requiring consistent follow-up aimed at seizure control,, and monitoring of anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and side effects. Telemedicine (TM) offers invaluable support to patient follow-up,, guaranteeing the prompt availability of a team of experts for persons with epilepsy (PWE) widely distributed across the country. Although many health institutions have endorsed the use of TM,, robust data on effectiveness,, safety and costs of TM applied to epilepsy are lacking. TELEmedicine for EPIlepsy Care (TELE-EPIC) will evaluate the effectiveness of video consultation (VC) via TM compared with usual care (UC) for the monitoring of PWE (TELE-EPIC_RCT). Moreover,, TELE-EPIC will apply an innovative Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling (VAMS) device for quantitation of ASM through finger prick blood sampling as an alternative to venipuncture sampling (TELE-EPIC_VAMS).
34862297#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS#TELE-EPIC_RCT is a multicentre,, open,, pragmatic two-arm randomised controlled trial prospectively including adult and paediatric outpatients with established diagnosis of epilepsy consecutively attending the Epilepsy Centres of Bologna and Rome,, respectively. The primary outcome is the non-inferiority of VC on seizure control compared with UC after an 18-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are adherence to treatment,, ASM-related adverse events,, quality of life,, mood disorders,, patient and caregiver satisfaction,, safety and costs. TELE-EPIC_VAMS is a cross-validation study for blood ASM quantitation through a novel,, VAMS-based device,, comparing (1) VAMS versus plasma samples (reference standard method); and (2) nurse-collected versus self-collected blood by VAMS device.
34862297#ABSTRACT#ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION#The study has been approved by the local ethics committee (349-2019-SPER-AUSLBO). Complete information about the state of project,, relevant events and results will be regularly updated on the project's webpage on ClinicalTrials.gov. The project's results and data on the potential impact of TM in epilepsy will be disseminated on social media. A closeout meeting will be convened for the communication and dissemination of the project,, highlighting its main achievements and impacts.

30781647#ABSTRACT##The emerging demographic trends toward an aging population,, demand new ways and solutions to improve the quality of elderly life. These include,, prolonged independent living,, improved health care,, and reduced social isolation. Recent technological advances in the field of assistive robotics bring higher sophistication and various assistive abilities that can help in achieving these goals. In this paper,, we present design and validation of a low-cost telepresence robot that can assist the elderly and their professional caregivers,, in everyday activities. The developed robot structure and its control objectives were tested in,, both,, a simulation and experimental environment. On-field experiments were done in a private elderly care center involving elderly persons and caregivers as participants. The goal of the evaluation study was to test the software architecture and the robot capabilities for navigation,, as well as the robot manipulator. Moreover,, participants' reactions toward a possible adoption of the developed robot system in everyday activities were assessed. The obtained results of the conducted evaluation study are also presented and discussed.

26809367#ABSTRACT##Despite the increasing use of E-health systems for mental-health organizations,, there is a lack of psychometric tools to evaluate their acceptability by patients with mental disorders. Thus,, this study aimed to translate and validate a French version of the Acceptability E-scale (AES),, a 6-item self-reported questionnaire that evaluates the extent to which patients find E-health systems acceptable. A forward-backward translation of the AES was performed. The psychometric properties of the French AES version,, with construct validity,, internal structural validity and external validity (Pearson's coefficient between AES scores and depression symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory II) were analyzed. In a sample of 178 patients (mean age=46.51 years,, SD=12.91 years),, the validation process revealed satisfactory psychometric properties: factor analysis revealed two factors: "Satisfaction" (3 items) and "Usability" (3 items) and Cronbach's alpha was 0.7. No significant relation was found between AES scores and depression symptoms. The French version of the AES revealed a two-factor scale that differs from the original version. In line with the importance of acceptability in mental health and with a view to E-health systems for patients with mental disorders,, the use of the AES in psychiatry may provide important information on acceptability (i.e.,, satisfaction and usability).

34283889#ABSTRACT##A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper,, we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected,, anonymized health data submitted by 4,,088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20,, stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework,, we concluded that 29% of women were in the "Preparation" stage,, 21% were in the "Contemplation" stage,, and 50% were in the "Pre-Contemplation" stage. We demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict future healthcare-seeking behavior based on information learned during the initial encounter. Models like this may help intervention developers to tailor strategies and content in real-time.
26433889#ABSTRACT##In the last few years,, numerous remote user authentication and session key agreement schemes have been put forwarded for Telecare Medical Information System,, where the patient and medical server exchange medical information using Internet. We have found that most of the schemes are not usable for practical applications due to known security weaknesses. It is also worth to note that unrestricted number of patients login to the single medical server across the globe. Therefore,, the computation and maintenance overhead would be high and the server may fail to provide services. In this article,, we have designed a medical system architecture and a standard mutual authentication scheme for single medical server,, where the patient can securely exchange medical data with the doctor(s) via trusted central medical server over any insecure network. We then explored the security of the scheme with its resilience to attacks. Moreover,, we formally validated the proposed scheme through the simulation using Automated Validation of Internet Security Schemes and Applications software whose outcomes confirm that the scheme is protected against active and passive attacks. The performance comparison demonstrated that the proposed scheme has lower communication cost than the existing schemes in literature. In addition,, the computation cost of the proposed scheme is nearly equal to the exiting schemes. The proposed scheme not only efficient in terms of different security attacks,, but it also provides an efficient login,, mutual authentication,, session key agreement and verification and password update phases along with password recovery.

27224997#ABSTRACT##Introduction Telehealth (TH) is a potential solution to the increased incidence of chronic illness in an ageing population. The extent to which older people and users with chronic conditions accept and adhere to using assistive technologies is a potential barrier to mainstreaming the service. This study reports the development and validation of the Whole Systems Demonstrator (WSD) Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ). Methods Questionnaires measuring the acceptability of TH,, quality of life,, well-being and psychological processes were completed by 478 users of TH. The 22 acceptability items were subject to principal components analysis (PCA) to determine sub-scales. Scale scores,, relationships between scales and other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs),, and group differences on scales were utilised to check the reliability and validity of the measure. Results PCAs of SUTAQ items produced six TH acceptability scales: enhanced care,, increased accessibility,, privacy and discomfort,, care personnel concerns,, kit as substitution and satisfaction. Significant correlations within these beliefs and between these scales and additional PROMs were coherent,, and the SUTAQ sub-scales were able to predict those more likely to refuse TH. Discussion The SUTAQ is an instrument that can be used to measure user beliefs about the acceptability of TH,, and has the ability to discriminate between groups and predict individual differences in beliefs and behaviour. Measuring acceptability beliefs of TH users can provide valuable information to direct and target provision of services to increase uptake and maintain use of TH.

21095645#ABSTRACT##Current methods for assessing the efficacy of treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on physician rated scores. These methods pose three major shortcomings: 1) the subjectivity of the assessments,, 2) the lack of precision on the rating scale (6 discrete levels),, and 3) the inability to assess symptoms except under very specific conditions and/or for very specific tasks. To address these shortcomings,, a portable system was developed to continuously monitor Parkinsonian symptoms with quantitative measures based on electrical signals from muscle activity (EMG). Here,, we present the system design and the implementation of methods for system validation. This system was designed to provide continuous measures of tremor,, rigidity,, and bradykinesia which are related to the neurophysiological source without the need for multiple bulky experimental apparatuses,, thus allowing more precise,, quantitative indicators of the symptoms which can be measured during practical daily living tasks. This measurement system has the potential to improve the diagnosis of PD as well as the evaluation of PD treatments,, which is an important step in the path to improving PD treatments.
30239594#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Twenty H&E-stained frozen section slides,, prepared after tissue inking with five stain combinations,, were assessed by three pathologists using LM,, TM,, and VM. TM was performed using Mikroscan D2 slide scanner/LiveQ software with various objectives. VM was performed using Mikroscan D2 scanner/Qumulus software,, specimens digitized at20×.
30239594#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Sensitivity/specificity by LM was 100%/100% for all colors. TM showed high overall specificity but poor sensitivity,, particularly red (54%). VM showed high specificity for all colors except black (69%) and,, consequently,, poor sensitivity for all colors except black (96%).
30239594#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#TMD identification via telepathology showed loss of sensitivity/specificity vs LM and highlighted the need for caution when interpreting TMDs with digital technologies and the need for validation protocols.

33983130#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic research of smoking cessation apps was conducted in both the Google Play Store and Apple Store in the French market. The general quality of popular apps was rated with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),, and the therapeutic quality was assessed with the ratio of adherence of the behavior change technique taxonomy for smoking cessation treatment.
33983130#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 14 mobile apps met all the inclusion criteria of the content analysis. The interrater reliability varied from "substantial" (0.79) to "almost perfect" (0.9) for the two measures. The mean MARS score was 3.5 out of 5 (median 3.6,, IQR 0.6 [3.2-3.8]). The findings suggest that popular apps focus primarily on the functionality dimension of the MARS scale (4.2/5). The mean number of BCTs was 22,, with a large difference between apps (minimum 4,, maximum 38). At least half of the apps addressed motivation (8.8/14,, 63%) and advised on using behavioral skills in order to quit smoking or stay a nonsmoker (8.7/14,, 62%). However,, only a handful of apps gathered important information (5.9/14,, 42%) in order to deliver proper advice regarding the use of approved medication or the implementation of behavioral techniques (4.3/14,, 31%). The mean MARS score was positively correlated with the price (r=0.70,, P=.007) and the number of BCTs used (r=0.67,, P=.01). User rating was not correlated with any quality scale (P=.67).
33983130#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The content quality of popular smoking cessation apps in France varied by app type and price. Most popular apps propose in general good quality content but lack implementation of evidence-based BCTs associated with effectiveness on smoking cessation treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate the improvement in the content quality of smoking cessation apps in France.

28394662#ABSTRACT##Walking speed is an important indicator of worsening in a variety of neurological and neuromuscular diseases,, yet typically is measured only infrequently and in a clinical setting. Passive measurement of walking speed at home could provide valuable information to track the progression of many neuromuscular conditions. The purpose of this study was to validate the measurement of walking speed by a shelf-top ambient measurement system (AMS) that can be placed in a patient's home. Twenty-eight healthy adults (16 male,, 12 female) were asked to walk three pre-defined routes two times each (total of 168 traversals). For each traversal,, walking speed was measured simultaneously by five sources: two independent AMSs and three human timers with stopwatches. Measurements across the five sources were compared by generalised estimating equations (GEE). Correlation coefficients compared pairwise for walking speeds across the two AMSs,, three human timers,, and three routes all exceeded 0.86 (p?<?.0001),, and for AMS-to-AMS exceeded 0.92 (p?<?.0001). Aggregated across all routes,, there was no significant difference in measured walking speeds between the two AMSs (p?=?.596). There was a statistically significant difference between the AMSs and human timers of 8.5?cm/s (p?<?.0001),, which is comparable to differences reported for other non-worn sensors. The tested AMS demonstrated the ability to automatically measure walking speeds comparable to manual observation and recording,, which is the current standard for assessing walking speed in a clinical setting. The AMS may be used to detect changes in walking speed in community settings.

31392247#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The BRadykinesia Akinesia INcoordination (BRAIN) tap test is an online keyboard tapping task that has been previously validated to assess upper limb motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD).
31392247#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To develop a new parameter that detects a sequence effect and to reliably distinguish between PD patients on and off medication. In addition,, we sought to validate a mobile version of the test for use on smartphones and tablet devices.
31392247#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The BRAIN test scores in 61 patients with PD and 93 healthy controls were compared. A range of established parameters captured number and accuracy of alternate taps. The new velocity score recorded the intertap speed. Decrement in the velocity score was used as a marker for the sequence effect. In the validation phase,, 19 PD patients and 19 controls were tested using different hardware including mobile devices.
31392247#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Quantified slopes from the velocity score demonstrated bradykinesia (sequence effect) in PD patients (slope cut-off -0.002) with 58% sensitivity and 81% specificity (discovery phase of the study) and 65% sensitivity and 88% specificity (validation phase). All BRAIN test parameters differentiated between on and off medication states in PD. Differentiation between PD patients and controls was possible on all hardware versions of the test.

32735226#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In recent years,, there has been an exponential growth of mobile health (mHealth)-related apps. This has occurred in a somewhat unsupervised manner. Therefore,, having a set of criteria that could be used by all stakeholders to guide the development process and the assessment of the quality of the apps is of most importance.
32735226#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper is to study the validity of the Mobile App Development and Assessment Guide (MAG),, a guide recently created to help stakeholders develop and assess mobile health apps.
32735226#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To conduct a validation process of the MAG,, we used the Delphi method to reach a consensus among participating stakeholders. We identified 158 potential participants: 45 patients as potential end users,, 41 health care professionals,, and 72 developers. We sent participants an online survey and asked them to rate how important they considered each item in the guide to be on a scale from 0 to 10. Two rounds were enough to reach consensus.
32735226#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the first round,, almost one-third (n=42) of those invited participated,, and half of those (n=24) also participated in the second round. Most items in the guide were found to be important to a quality mHealth-related app; a total of 48 criteria were established as important. "Privacy,," "security,," and "usability" were the categories that included most of the important criteria.
32735226#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The data supports the validity of the MAG. In addition,, the findings identified the criteria that stakeholders consider to be most important. The MAG will help advance the field by providing developers,, health care professionals,, and end users with a valid guide so that they can develop and identify mHealth-related apps that are of quality.

27471996#ABSTRACT##Many of the demands to perform next generation sequencing (NGS) in the clinical laboratory can be resolved using the principles of telepathology. Molecular telepathology can allow facilities to outsource all or a portion of their NGS operation such as cloud computing,, bioinformatics pipelines,, variant data management,, and knowledge curation. Clinical pathology laboratories can electronically share diverse types of molecular data with reference laboratories,, technology service providers,, and/or regulatory agencies. Exchange of electronic molecular data allows laboratories to perform validation of rare diseases using foreign data,, check the accuracy of their test results against benchmarks,, and leverage in silico proficiency testing. This review covers the emerging subject of molecular telepathology,, describes clinical use cases for the appropriate exchange of molecular data,, and highlights key issues such as data integrity,, interoperable formats for massive genomic datasets,, security,, malpractice and emerging regulations involved with this novel practice.

37067882#ABSTRACT##Demand for digital health interventions is increasing in many countries. The use of recorded mental health recovery narratives in digital health interventions is becoming more widespread in clinical practice. Mental health recovery narratives are first-person lived experience accounts of recovery from mental health problems,, including struggles and successes over time. Helpful impacts of recorded mental health recovery narratives include connectedness with the narrative and validation of experiences. Possible harms include feeling disconnected and excluded from others. Diverse narrative collections from many types of narrators and describing multiple ways to recover are important to maximize the opportunity for service users to benefit through connection and to minimize the likelihood of harm. Mental health clinicians need to know whether narrative collections are sufficiently diverse to recommend to service users. However,, no method exists for assessing the diversity and inclusivity of existing or new narrative collections. We argue that assessing diversity and inclusivity is the next frontier in mental health recovery narrative research and practice. This is important,, but methodologically and ethically complex. In this viewpoint,, we propose and evaluate one diversity and two inclusivity assessment methods. The diversity assessment method involves use of the Simpson Diversity Index. The two inclusivity assessment methods are based on comparator demographic rates and arbitrary thresholds,, respectively. These methods were applied to four narrative collections as a case study. Refinements are needed regarding a narrative assessment tool in terms of its practicality and cultural adaptation.

32218310#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine is both effective and able to provide efficient care at a lower cost. It also enjoys a high degree of acceptance among users. The Technology Acceptance Model proposed is based on the two main concepts of ease of use and perceived usefulness and is comprised of three dimensions: the individual context,, the technological context and the implementation or organizational context. At present,, no short,, validated questionnaire exists in Catalonia to evaluate the acceptance of telemedicine services amongst healthcare professionals using a technology acceptance model. This article aims to statistically validate the Catalan version of the EU project Health Optimum telemedicine acceptance questionnaire. The study included the following phases: adaptation and translation of the questionnaire into Catalan and psychometric validation with construct (exploratory factor analysis),, consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and stability (test-retest) analysis. After deleting incomplete responses,, calculations were made using 33 participants. The internal consistency measured with the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was good with an alpha coefficient of 0.84 (95%,, CI: 0.79-0.84). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.852-0.964). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sampling showed to be adequate (KMO = 0.818) and the Bartlett test of sphericity was significant (Chi-square 424.188; gl = 28; p < 0.001). The questionnaire had two dimensions which accounted for 61.2% of the total variance: quality and technical difficulties relating to telemedicine. The findings of this study suggest that the validated questionnaire has robust statistical features that make it a good predictive model of healthcare professional's satisfaction with telemedicine programs.

33360116#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Determining the key sets of competencies necessary for a Health Informatics (HI) professional to practice effectively either solo or as a member of a multidisciplinary team has been challenging for the regulator and registration body responsible for the healthcare workforce in Saudi Arabia,, which is the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS).
33360116#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop a HI competency framework to guide SCFHS to introduce a HI certification program that meets local healthcare needs and is aligned with the national digital health transformation strategy.
33360116#ABSTRACT#METHODOLOGY#A two-phase mixed methods approach was used in this study. For phase 1,, a scoping review was conducted to identify HI competencies that have been published in the relevant literature. Out of a total 116 articles found relevant,, 20 were included for further analysis. For phase 2,, Saudi HI stakeholders (N = 24) that included HI professionals,, administrators,, academics,, and healthcare professionals were identified and participated in an online survey,, and asked to rank the importance of HI competencies distinguished in phase 1. To further validate and contextualize the competency framework,, multiple focus groups and expert panel meetings were undertaken with the key stakeholders.
35995987#AUTHOR#17#Karnataka Lingayat Education Society's Institute of Dental Sciences,, Bangalore,, India.
33360116#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#For phase 1,, about 1315 competencies were initially extracted from the included studies. After iterative reviews and refinements of codes and themes,, 6 preliminary domains,, 23 sub-domains and 152 competencies were identified. In phase 2,, a total of 24 experts participated in the online surveys and ranked 58 out of 152 competencies as 'very important/required',, each received 75 % or more of votes. The remaining competencies (N = 94) were included in a list for a further discussion in the focus groups. A Total of fourteen HI experts accepted and joined in the focus groups. The multiphase approach resulted in a competency framework that included 92 competencies,, that were grouped into 6 domains and 22 subdomains. The six key domains are: Core Principles; Information and Communication Technology (ICT); Health Sciences; Health Data Analytics; Education and Research; Leadership and Management.
33360116#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The study developed the Saudi Health Informatics Competency Framework (SHICF) that is based on an iterative,, evidence-based approach,, with validation from key stakeholders. Future work should continue the validation,, review,, and development of the framework with continued collaboration from relevant stakeholders representing both the healthcare and educational communities. We anticipate that this work will be expanded and adopted by relative professional and scientific bodies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region.

34267296#ABSTRACT##While digital health solutions continue to grow in number and in complexity,, the ability for stakeholders in healthcare to easily discern quality lags far behind. This challenge is in part due to the lack of a transparent and standardized approach to validation. Evaluation of mobile health applications (apps) is further burdened by low barriers to development and direct-to-user marketing,, leading to a crowded and confusing landscape. In this context,, we investigated the pragmatic application of a previously described framework for digital health validation,, the Digital Health Scorecard,, in a cohort of 22 popular mobile health oncology apps. The apps evaluated using this framework performed poorly,, scoring 49.4% across all evaluation criteria as a group. Performance across component domains varied considerably with cost scoring highest at 100%,, usability at 56.7%,, technical at 37.3%,, and clinical at 15.9%. satisfaction of prospectively determined end-user requirements derived from patient,, family,, and clinician consensus scored 37.2%. While cost outperformed consistently and usability was adequate,, the results also suggested that apps suffered from significant technical limitations,, were of limited clinical value,, and generally did not do what end users wanted. These large gaps further support the need for transparent and standardized evaluation to help all stakeholders in healthcare improve the quality of mobile health.

35463751#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Consumer smartwatches have gained attention as mobile health (mHealth) tools able to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) using photoplethysmography (PPG) or a short strip of electrocardiogram (ECG). PPG has limited accuracy due to the movement artifacts,, whereas ECG cannot be used continuously,, is usually displayed as a single-lead signal and is limited in asymptomatic cases.
35463751#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#DoubleCheck-AF is a validation study of a wrist-worn device dedicated to providing both continuous PPG-based rhythm monitoring and instant 6-lead ECG with no wires. We evaluated its ability to differentiate between AF and sinus rhythm (SR) with particular emphasis on the challenge of frequent premature beats.
35463751#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#We performed a prospective,, non-randomized study of 344 participants including 121 patients in AF. To challenge the specificity of the device two control groups were selected: 95 patients in stable SR and 128 patients in SR with frequent premature ventricular or atrial contractions (PVCs/PACs). All ECG tracings were labeled by two independent diagnosis-blinded cardiologists as "AF,," "SR" or "Cannot be concluded." In case of disagreement,, a third cardiologist was consulted. A simultaneously recorded ECG of Holter monitor served as a reference. It revealed a high burden of ectopy in the corresponding control group: 6.2 PVCs/PACs per minute,, bigeminy/trigeminy episodes in 24.2% (31/128) and runs of =3 beats in 9.4% (12/128) of patients. AF detection with PPG-based algorithm,, ECG of the wearable and combination of both yielded sensitivity and specificity of 94.2 and 96.9%; 99.2 and 99.1%; 94.2 and 99.6%,, respectively. All seven false-positive PPG-based cases were from the frequent PVCs/PACs group compared to none from the stable SR group (P < 0.001). In the majority of these cases (6/7) cardiologists were able to correct the diagnosis to SR with the help of the ECG of the device (P = 0.012).
35463751#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This is the first wearable combining PPG-based AF detection algorithm for screening of AF together with an instant 6-lead ECG with no wires for manual rhythm confirmation. The system maintained high specificity despite a remarkable amount of frequent single or multiple premature contractions.

28752937#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There are no consistent predictors of treatment outcome in paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). One reason for this might be the use of suboptimal statistical methodology. Machine learning is an approach to efficiently analyse complex data. Machine learning has been widely used within other fields,, but has rarely been tested in the prediction of paediatric mental health treatment outcomes.
28752937#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To test four different machine learning methods in the prediction of treatment response in a sample of paediatric OCD patients who had received Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT).
28752937#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants were 61 adolescents (12-17 years) who enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and received ICBT. All clinical baseline variables were used to predict strictly defined treatment response status three months after ICBT. Four machine learning algorithms were implemented. For comparison,, we also employed a traditional logistic regression approach.
28752937#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Multivariate logistic regression could not detect any significant predictors. In contrast,, all four machine learning algorithms performed well in the prediction of treatment response,, with 75 to 83% accuracy.
28752937#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The results suggest that machine learning algorithms can successfully be applied to predict paediatric OCD treatment outcome. Validation studies and studies in other disorders are warranted.

35995987#ABSTRACT##Early detection of oral cancer in low-resource settings necessitates a Point-of-Care screening tool that empowers Frontline-Health-Workers (FHW). This study was conducted to validate the accuracy of Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) enabled m(mobile)-Health device deployed with FHWs for delineation of suspicious oral lesions (malignant/potentially-malignant disorders). The effectiveness of the device was tested in tertiary-care hospitals and low-resource settings in India. The subjects were screened independently,, either by FHWs alone or along with specialists. All the subjects were also remotely evaluated by oral cancer specialist/s. The program screened 5025 subjects (Images: 32,,128) with 95% (n?=?4728) having telediagnosis. Among the 16% (n?=?752) assessed by onsite specialists,, 20% (n?=?102) underwent biopsy. Simple and complex CNN were integrated into the mobile phone and cloud respectively. The onsite specialist diagnosis showed a high sensitivity (94%),, when compared to histology,, while telediagnosis showed high accuracy in comparison with onsite specialists (sensitivity: 95%; specificity: 84%). FHWs,, however,, when compared with telediagnosis,, identified suspicious lesions with less sensitivity (60%). Phone integrated,, CNN (MobileNet) accurately delineated lesions (n?=?1416; sensitivity: 82%) and Cloud-based CNN (VGG19) had higher accuracy (sensitivity: 87%) with tele-diagnosis as reference standard. The results of the study suggest that an automated mHealth-enabled,, dual-image system is a useful triaging tool and empowers FHWs for oral cancer screening in low-resource settings.

29188446#ABSTRACT##Reducing child mortality with quality care is the prime-most concern of all nations. Thus in current IT era,, our healthcare industry needs to focus on adapting information technology in healthcare services. Barring few preliminary attempts to digitalize basic hospital administrative and clinical functions,, even today in India,, child health and vaccination records are still maintained as paper-based records. Also,, error in manually plotting the parameters in growth charts results in missed opportunities for early detection of growth disorders in children. To address these concerns,, we present India's first hospital linked,, affordable automated vaccination and real-time child's growth monitoring cloud based application- Integrated Child Health Record cloud (iCHRcloud). This application is based on HL7 protocol enabling integration with hospital's HIS/EMR system. It provides Java (Enterprise Service Bus and Hibernate) based web portal for doctors and mobile application for parents,, enhancing doctor-parent engagement. It leverages highchart to automate chart preparation and provides access of data via Push Notification (GCM and APNS) to parents on iOS and Android mobile platforms. iCHRcloud has also been recognized as one of the best innovative solution in three nationwide challenges,, 2016 in India. iCHRcloud offers a seamless,, secure (256 bit HTTPS) and sustainable solution to reduce child mortality. Detail analysis on preliminary data of 16,,490 child health records highlight the diversified need of various demographic regions. Thus,, primary lesson would be to implement better validation strategies to fulfill the customize requisites of entire population. This paper presents first glimpse of data and power of the analytics in policy framework.

33777644#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#Opioid misuse,, addiction,, and related harm is a global crisis that affects public health and social and economic welfare. Many of the strategies being used to combat the opioid crisis could benefit from improved access and dissemination,, such as that afforded by smartphone apps. The goal of this study was to characterize the purpose,, audience,, quality and popularity of opioid-related smartphone apps. Using web scraping,, available information from 619 opioid-related apps (e.g.,, popularity metrics) was downloaded from Google Play,, and 59 apps met criteria for review. The apps were additionally coded for quality by two raters using an 8-item screener for the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Model.

33777644#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#Opioid-related apps available for consumers addressed key stakeholders (patients,, providers,, community) and were consistent with strategies to address the opioid crisis (prevention,, treatment,, overdose). However,, there was little evidence that available opioid-related apps meet basic quality standards,, and no relationship was found between app quality and popularity. This review was conducted at the level of consumer decision-making (i.e.,, the app store),, where only a handful of opioid-related apps met quality standards enough to warrant a more detailed evaluation of the app before recommendation for use. Because smartphone apps could be a critical tool to increase access to and utilization of opioid prevention,, treatment,, and recovery services,, further development and testing is sorely needed.

35409753#ABSTRACT##Social media have become mainstream online tools that allow individuals to connect and share information. Such platforms also influence people's health behavior in the way they communicate about personal health,, treatment,, or physicians. Individuals' ability to find and apply online health information on specific health problems can be measured using a valid and reliable instrument,, the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric aspects of the Polish version of this instrument (eHEALS-Pl) among social media users,, which has not been explored so far. We examined the translated version of the eHEALS in a representative sample of Polish social media users (n = 1527). CAWI (computer-assisted web interviews) was a method to collect data. The reliability of the eHEALS-Pl was measured by calculating the Cronbach alpha coefficients and analyzing the principal components. Exploratory factor analysis and hypothesis testing was used to assess the construct validity of the instrument. The internal consistency of the eHEALS-Pl was sufficient: Cronbach alpha = 0.84. The item-to-total correlations ranged from r = 0.514 to 0.666. EFA revealed a single structure explaining 47.42% of the variance,, with high factor loadings of the item ranging from 0.623 to 0.769. Hypothesis testing also supported the validity of eHEALS-Pl. The eHEALS-Pl evaluation supported by social media users reviled its equivalence to the original instrument developed by Norman and Skinner in 2006 and it can be used to measure e-health literacy. Since there is no prior validation of the eHEALS among social media users,, these findings may indicate important directions in evaluating digital skills,, especially in relation to the current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

19163906#ABSTRACT##Smart fabrics and interactive textiles (SFIT) are fibrous structures that are capable of sensing,, actuating,, generating/storing power and/or communicating. Research and development towards wearable textile-based personal systems allowing e.g. health monitoring,, protection & safety,, and healthy lifestyle gained strong interest during the last 10 years. Under the Information and Communication Programme of the European Commission,, a cluster of R&D projects dealing with smart fabrics and interactive textile wearable systems regroup activities along two different and complementary approaches i.e. 'application pull' and 'technology push'. This includes projects aiming at personal health management through integration,, validation,, and use of smart clothing and other networked mobile devices as well as projects targeting the full integration of sensors/actuators,, energy sources,, processing and communication within the clothes to enable personal applications such as protection/safety,, emergency and healthcare. The integration part of the technologies into a real SFIT product is at present stage on the threshold of prototyping and testing. Several issues,, technical as well user-centred,, societal and business,, remain to be solved. The paper presents on going major R&D activities,, identifies gaps and discuss key challenges for the future.

36978033#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In Canada,, virtual health care rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is substantial variability between older adults in terms of digital literacy skills,, which precludes equitable participation of some older adults in virtual care. Little is known about how to measure older adults' electronic health (eHealth) literacy,, which could help healthcare providers to support older adults in accessing virtual care. Our study objective was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of eHealth literacy tools in older adults.
36978033#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We completed a systematic review examining the validity of eHealth literacy tools compared to a reference standard or another tool. We searched MEDLINE,, EMBASE,, CENTRAL/CDSR,, PsycINFO and grey literature for articles published from inception until January 13,, 2021. We included studies where the mean population age was at least 60 years old. Two reviewers independently completed article screening,, data abstraction,, and risk of bias assessment using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We implemented the PROGRESS-Plus framework to describe the reporting of social determinants of health.
36978033#ABSTRACT#PROTOCOL REGISTRATION#We registered our systematic review of the literature a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42021238365).
36978033#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We found two tools to support clinicians in identifying older adults' eHealth literacy. However,, given the shortcomings highlighted in the validation of eHealth literacy tools in older adults,, future primary research describing the diagnostic accuracy of tools for measuring eHealth literacy in this population and how social determinants of health impact the assessment of eHealth literacy is needed to strengthen tool implementation in clinical practice.

32898686#ABSTRACT##The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI),, 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT),, creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy,, retinopathy of prematurity,, age-related macular degeneration,, glaucoma,, refractive error correction,, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic,, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a "new normal",, the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally,, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered,, as well as recommendations on future directions.

25014008#ABSTRACT##While the importance of mHealth scale-up has been broadly emphasized in the mHealth community,, it is necessary to guide scale up efforts and investment in ways to help achieve the mortality reduction targets set by global calls to action such as the Millennium Development Goals,, not merely to expand programs. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST)--an evidence-based modeling software--to identify priority areas for maternal and neonatal health services,, by formulating six individual and combined interventions scenarios for two countries,, Bangladesh and Uganda. Our findings show that skilled birth attendance and increased facility delivery as targets for mHealth strategies are likely to provide the biggest mortality impact relative to other intervention scenarios. Although further validation of this model is desirable,, tools such as LiST can help us leverage the benefit of mHealth by articulating the most appropriate delivery points in the continuum of care to save lives.

34255685#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health services are gradually being introduced to support patients' self-management of chronic conditions. The success of these services is contingent upon patients' continuous use of them.
34255685#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to develop a model to measure the success of patients' continuous use of mobile health services for the self-management of chronic conditions.
34255685#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The proposed model was derived from the information systems continuance model and the information systems success model. This model contains 7 theoretical constructs: information quality,, system quality,, service quality,, perceived usefulness,, user satisfaction,, perceived health status,, and continuous use intention. A web-based questionnaire survey instrument was developed to test the model. The survey was conducted to collect data from 129 patients who used a mobile health app for hypertension management from 2017 to 2019. The questionnaire items were derived from validated instruments and were measured using a 5-point Likert scale. The partial least squares modelling method was used to test the theoretical model.

34255685#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=0.414). The continuous use intention was significantly influenced by their perceived health status (ß=.195,, P=.03),, perceived usefulness (ß=.307,, P=.004),, and user satisfaction (ß=.254,, P=.04) with the mobile health service. Information quality (ß=.235,, P=.005),, system quality (ß=.192,, P=.02),, and service quality (ß=.494,, P<.001) had a significantly positive influence on perceived usefulness but not on user satisfaction. Perceived usefulness had a significantly positive influence on user satisfaction (ß=.664,, P<.001). In a result opposite to the original hypothesis,, perceived health status did not negatively influence patients' intention to continue using the mobile health service but showed a significantly positive correlation.
34255685#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study developed a theoretical model to predict and explain patients' continuous use of mobile health services for self-management of chronic conditions and empirically tested the model. Perceived usefulness,, user satisfaction,, and health status contributed to patients' intention to make continuous use of mobile health services for self-managing their chronic conditions.

33511392#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Glass slides from clinically reported cases from 5 participating pathologists with a preset washout period were digitally scanned and reviewed in settings identical to typical reporting. Cases were classified as concordant or with minor or major disagreement with the original diagnosis. Randomized subsampling was performed,, and mean concordance rates were calculated.
33511392#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 171 cases were included and distributed equally among participants. For the group as a whole,, the mean concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 90) was 83.6% counting all discrepancies and 94.6% counting only major disagreements. The mean pathologist concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 18) ranged from 90.49% to 97%.
33511392#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We describe a novel double-blinded method for rapid validation of WSI for primary diagnosis. Our findings highlight the occurrence of a range of diagnostic reproducibility when deploying digital methods.

34388405#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#Telestroke consultations enable hospital providers to administer intravenous (IV) alteplase to patients who would otherwise not receive it due to lack of an in-hospital stroke team. However,, up to 30% of acute stroke patient evaluations are deemed to be stroke mimics. Mimics present a challenge with the limitations of a virtual neurological exam. The administration of IV alteplase in these patients is not without risk. With the cost and risk associated with IV alteplase,, there are both ethical and practical incentives to avoid administering alteplase to a patient manifesting a stroke-mimic. Recently a retrospective analysis validated a TeleStroke Mimic Score (TM-Score) to help detect stroke mimics. We retrospectively applied this tool to Mayo Clinic Stroke Telemedicine for Arizona Rural Residents (STARR) telestroke database to provide external validation in an independent study population.
34388405#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#We analyzed 339 patients in the STARR database for validation of the TM-Score,, which was applied retrospectively to determine whether it predicted stroke-mimic,, using data available during each patient's telestroke consult. We assessed the TM-Score's performance with a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A scatter plot of the data was assembled to demonstrate the relationship between the TM-Score and the likelihood of having a stroke mimic,, and was compared to the nomogram in the original TM-Score study.

34388405#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#When the TM-Score was applied to Mayo Clinic STARR validation cohort,, the area under the ROC curve was 0.78,, larger than that of the derivation cohort in the original study (0.75). Further analysis suggested that a TM-Score > 25 or < 10 provided a greater degree of confidence that the patient had presented with stroke or stroke mimic,, respectively.  In STARR cohort,, additional variables were significantly different between stroke and stroke mimic populations,, including a history of sleep apnea and diabetes.
34388405#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We determined that the original TM-Score was valid when applied to Mayo Clinic STARR telestroke population.

19497726#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#At variance from office spirometry,, telespirometry has not been tested as a tool for improving the ability of general practitioners (GPs) to manage chronic airway diseases.
19497726#ABSTRACT#METHODS#After adequate training,, 937 Italian GPs agreed to perform telespirometry in subjects attending their clinics who had risk factors,, persistent respiratory symptoms,, or a previous diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Each subject performed at least three forced expiratory manoeuvres using a turbine spirometer. Traces were sent by telephone to a Telespirometry Central Office,, where they were interpreted by a pulmonary specialist,, according to defined criteria. The result was sent in real time to the GP to assist the management of the patient.

37145931#ABSTRACT##Introduction. Health care strategies based on information and communication technologies (ICTs) may perpetuate health inequity,, especially among vulnerable populations. In our setting,, there are few validated tools to assess access to ICTs in pediatrics. Objectives. To develop and validate a questionnaire to assess ICT access among caregivers of pediatric patients. To describe the characteristics of ICT access and assess whether there is a correlation among the three levels of the digital divide. Population and methods. We developed and validated a questionnaire and then administered it to the caregivers of children aged 0-12 years. The outcome variables were the questions in the three levels of the digital divide. We also assessed sociodemographic variables. Results. We administered the questionnaire to 344 caregivers. Among them,, 93% had their own cell phone and 98.3% had Internet access via a data network; 99.1% communicated via WhatsApp messages; 28% had had a teleconsultation. The correlation among the questions was null or low. Conclusion. The validated questionnaire allowed us to establish that the caregivers of pediatric patients aged 0-12 years mostly own a mobile phone,, access the Internet via a data network,, communicate mainly through WhatsApp,, and obtain few benefits through ICTs. The correlation among the different components of ICT access was low.
19497726#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#During 2 years,, 20,,757 telespirometries were performed,, with a mean of 22.2+/-25.2 examinations for each GP. 70% of the tests met the criteria for good or partial co-operation,, allowing spirometric abnormalities to be detected in more than 40% of the tracings. The rate of telespirometries that could not be evaluated at all was reasonably low (9.2%). For a subset of the telespirometries,, a comparison between acceptability criteria for telespirometry and those recommended for laboratory (ATS) or office spirometry showed that the majority of telespirometries with good co-operation satisfied completely,, or with minor deviations,, the ATS and Office criteria.
19497726#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Telespirometry was well accepted by Italian GPs,, who obtained acceptable screening traces in a large percentage of subjects. Therefore it might be considered a useful alternative to office spirometry in improving the management of chronic airway diseases by GPs.

34776185#ABSTRACT#METHOD#An observational study in a university laboratory with 34 individuals with idiopathic PD. The number of steps was measured using mHealth devices (Google Fit,, Health,, STEPZ,, Pacer,, and Fitbit INC®),, and compared against a criterionstandard measure during the Two-Minute Walk Test using habitual speed.
34776185#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our sample was 82% men with a Hoehn and Yahr mean of 2.3 ± 1.3 and mean walking speed of 1.2 ± 0.2 m/s. Positive and statistically significant associations were found between Google Fit (r = 0.92; p < 0.01),, STEPZ (r = 0.91; p < 0.01),, Pacer (r = 0.77; p < 0.01),, Health (r = 0.54; p < 0.01),, and Fitbit Inc® (r = 0.82; p < 0.01) with the criterion-standard measure.
34776185#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#GoogleFit,, STEPZ,, Fitbit Inc.®,, Pacer,, and Health are valid instruments to measure the number of steps over a given period of time with moderate to high correlation with the criterion-standard in individuals with PD. This result shows that technology such as smartphone applications and activity monitor can be used to assess the number of steps in individuals with PD,, and allows the possibility of using this technology for assessment and intervention purposes.

31304384#ABSTRACT##Digital health solutions continue to grow in both number and capabilities. Despite these advances,, the confidence of the various stakeholders - from patients and clinicians to payers,, industry and regulators - in medicine remains quite low. As a result,, there is a need for objective,, transparent,, and standards-based evaluation of digital health products that can bring greater clarity to the digital health marketplace. We believe an approach that is guided by end-user requirements and formal assessment across technical,, clinical,, usability,, and cost domains is one possible solution. For digital health solutions to have greater impact,, quality and value must be easier to distinguish. To that end,, we review the existing landscape and gaps,, highlight the evolving responses and approaches,, and detail one pragmatic framework that addresses the current limitations in the marketplace with a path toward implementation.
36069848#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#An anticipated surge in mental health service demand related to COVID-19 has motivated the use of novel methods of care to meet demand,, given workforce limitations. Digital health technologies in the form of self-tracking technology have been identified as a potential avenue,, provided sufficient evidence exists to support their effectiveness in mental health contexts.
36069848#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This literature review aims to identify current and potential physiological or physiologically related monitoring capabilities of the Apple Watch relevant to mental health monitoring and examine the accuracy and validation status of these measures and their implications for mental health treatment.
36069848#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A literature review was conducted from June 2021 to July 2021 of both published and gray literature pertaining to the Apple Watch,, mental health,, and physiology. The literature review identified studies validating the sensor capabilities of the Apple Watch.
36069848#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 5583 paper titles were identified,, with 115 (2.06%) reviewed in full. Of these 115 papers,, 19 (16.5%) were related to Apple Watch validation or comparison studies. Most studies showed that the Apple Watch could measure heart rate acceptably with increased errors in case of movement. Accurate energy expenditure measurements are difficult for most wearables,, with the Apple Watch generally providing the best results compared with peers,, despite overestimation. Heart rate variability measurements were found to have gaps in data but were able to detect mild mental stress. Activity monitoring with step counting showed good agreement,, although wheelchair use was found to be prone to overestimation and poor performance on overground tasks. Atrial fibrillation detection showed mixed results,, in part because of a high inconclusive result rate,, but may be useful for ongoing monitoring. No studies recorded validation of the Sleep app feature; however,, accelerometer-based sleep monitoring showed high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting sleep.
36069848#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The results are encouraging regarding the application of the Apple Watch in mental health,, particularly as heart rate variability is a key indicator of changes in both physical and emotional states. Particular benefits may be derived through avoidance of recall bias and collection of supporting ecological context data. However,, a lack of methodologically robust and replicated evidence of user benefit,, a supportive health economic analysis,, and concerns about personal health information remain key factors that must be addressed to enable broader uptake.

36399862#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Intensive Care Unit Recovery Clinics (ICU-RCs) were founded to address post-intensive care syndrome among ICU survivors. Telemedicine ICU-RCs may facilitate access for more ICU survivors,, however,, patient and caregiver experiences with telemedicine ICU-RCs have not been explored qualitatively.
36399862#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To explore patient and informal caregiver experiences with a telemedicine ICU-RC.
36399862#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Our qualitative exploratory cross-sectional study was guided by qualitative description methodology. Telemedicine ICU-RC visits were conducted at 3- and 12-weeks post-discharge following critical illness. Patients,, and caregivers when available,, met with an ICU pharmacist,, ICU physician,, and a neuropsychologist via Zoom. Thereafter,, we conducted qualitative (1:1) telephone interviews with 14 patients and 12 caregivers recruited purposefully. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
36399862#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Five themes were identified: (1) general impressions of the intervention; (2) intervention organization and delivery; (3) intervention substance; (4) caregiver participation; and (5) ways to improve the intervention. Participants found the telemedicine delivery acceptable,, convenient,, time-saving,, and conducive to thorough discussions. Participants appreciated the information,, reassurance,, and validation. Attention to mental health during the visits was strongly endorsed. Caregiver involvement depended on patient self-management and technical ability. Suggestions included scheduling a 1-week post-discharge visit,, more follow-up visits,, and individualizing content for in-depth discussions,, including mental health evaluation.
36399862#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The study results enhance the understanding of patient and caregiver experiences with a telemedicine ICU-RC. Participants' narratives helped to formulate recommendations to improve telemedicine ICU-RC delivery and content. Acceptability of this intervention indicates the potential for wider implementation of telemedicine ICU-RCs to reach more ICU survivors.

25488232#ABSTRACT##This paper describes an innovative architecture for the remote follow-up of the health of chronic patients,, and its implementation which is called Hygehos Home. The main purpose of the system is to enhance the quality of the daily healthcare practice,, by means of bringing both patient and medical professionals closer to each other and by empowering the patient in the healing process. On the one side,, Hygehos Home is a platform which gives the patient access to a set of personalized e-Health services using different channels such as web or smartphone. The e-Health services currently provided are: a) health related questionnaires,, b) vital sign delivery (weight,, blood pressure,, oxygen level in blood,, temperature,, etc.),, c) pharmacologic treatment adherence follow-up,, d) access to information about the disease,, and e) direct communication with the care providers (physicians,, nurses,, etc.). On the other side,, Hygehos Home is fully integrated in the Hospital Information System (HIS),, so that the healthcare professionals can easily access all data registered by the patients,, such as subjective feedback,, vital signs,, medication uptake,, etc. In this way,, the health professionals are able to conduct an efficient and continuous remote supervision of the evolution of the patient. Finally,, the validation protocol being conducted is described.

27463120#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A myriad of Web-based applications on self-management have been developed,, but few focus on older people. In the face of global aging,, older people form an important target population for cardiovascular prevention. This article describes the full development of an interactive Internet platform for older people,, which was designed for the Healthy Ageing Through Internet Counselling in the Elderly (HATICE) study. We provide recommendations to design senior-friendly Web-based applications for a new approach to multicomponent cardiovascular prevention.
27463120#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The development of the platform followed five phases: (1) conceptual framework; (2) platform concept and functional design; (3) platform building (software and content); (4) testing and pilot study; and (5) final product.
27463120#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We performed a meta-analysis,, reviewed guidelines for cardiovascular diseases,, and consulted end users,, experts,, and software developers to create the platform concept and content. The software was built in iterative cycles. In the pilot study,, 41 people aged =65 years used the platform for 8 weeks. Participants used the interactive features of the platform and appreciated the coach support. During all phases adjustments were made to incorporate all improvements from the previous phases. The final platform is a personal,, secured,, and interactive platform supported by a coach.
27463120#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#When carefully designed,, an interactive Internet platform is acceptable and feasible for use by older people with basic computer skills. To improve acceptability by older people,, we recommend involving the end users in the process of development,, to personalize the platform and to combine the application with human support.

28302638#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#For the optimal management of children with cystic fibrosis,, there are currently no efficient tools for the precise adjustment of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy,, either for advice on appropriate dietary intake or for achieving an optimal nutrition status. Therefore,, we aim to develop a mobile application that ensures a successful nutritional therapy in children with cystic fibrosis.
28302638#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS#A multidisciplinary team of 12 partners coordinate their efforts in 9 work packages that cover the entire so-called 'from laboratory to market' approach by means of an original and innovative co-design process. A cohort of 200 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 1-17 years are enrolled. We will develop an innovative,, clinically tested mobile health application for patients and health professionals involved in cystic fibrosis management. The mobile application integrates the research knowledge and innovative tools for maximising self-management with the aim of leading to a better nutritional status,, quality of life and disease prognosis. Bringing together different and complementary areas of knowledge is fundamental for tackling complex challenges in disease treatment,, such as optimal nutrition and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in cystic fibrosis. Patients are expected to benefit the most from the outcomes of this innovative project.
28302638#ABSTRACT#ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION#The project is approved by the Ethics Committee of the coordinating organisation,, Hospital Universitari La Fe (Ref: 2014/0484). Scientific findings will be disseminated via journals and conferences addressed to clinicians,, food scientists,, information and communications technology experts and patients. The specific dissemination working group within the project will address the wide audience communication through the website (http://www.mycyfapp.eu),, the social networks and the newsletter.

36304535#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Given the rapid innovation of wearable technology,, additional physical indicators can be detected,, and blood pressure (BP) has become the focus of many emerging medical-device manufacturers. This study aimed to validate the accuracy of the newly developed HUAWEI WATCH in BP monitoring,, according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2018) guidelines.
36304535#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The same arm sequential BP measurement was applied. One validation included four reference BP measurements taken simultaneously by two independent observers using a mercury sphygmomanometer,, alternating with three test-watch measurements. Each test-watch measurement was compared against the average of the previous and subsequent reference BP readings. Two criteria were required for validation: (1) a mean BP difference of 5 mm Hg or less,, with a standard deviation (SD) of 8 mm Hg or less for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the 255 pairs of measurements,, and (2) an SD for the of 85 averaged BP differences within the threshold defined by the mean test-reference BP difference listed in the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2018 guidelines.
36304535#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The mean age of the 85 participants was 48 ± 18 years (range: 21-85),, and 53 (62.4%) were male. The mean differences between the test and reference BPs were -0.25 ± 5.62 mm Hg and -1.33 ± 6.81 mm Hg for SBP and DBP,, respectively (according to Criterion 1). The mean differences between the test BPs and reference BPs were -0.25 ± 5.00 mm Hg and -1.33 ± 6.31 mm Hg for SBP and DBP,, respectively,, according to Criterion 2.
36304535#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Blood pressure measurement using the HUAWEI WATCH showed excellent consistency with reference BPs,, and fulfilled both validation criteria of the guidelines,, show its promise as a wearable device for BP self-monitoring.

33414063#ABSTRACT##Patients affected by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) benefit from intensive,, continuous clinical monitoring to guide escalation of treatments that carry the potential to improve survival and quality of life. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,, the need for physical distancing has fueled the expeditious expansion of various telehealth modalities,, which may apply in a unique manner to individuals with PAH. Performance of objective risk assessments in patients with PAH remotely via telemedical visits and other telehealth mechanisms is unprecedented and not yet rigorously validated. The uniquely high risk for rapid deterioration in patients with PAH demands a high degree of sensitivity to detect changes in functional assessments. In this review,, several telehealth modalities for potential utilization in risk assessment and treatment titration in patients with PAH are explored,, yet additional study is needed for their validation with the pre-pandemic care paradigm.

35331980#ABSTRACT##As the pharmacy profession continues to evolve from product oriented to patient centered,, pharmacy programs have been transitioning from a traditional pharmacy curriculum to a competency-based education pedagogy. Competency-based education has been developed to instill the required clinical competencies in graduates to better meet the contemporary role of pharmacists in accordance with the latest scientific knowledge and evidence-based practices in an ever-evolving health care landscape. While these ideas have helped shape the new Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Standards and Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Educational Outcome domains,, recent publications have indicated that it is integral for these Standards to include public health emergency preparedness and response. Updated Standards and Educational Outcomes must be integrated longitudinally in pharmacy curricula to ensure that graduates will be practice-ready health care professionals. This commentary highlights the strategic use of workforce development of population health based on two perspectives: emergency preparedness and response and digital health.

11110635#ABSTRACT##The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) initially established a Commercial Space Center (CSC) in the Department of Surgery at Yale University School of Medicine to further develop and evaluate technologies in information systems,, telecommunications applied to medicine,, and physiologic sensors. The CSC is known as the Medical Informatics and Technology Applications Consortium (MITAC). The overall purpose for this NASA program is to leverage technology,, innovation,, and resources from industry and academia through collaborative partnerships. The Yale-NASA CSC/MITAC organized the Everest Extreme Expeditions (E3) for the spring Himalayan climbing seasons in the years 1998 and 1999. The primary mission was to deliver advanced medical support with global telemedicine capabilities to one of the world's most remote and hostile settings--Mount Everest. The purpose was both humanitarian (providing medical support) and scientific (conducting medical and technology research). The Yale team provided medical care for the Everest Base Camp community; conducted validation experiments for several types of advanced medical technologies in this remote,, hostile environment; and performed real-time monitoring of selected climbers,, while also assessing the basic science of altitude physiology. Additionally,, the teams conducted outreach medical care to the citizens of Nepal and provided several educational forums for a variety of medical and nonmedical personnel--including school-age children. As part of the project's mission,, the E3 medical teams at both Nepal and New Haven were on a 24-hour emergency call system to deliver medical care in the event of a crisis. Unlike most of the teams at Everest,, the mission of E3 was not to climb the 29,,028-foot mountain the Nepalese call Sagarmatha ("Sky Head"). The mountain served as an extreme testing ground for telemedicine. The lessons learned from this testbed are reviewed here and further clarify the abilities to provide better health care in remote and extreme environments--which for some may even be their home environment during/after a medical illness.

26302109#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Diagnosing brain disorders,, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease,, is often difficult,, especially in the early stages. Moreover,, it has been estimated that nearly 40% of people with PD may not be diagnosed. Traditionally,, the diagnosis of neurological disorders,, such as PD,, often required a doctor to observe the patient over time to recognize signs of rigidity in movement.

26302109#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system is a self-contained technique that has been widely used for indoor localization. In this work we propose a PDR-based method to continuously monitor and record the patient's gait characteristics using a smartphone. Seventeen patients were studied over a period of 1 year. During the year it became apparent that 1 of the patients was actually developing PD. To the best of our knowledge,, our work is the first attempt to use sensors in a smartphone to help identify patients in their early stages of neurological disease.
26302109#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#On average,, the accuracy of our step length estimation was about 98%. Using a binary classification method-namely,, support vector machine-we carried out a case study and showed that it was feasible to identify changes in the walking patterns of a PD patient with an accuracy of 94%.
26302109#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using 1 year of gait trace data obtained from the users' phones,, our work provides a first step to experimentally show the possibility of applying smartphone sensor data to provide early warnings to potential PD patients to encourage them to seek medical assistance and thus help doctors diagnose this disease earlier.
22463804#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Robust hardware and software tools have been developed in digital microscopy during the past years for pathologists. Reports have been advocated the reliability of digital slides in routine diagnostics. We have designed a retrospective,, comparative study to evaluate the scanning properties and digital slide based diagnostic accuracy.
22463804#ABSTRACT#METHODS#8 pathologists reevaluated 306 randomly selected cases from our archives. The slides were scanned with a 20× Plan-Apochromat objective,, using a 3-chip Hitachi camera,, resulting 0.465 µm/pixel resolution. Slide management was supported with dedicated Data Base and Viewer software tools. Pathologists used their office PCs for evaluation and reached the digital slides via intranet connection. The diagnostic coherency and uncertainty related to digital slides and scanning quality were analyzed.
22463804#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Good to excellent image quality of slides was recorded in 96%. In half of the critical 61 digital slides,, poor image quality was related to section folds or floatings. In 88.2% of the studied cases the digital diagnoses were in full agreement with the consensus. Out of the overall 36 incoherent cases,, 7 (2.3%) were graded relevant without any recorded uncertainty by the pathologist. Excluding the non-field specific cases from each pathologist's record this ratio was 1.76% of all cases.
22463804#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our results revealed that: 1) digital slide based histopathological diagnoses can be highly coherent with those using optical microscopy; 2) the competency of pathologists is a factor more important than the quality of digital slide; 3) poor digital slide quality do not endanger patient safety as these errors are recognizable by the pathologist and further actions for correction could be taken.

31151321#ABSTRACT##Opioid errors are a leading cause of patient harm. Active failures in opioid dose conversion can contribute to error. Conversion is complex and is currently performed manually using tables of approximate equivalence. Apps that offer opioid dose double-checking are available but there are concerns about their accuracy and clinical validation. This study evaluated a novel opioid dose conversion app,, The Safer Prescription of Opioids Tool (SPOT),, a CE-marked Class I medical device,, as a clinician decision support (CDS) platform. This single-centre prospective clinical utility pilot study followed a mixed methods design. Prescribers completed an initial survey exploring their current opioid prescribing practice. Thereafter prescribers used SPOT for opioid dosage conversions in parallel to their usual clinical practice,, then evaluated SPOT through a survey and focus group. SPOT matched the Gold Standard result in 258 of 268 (96.3%) calculations. The 10 instances (3.7%) when SPOT did not match were due to a rounding error. Users had a statistically significant increase in confidence in prescribing opioids after using SPOT. Focus group feedback highlighted benefits in Quality Improvement and Safety when using SPOT. SPOT is a safe,, reliable and validated CDS that has potential to reduce harms from opioid dosing errors.

24777588#ABSTRACT##The telecare medical information systems (TMISs) support convenient and rapid health-care services. A secure and efficient authentication scheme for TMIS provides safeguarding patients' electronic patient records (EPRs) and helps health care workers and medical personnel to rapidly making correct clinical decisions. Recently,, Kumari et al. proposed a password based user authentication scheme using smart cards for TMIS,, and claimed that the proposed scheme could resist various malicious attacks. However,, we point out that their scheme is still vulnerable to lost smart card and cannot provide forward secrecy. Subsequently,, Das and Goswami proposed a secure and efficient uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. They simulated their scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool to ensure that their scheme is secure against passive and active attacks. However,, we show that their scheme is still vulnerable to smart card loss attacks and cannot provide forward secrecy property. The proposed cryptanalysis discourages any use of the two schemes under investigation in practice and reveals some subtleties and challenges in designing this type of schemes.

26873939#ABSTRACT#AIMS#As digital pathology (DP) and whole slide imaging (WSI) technology advance and mature,, there is an increasing drive to incorporate DP into the diagnostic environment. However,, integration of DP into the diagnostic laboratory is a non-trivial task and filled with unexpected challenges unlike standalone implementations. We share our journey of implementing DP in the diagnostic laboratory setting,, highlighting seven key guiding principles that drive the progression through implementation into deployment and beyond.
26873939#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The DP implementation with laboratory information system integration was completed in 8 months,, including validation of the solution for diagnostic use in accordance with College of American Pathologists guidelines. We also conducted prospective validation via paired delivery of glass slides and WSI to our pathologists postdeployment.
26873939#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Common themes in our guiding principles included emphasis on workflow and being comprehensive in the approach,, looking beyond pathologist user champions and expanding into an extended project team involving laboratory technicians,, clerical/data room staff and archival staff. Concordance between glass slides and WSI ranged from 93% to 100% among various applications on validation. We also provided equal opportunities for every pathologist throughout the department to be competent and confident with DP through prospective validation,, with overall concordance of 96% compared with glass slides,, allowing appreciation of the advantages and limitations of WSI,, hence enabling the use of DP as a useful diagnostic modality.

35292073#ABSTRACT#TRIAL REGISTRATION#This was not a clinical trial and was therefore not registered as such.
24704734#ABSTRACT##Over the last 5 years,, telemedicine has developed nursing roles that differ from traditional bedside care. In the midst of this transition,, current competency development models focused on task completion may not be the most effective form of proficiency validation. The procedure of competency creation for the role of tele-intensive care unit registered nurse requires a thoughtful process using stakeholders from institutional leadership to frontline staff. The process must include stakeholder approval to ensure appropriate buy-in and follow-through on the agreed-upon criteria. This can be achieved using a standardized method of concept stimulation related to the behaviors,, not a memorized list of tasks,, expected of a telemedicine registered nurse. This process serves as the foundation for the development of criterion-based competency statements that then allows for clearer expectations. Continually reviewing the written competencies,, ensuring current applicability,, and revising as needed are necessities for maintaining competence and,, therefore,, patient safety.
35292073#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the growth in mobile technologies (mHealth) to support Community Health Worker (CHW) supervision,, the nature of mHealth-facilitated supervision remains underexplored. One strategy to support supervision at scale could be artificial intelligence (AI) modalities,, including machine learning. We developed an open access,, machine learning web application (CHWsupervisor) to predictively code instant messages exchanged between CHWs based on supervisory interaction codes. We document the development and validation of the web app and report its predictive accuracy.
35292073#ABSTRACT#METHODS#CHWsupervisor was developed using 2187 instant messages exchanged between CHWs and their supervisors in Uganda. The app was then validated on 1242 instant messages from a separate digital CHW supervisory network in Kenya. All messages from the training and validation data sets were manually coded by two independent human coders. The predictive performance of CHWsupervisor was determined by comparing the primary supervisory codes assigned by the web app,, against those assigned by the human coders and calculating observed percentage agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficients.
35292073#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Human inter-coder reliability for the primary supervisory category of messages across the training and validation datasets was 'substantial' to 'almost perfect',, as suggested by observed percentage agreements of 88-95% and Cohen's kappa values of 0.7-0.91. In comparison to the human coders,, the predictive accuracy of the CHWsupervisor web app was 'moderate',, suggested by observed percentage agreements of 73-78% and Cohen's kappa values of 0.51-0.56.
35292073#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Augmenting human coding is challenging because of the complexity of supervisory exchanges,, which often require nuanced interpretation. A realistic understanding of the potential of machine learning approaches should be kept in mind by practitioners,, as although they hold promise,, supportive supervision still requires a level of human expertise. Scaling-up digital CHW supervision may therefore prove challenging.

33341502#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most widely used protocol for activating a stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and other stress-mediating systems. A number of variants of the TSST exist,, including ones for children,, groups,, and virtual reality. All of these versions,, though,, require in-person assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person assessment impossible or extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. The purpose of this study was to validate a completely remote,, online,, version of the TSST for children.
33341502#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# = 0.57. Using 1.5 nmol/l (or 0.54 µg/dl) as the criterion for a response (Miller,, Plessow,, Kirschaum,, & Stalder,, 2013),, 63% of the participants produced a significant increase in cortisol.
33341502#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The responses to the TSST-OL are consistent with in-person responses among children and adolescents (see recent meta-analysis (Seddon et al.,, 2020). The protocol is a viable way of assessing reactivity of the HPA axis and other stress systems without needing to bring the participant into the research laboratory. This method will be useful during periods of widespread infection. It should also work to study populations who all live too far from the research laboratory to be assessed in person.

33341502#ABSTRACT#METHOD#A sample of 68 (27 female) 15- and 16-year old participants were administered the TSST-Online (TSST-OL) during the late afternoon hours (3-6 p.m. start time). The participants,, judges (one male,, one female),, and experimenter (female) all joined the assessment from their own homes via the online platform,, ZOOM™. Two sessions were conducted,, one to obtain consent,, explain procedures,, work with the family to arrange the computer and room set-up for the TSST-OL and one within two weeks to conduct the procedure. The participants were trained to take their own saliva samples and a saliva sampling kit was mailed to the home in between the first and second session. The samples were then mailed to the researchers within a day of collection. The participant was observed during saliva collection to determine correct procedures were followed. Salivary cortisol,, salivary a-amylase and self-reports of stress were measured multiple times over the second session.

36724818#ABSTRACT##The aim of this study was to describe the safety,, effectiveness,, and usability of a mobile-app based follow up platform after a heart failure (HF) hospitalization. It was a pilot,, prospective implementation study. 55 consecutive patients were included. Over 12?months,, a significant increase in the use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors was observed (91% vs 76%,, P < 0.04). Medication adherence,, assessed by daily patient validation in the app was 96%. No relevant changes were found in biochemical evaluations. The parameters of app usability showed a high value. At 12 months follow-up one patient was hospitalized for HF (1/55 [1,,8%]),, there was no cardiovascular death,, and 5 patients had non-cardiovascular deaths (5/55 [9.1%]). In patients recently discharged from HF hospitalization,, the implementation of non-invasive telemedicine follow-up was feasible,, safe and an effective strategy to increase the adherence to medical therapy. A high degree of clinical stability and a low rate of events were observed over 1-year.

34015657#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing worldwide. This offers ample opportunities for mobile health (mHealth) apps,, for example to support them in performing daily activities or monitoring their health status. However,, how to design these apps taking into consideration ADRD related barriers remains a challenge.
34015657#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To provide a synthesis of mHealth usability barriers of older adults with ADRD and design suggestions to enhance user-friendliness of mHealth apps.
34015657#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed a scoping review of mHealth studies focused on older adults with ADRD and: (1) usability barriers experienced,, and/or (2) implementation or design suggestions. PubMed,, Medline,, EMBASE,, PsycINFO,, and Web of Science were searched. Clinical and grey literature on ADRD diminishments was explored to identify potential barriers to using mHealth. Detected usability barriers caused by ADRD impairments were mapped onto the MOLD-US framework through validation,, calibration,, and adaption. MOLD-US was initially developed to provide an overview of barriers influencing mHealth usability for the general aging population.
34015657#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Title and abstract of 792 unique citations were scanned of which 69 were included for full text review. Fifteen studies matched inclusion criteria. In total 42 barriers were identified to influence mobile health use for older adults with ADRD. Twenty design suggestions were extracted from the studies.
34015657#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The identified usability barriers were classified in five categories: cognition,, perception,, physical ability,, frame of mind,, and speech- and language. In addition,, the design suggestions were categorized as evidence- or expert-based. Evidence-based design suggestions include showing limited information,, repeating instructions multiple times and breaking instructions into simple steps given one at a time. This research provides a first step for further collaboration between ADRD experts and designers to support the development of effective mHealth apps with high user-friendliness.

32162666#ABSTRACT##Digitization of healthcare will be a major innovation driver in the coming decade. Also,, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization,, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This,, in turn,, may make 4P medicine (predictive,, precise,, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care,, i.e. measurement of heart rate,, arrhythmia detection,, blood pressure,, hyperkalaemia,, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population,, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN),, which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity,, fluid overload,, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality,, not only must technical issues,, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed,, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization,, data representation,, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover,, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients,, healthcare providers and the payors,, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care.

33478495#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical inactivity is a global health concern. mHealth interventions have become increasingly popular,, but to date,, principles of effective communication from Self-Determination Theory have not been integrated with behavior change techniques to optimize app effectiveness. We outline the development of the START app,, an app combining SDT principles and 17 purposefully chosen BCTs to support inactive office employees to increase their walking during a 16-week randomized controlled trial. We also explored acceptability,, engagement with,, associations between app usage and behavioral engagement,, and perceived impact of the app in supporting behavior change.
33478495#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Following development,, fifty insufficiently physically active employees (M age?=?44.21?±?10.95 years; BMI?=?29.02?±?5.65) were provided access and instructions on use of the app. A mixed methods design was used to examine feasibility of the app,, including the User Mobile App Rating Scale,, app engagement data,, step counts,, and individual interviews. Linear mixed modeling and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data,, respectively.
33478495#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Walkers rated the app quality favorably (M?=?3.68 out of 5). Frequency of entering step counts (i.e.,, frequency of self-monitoring) on a weekly basis positively predicted weekly step counts measured via Fitbits at both the between-and within-individual levels. App features (entering daily step counts,, reminders,, and motivational messages) were perceived to assist walkers in fostering goal achievement by building competence and via self-monitoring.
33478495#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The START app may be a useful component of walking interventions designed to increase walking in the workplace. Apps designed to promote walking behavior may be effective if they target users' competence and integrate BCTs.
33478495#ABSTRACT#TRIAL REGISTRATION#This study was part of a pilot larger randomized controlled trial,, in which a component of the intervention involved the use of the mobile app. The trial was retrospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618000807257) on 11 May 2018 https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=375049&isReview=true .

32391799#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Video-mediated clinical consultations offer potential benefits over conventional face-to-face in terms of access,, convenience,, and sometimes cost. The improved technical quality and dependability of video-mediated consultations has opened up the possibility for more widespread use. However,, questions remain regarding clinical quality and safety. Video-mediated consultations are sometimes criticized for being not as good as face-to-face,, but there has been little previous in-depth research on their interactional dynamics,, and no agreement on what a good video consultation looks like.

32391799#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Using conversation analysis,, this study aimed to identify and analyze the communication strategies through which video-mediated consultations are accomplished and to produce recommendations for patients and clinicians to improve the communicative quality of such consultations.
32391799#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted an in-depth analysis of the clinician-patient interaction in a sample of video-mediated consultations and a comparison sample of face-to-face consultations drawn from 4 clinical settings across 2 trusts (1 community and 1 acute care) in the UK National Health Service. The video dataset consisted of 37 recordings of video-mediated consultations (with diabetes,, antenatal diabetes,, cancer,, and heart failure patients),, 28 matched audio recordings of face-to-face consultations,, and fieldnotes from before and after each consultation. We also conducted 37 interviews with staff and 26 interviews with patients. Using linguistic ethnography (combining analysis of communication with an appreciation of the context in which it takes place),, we examined in detail how video interaction was mediated by 2 software platforms (Skype and FaceTime).
32391799#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Patients had been selected by their clinician as appropriate for video-mediated consultation. Most consultations in our sample were technically and clinically unproblematic. However,, we identified 3 interactional challenges: (1) opening the video consultation,, (2) dealing with disruption to conversational flow (eg,, technical issues with audio and/or video),, and (3) conducting an examination. Operational and technological issues were the exception rather than the norm. In all but 1 case,, both clinicians and patients (deliberately or intuitively) used established communication strategies to successfully negotiate these challenges. Remote physical examinations required the patient (and,, in some cases,, a relative) to simultaneously follow instructions and manipulate technology (eg,, camera) to make it possible for the clinician to see and hear adequately.
32391799#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A remote video link alters how patients and clinicians interact and may adversely affect the flow of conversation. However,, our data suggest that when such problems occur,, clinicians and patients can work collaboratively to find ways to overcome them. There is potential for a limited physical examination to be undertaken remotely with some patients and in some conditions,, but this appears to need complex interactional work by the patient and/or their relatives. We offer preliminary guidance for patients and clinicians on what is and is not feasible when consulting via a video link.

34352402#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Shoulder range-of-motion (ROM) assessment is vital for the follow-up evaluation of operated patients and for the outcome-based research studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and reliability of a remote on-screen application (app)-based method of shoulder ROM measurement through a telehealth medium.
34352402#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#A consultant shoulder surgeon,, a board-certified orthopedic resident,, and a graduate medical doctor served as the examiners. The cohort consisted of 24 healthy volunteers and 16 symptomatic patients with expected shoulder ROM deficits. Shoulder ROM was first examined physically using a goniometer in the clinic and then over Zoom remote conferencing using the protractor extension app of the Chrome browser.
34352402#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Instrument validity was examined by comparing the goniometer method with the protractor app-based method of the expert shoulder consultant using Bland-Altman analysis. It showed only minor mean differences between the healthy volunteers and the patients in elevation (2.0° and 5.0°,, respectively),, abduction (2.0° and 3.0°,, respectively),, external rotation with the elbow adducted (1.9° and 0.2°,, respectively),, external rotation with the elbow abducted at 90° (0.4° and 4°,, respectively),, and internal rotation with elbow abducted at 90° (2.3° and 1.2°,, respectively),, with limits of agreement that were below the well-established minimal clinically important difference values. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values varied between 0.83 and 0.96 for the volunteers and between 0.90 and 0.98 for the patients,, indicating excellent correlation between the 2 methods. The interobserver reliability between 2 examiners for the protractor app-based method as evaluated by ICC scores was excellent; it ranged between 0.86 and 0.98 for the volunteers and between 0.88 and 0.99 for the patients. Comparison of the protractor app-based method with the gold-standard goniometer method for the resident and the graduate doctor showed excellent ICC values.
34352402#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A protractor app-based method of measuring shoulder ROM over a telehealth medium is accurate and reliable compared with a clinical goniometer method. This validated method can be used during remote telehealth consultation with significant benefits of saving patients travel and time during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and even later.

26245854#ABSTRACT##The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) helps the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and access medical services over the Internet of mobile networks. Recently,, Amin and Biswas presented a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for TMIS system using the cryptographic one-way hash function and biohashing function,, and claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. Though their scheme is efficient due to usage of one-way hash function,, we show that their scheme has several security pitfalls and design flaws,, such as (1) it fails to protect privileged-insider attack,, (2) it fails to protect strong replay attack,, (3) it fails to protect strong man-in-the-middle attack,, (4) it has design flaw in user registration phase,, (5) it has design flaw in login phase,, (6) it has design flaw in password change phase,, (7) it lacks of supporting biometric update phase,, and (8) it has flaws in formal security analysis. In order to withstand these security pitfalls and design flaws,, we aim to propose a secure and robust user authenticated key agreement scheme for the hierarchical multi-server environment suitable in TMIS using the cryptographic one-way hash function and fuzzy extractor. Through the rigorous security analysis including the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic,, the formal security analysis under the random oracle model and the informal security analysis,, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. Furthermore,, we simulate our scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The simulation results show that our scheme is also secure. Our scheme is more efficient in computation and communication as compared to Amin-Biswas's scheme and other related schemes. In addition,, our scheme supports extra functionality features as compared to other related schemes. As a result,, our scheme is very appropriate for practical applications in TMIS.

25230307#ABSTRACT##Wearable technologies for health monitoring have become a reality in the last few years. So far,, most research studies have focused on assessments of the technical performance of these systems,, as well as the validation of the clinical outcomes. Nevertheless,, the success in the acceptance of these solutions depends not only on the technical and clinical effectiveness,, but on the final user acceptance. In this work the compliance of a telehealth system for the remote monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is presented with testing in 32 PD patients. This system,, called PERFORM,, is based on a Body Area Network (BAN) of sensors which has already been validated both from the technical and clinical point for view. Diverse methodologies (REBA,, Borg and CRS scales in combination with a body map) are employed to study the comfort,, biomechanical and physiological effects of the system. The test results allow us to conclude that the acceptance of this system is satisfactory with all the levels of effect on each component scoring in the lowest ranges. This study also provided useful insights and guidelines to lead to redesign of the system to improve patient compliance.

27332299#ABSTRACT##Delirium is a common complication among patients in ICU settings. Although it has been repeatedly confirmed that Confusion Assessment Model for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU),, one of the most commonly used ICU delirium assessment tool,, is highly accurate in validation studies,, it's sensitivity and specificity is relatively low during routine practice among bedside nurses. The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application (app) to detect delirium and to test its reliability and validity both by research nurses and among ICU bedside nurses. The app was programmed with Java and installed on a mobile device with Android system. After completion of reliability and validity testing,, the app will be integrated into the existing Hospital Information System in order to automatically retrieve essential information for risk factor identification and formulation of care plan accordingly to prevent or manage ICU delirium.

36429670#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health-related mobile applications (apps) are rapidly increasing in number. There is an urgent need for assessment tools and algorithms that allow the usability and content criteria of these applications to be objectively assessed. The aim of this work was to establish and validate a concept for orthopedic societies to rate health apps to set a quality standard for their safe use.
36429670#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An objective rating concept was created,, consisting of nine quality criteria. A self-declaration sheet for app manufacturers was designed. Manufacturers completed the self-declaration,, and the app was examined by independent internal reviewers. The pilot validation and analysis were performed on two independent health applications. An algorithm for orthopedic societies was created based on the experiences in this study flow.
36429670#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#"Sprunggelenks-App" was approved by the reviewers with 45 (98%) fulfilled criteria and one (2%) unfulfilled criterion. "Therapie-App" was approved,, with 28 (61%) met criteria,, 6 (13%) unfulfilled criteria and 12 (26%) criteria that could not be assessed. The self-declaration completed by the app manufacturer is recommended,, followed by a legal and technical rating performed by an external institution. When rated positive,, the societies' internal review using independent raters can be performed. In case of a positive rating,, a visual certification can be granted to the manufacturer for a certain time frame.
36429670#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#An objective rating algorithm is proposed for the assessment of digital health applications. This can help societies to improve the quality assessment,, quality assurance and patient safety of those apps. The proposed concept must be further validated for inter-rater consistency and reliability.

26292349#ABSTRACT##This paper introduces a pulse oximeter prototype designed for mobile healthcare. In this prototype,, a reflection pulse oximeter is embedded into the back cover of a smart handheld device to offer the convenient measurement of both heart rate (HR) and SpO2 (estimation of arterial oxygen saturation) for home or mobile applications. Novel and miniaturized circuit modules including a chopper network and a filtering amplifier were designed to overcome the influence of ambient light and interferences that are caused by embedding the sensor into a flat cover. A method based on adaptive trough detection for improved HR and SpO2 estimation is proposed with appropriate simplification for its implementation on mobile devices. A fast and effective photoplethysmogram validation scheme is also proposed. Clinical experiments have been carried out to calibrate and test our oximeter. Our prototype oximeter can achieve comparable performance to a clinical oximeter with no significant difference revealed by paired t -tests ( p = 0.182 for SpO2 measurement and p = 0.496 for HR measurement). The design of this pulse oximeter will facilitate fast and convenient measurement of SpO2 for mobile healthcare.

36469402#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Approximately 110 million Farsi speakers worldwide have access to a growing mobile app market. Despite restrictions and international sanctions,, Iran's internal mobile health app market is growing,, especially for Android-based apps. However,, there is a need for guidelines for developing health apps that meet international quality standards. There are also no tools in Farsi that assess health app quality. Developers and researchers who operate in Farsi could benefit from such quality assessment tools to improve their outputs.
36469402#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to translate and culturally adapt the Mobile Application Rating Scale in Farsi (MARS-Fa). This study also evaluates the validity and reliability of the newly developed MARS-Fa tool.
36469402#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used a well-established method to translate and back translate the MARS-Fa tool with a group of Iranian and international experts in Health Information Technology and Psychology. The final translated version of the tool was tested on a sample of 92 apps addressing smartphone addiction. Two trained reviewers completed an independent assessment of each app in Farsi and English. We reported reliability and construct validity estimates for the objective scales (engagement,, functionality,, aesthetics,, and information quality). Reliability was based on the evaluation of intraclass correlation coefficients,, Cronbach a and Spearman-Brown split-half reliability indicators (for internal consistency),, as well as Pearson correlations for test-retest reliability. Construct validity included convergent and discriminant validity (through item-total correlations within the objective scales) and concurrent validity using Pearson correlations between the objective and subjective scores.
36469402#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After completing the translation and cultural adaptation,, the MARS-Fa tool was used to assess the selected apps for smartphone addiction. The MARS-Fa total scale showed good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.83,, 95% CI 0.74-0.89) and good internal consistency (Cronbach a=.84); Spearman-Brown split-half reliability for both raters was 0.79 to 0.93. The instrument showed excellent test-retest reliability (r=0.94). The correlations among the MARS-Fa subdomains and the total score were all significant and above r=0.40,, suggesting good convergent and discriminant validity. The MARS-Fa was positively and significantly correlated with subjective quality (r=0.90,, P<.001),, and so were the objective subdomains of engagement (r=0.85,, P<.001),, information quality (r=0.80,, P<.001),, aesthetics (r=0.79,, P<.001),, and functionality (r=0.57,, P<.001),, indicating concurrent validity.
36469402#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MARS-Fa is a reliable and valid instrument to assess mobile health apps. This instrument could be adopted by Farsi-speaking researchers and developers who want to evaluate the quality of mobile apps. While we tested the tool with a sample of apps addressing smartphone addiction,, the MARS-Fa could assess other domains or issues since the Mobile App Rating Scale has been used to rate apps in different contexts and languages.

34210374#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used measure of depression in primary care. It was,, however,, originally designed as a diagnostic screening tool,, and not for measuring change in response to antidepressant treatment. Although the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology (QIDS-SR-16) has been extensively validated for outcome measurement,, it is poorly adopted in UK primary care,, and,, although free for clinicians,, has licensing restrictions for healthcare organisation use.

34210374#ABSTRACT#AIMS#We aimed to develop a modified version of the PHQ-9,, the Maudsley Modified PHQ-9 (MM-PHQ-9),, for tracking symptom changes in primary care. We tested the measure's validity,, reliability and factor structure.
34210374#ABSTRACT#METHOD#A sample of 121 participants was recruited across three studies,, and comprised 78 participants with major depressive disorder and 43 controls. MM-PHQ-9 scores were compared with the QIDS-SR-16 and Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale,, for concurrent validity. Internal consistency of the scale was assessed,, and principal component analysis was conducted to determine the items' factor structure.
34210374#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The MM-PHQ-9 demonstrated good concurrent validity with the QIDS-SR-16,, and excellent internal consistency. Sensitivity to change over a 14-week period was d = 0.41 compared with d = 0.61 on the QIDS-SR-16. Concurrent validity between the paper and mobile app versions of the MM-PHQ-9 was r = 0.67.
34210374#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These results indicate that the MM-PHQ-9 is a valid and reliable measure of depressive symptoms in paper and mobile app format,, although further validation is required. The measure was sensitive to change,, demonstrating suitability for use in routine outcome assessment.
31361870#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The development,, testing,, and preliminary validation of a technology-enabled,, pharmacist-led intervention aimed at improving medication safety and outcomes in kidney transplant recipients are described.
31361870#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#Medication safety issues,, encompassing medication errors (MEs),, medication nonadherence,, and adverse drug events (ADEs),, are a predominant cause of poor outcomes after kidney transplantation. However,, a limited number of clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of technology in improving medication safety and outcomes in transplant recipients have been conducted. Through an iterative,, evidence-based approach,, a technology-enabled intervention aimed at improving posttransplant medication safety outcomes was developed,, tested,, and preliminarily validated. Early acceptability and feasibility results from a prospective,, randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of this system are reported here. Of the 120 patients enrolled into the trial at the time of writing,, 60 were randomly assigned to receive the intervention. At a mean ± S.D. follow-up of 5.8 ± 4.0 months,, there were 2 patient dropouts in the intervention group,, resulting in a retention rate of 98%,, which was higher than the expected 90% retention rate.
31361870#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The development and deployment of a comprehensive medication safety monitoring dashboard for kidney transplant recipients is feasible and acceptable to patients in the current healthcare environment. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial is assessing whether such a system reduces MEs and ADRs,, leading to improved patient outcomes.

14680516#ABSTRACT##A telecare system (Medic4All) has been developed that relies on a wireless wristwatch-like sensor to measure the pulse wave from the radial artery. From this,, the heart rate and respiration rate are derived. The system's performance was examined by comparing the results obtained from the pulse wave signal with those obtained from conventional electrocardiographic and spirometer devices. A total of 144 patients participated in the study; their mean (SD) age was 43 (18) years. There were 44 cardiac patients in group 1 and 100 healthy patients,, who were studied in their homes,, in group 2. There was a significant correlation between the heart rates measured by the two monitoring methods. A 'difference versus average' analysis showed that the error distribution had a mean (SD) value of -0.1 (3.3) beats/min. Similarly,, the respiration rates measured by the two techniques were significantly correlated. The error distribution had a mean (SD) value of 0.1 (1.9) respirations/min. The present study suggests that the wrist-worn sensor represents a promising tool for online detection and monitoring of vital signs in the home.

36661353#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Following the outbreak of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus it was necessary to increase the non-face-to-face care activity through alternative means such as teleconsultation in primary health care. The adjustment to a type of remote consultation could have generated anxiety among family physicians. The main aim of the present study was to develop and validate a scale to assess the anxiety of family physicians during teleconsultation.
36661353#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#Observational,, cross-sectional study involving a sample of family physicians working in Portugal. An online survey that evaluated anxiety in teleconsultation was developed.
36661353#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#AnsT-19 is a valid instrument to assess the anxiety of family physicians during teleconsultation.

36661353#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 359 valid responses were included in an exploratory factor analysis,, after determining the number of factors to retain. A four-factor structure was detected with loadings ranging overall,, from 0.44 to 0.98. Correlations between factors ranged from 0.42 to 0.58. Exploratory factor analysis results varied between good and very good fit,, with chi-square/df result = 2.448,, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.062 [90% CI = (0.053,, 0.073)],, root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) = 0.030 and Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.931. Composite reliability was higher than 0.7 for all factors and average variance extracted was close or above 0.5 for the extracted factors,, confirming convergent validity. McDonald's omega (?) = 0.95 suggested the presence of a second-order factor,, and thus a global measure for assessing anxiety during teleconsultation. Concurrent validity results were good,, with correlations ranging from r = -0.277 to r = -0.393 with General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and r = 0.302 to r = 0.547 with Depression Anxiety Stress scales (DASS). Moderate correlations found between DASS and the dimensions of AnsT-19 suggest that AnsT-19 is capturing anxiety from the teleconsultation point of view. AnsT-19 factors and total score were significantly associated with gender,, experience as a family doctor,, psychotropic medication during the pandemic period and pre-pandemic experience of teleconsultation,, indicating good construct validity. The limitations of the study are related to the convenience process,, the use of an online survey and self-reported measurements.

26209109#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Only 3 apps scored above 50% on the aerobic component (mean 0.7514,, SD 1.2150,, maximum 4.1636),, 4 scored above 50% on the resistance/strength component (mean 1.4525,, SD 1.2101,, maximum 4.1094),, and no app scored above 50% on the flexibility component (mean 0.1118,, SD 0.2679,, maximum 0.9816). Finally,, only 1 app had an overall score (64.3%) above 50% (mean 2.3158,, SD 1.911,, maximum 9.0072).
26209109#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There are over 100,,000 health-related apps. When looking at popular free apps related to physical activity,, we observe that very few of them are evidence based,, and respect the guidelines for aerobic activity,, strength/resistance training,, and flexibility,, set forth by the ACSM. Users should exercise caution when adopting a new app for physical activity purposes. This study also clearly identifies a gap in evidence-based apps that can be used safely and effectively to start a physical routine program,, develop fitness,, and lose weight. App developers have an exciting opportunity to improve mobile coaching app quality by addressing these gaps.

16617615#ABSTRACT##Today,, the growth of the aging population in Europe needs an increasing number of health care professionals and facilities for aged persons. Medical telemonitoring at home (and,, more generally,, telemedicine) improves the patient's comfort and reduces hospitalization costs. Using sound surveillance as an alternative solution to video telemonitoring,, this paper deals with the detection and classification of alarming sounds in a noisy environment. The proposed sound analysis system can detect distress or everyday sounds everywhere in the monitored apartment,, and is connected to classical medical telemonitoring sensors through a data fusion process. The sound analysis system is divided in two stages: sound detection and classification. The first analysis stage (sound detection) must extract significant sounds from a continuous signal flow. A new detection algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform is proposed in this paper,, which leads to accurate results when applied to nonstationary signals (such as impulsive sounds). The algorithm presented in this paper was evaluated in a noisy environment and is favorably compared to the state of the art algorithms in the field. The second stage of the system is sound classification,, which uses a statistical approach to identify unknown sounds. A statistical study was done to find out the most discriminant acoustical parameters in the input of the classification module. New wavelet based parameters,, better adapted to noise,, are proposed in this paper. The telemonitoring system validation is presented through various real and simulated test sets. The global sound based system leads to a 3% missed alarm rate and could be fused with other medical sensors to improve performance.

26209109#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Low physical activity level is a significant contributor to chronic disease,, weight dysregulation,, and mortality. Nearly 70% of the American population is overweight,, and 35% is obese. Obesity costs an estimated US$ 147 billion annually in health care,, and as many as 95 million years of life. Although poor nutritional habits remain the major culprit,, lack of physical activity significantly contributes to the obesity epidemic and related lifestyle diseases.
26209109#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Over the past 10 years,, mobile devices have become ubiquitous,, and there is an ever-increasing number of mobile apps that are being developed to facilitate physical activity,, particularly for active people. However,, no systematic assessment has been performed about their quality with respect to following the parameters of sound fitness principles and scientific evidence,, or suitability for a variety of fitness levels. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap and assess the quality of mobile coaching apps on iOS mobile devices.

26209109#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A set of 30 popular mobile apps pertaining to physical activity programming was identified and reviewed on an iPhone device. These apps met the inclusion criteria and provided specific prescriptive fitness and exercise programming content. The content of these apps was compared against the current guidelines and fitness principles established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). A weighted scoring method based on the recommendations of the ACSM was developed to generate subscores for quality of programming content for aerobic (0-6 scale),, resistance (0-6 scale),, and flexibility (0-2 scale) components using the frequency,, intensity,, time,, and type (FITT) principle. An overall score (0-14 scale) was generated from the subscores to represent the overall quality of a fitness coaching app.

35730115#ABSTRACT##Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Motivations for outcome data collection in TBI are threefold: to improve patient outcomes,, to facilitate research,, and to provide the means and methods for wider injury surveillance. Such data play a pivotal role in population health,, and ways to increase the reliability of data collection following TBI should be pursued. As a result,, technology-aided follow-up of patients with neurotrauma is on the rise; there is,, therefore,, a need to describe how such technologies have been used. A scoping review was conducted and reported using the PRISMA extension (PRISMA-ScR). Five electronic databases (Embase,, MEDLINE,, Global Health,, PsycInfo,, and Scopus) were searched systematically using keywords derived from the concepts of "telemedicine,," "TBI,," "outcome assessment,," and "patient-generated health data." Forty studies described follow-up technologies (FUTs) utilizing telephones (52.5%,, n?=?21),, short message service (SMS; 10%,, n?=?4),, smartphones (22.5%,, n?=?9),, videoconferencing (10%,, n?=?4),, digital assistants (2.5%,, n?=?1),, and custom devices (2.5%,, n?=?1) among cohorts of patients with TBI of varying injury severity. Where reported,, clinical facilitators,, remote follow-up timing and intervals between sessions,, synchronicity of follow-up instances,, proxy involvement,, outcome measures utilized,, and technology evaluation efforts are described. FUTs can aid more temporally sensitive assessments and capture fluctuating sequelae,, a benefit of particular relevance to TBI cohorts. However,, the evidence base surrounding FUTs remains in its infancy,, particularly with respect to large samples,, low- and middle-income patient cohorts,, and the validation of outcome measures for deployment via such remote technology.

31194585#ABSTRACT##Among the many uses of digital pathology,, remote consultation,, remote revision,, and virtual slide panels may be the most important ones. This requires basic slide scanner infrastructure in participating laboratories to produce whole-slide images. More importantly,, a software platform is needed for exchange of these images and functionality to support the processes around discussing and reporting on these images without breaching patient privacy. This poses high demands on the setup of such a platform,, given the inherent complexity of the handling of digital pathology images. In this article,, we describe the setup and validation of the Pathology Image Exchange project,, which aimed to create a vendor-independent platform for exchange of whole-slide images between Dutch pathology laboratories to facilitate efficient teleconsultation,, telerevision,, and virtual slide panels. Pathology Image Exchange was released in April 2018 after technical validation,, and a first successful validation in real life has been performed for hematopathology cases.

32012077#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Six electronic databases-Medline,, Embase,, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL),, AusHealth,, Nursing@Ovid,, and Google Scholar-were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2018 using the following keywords: Education,, Distance,, Continuing,, Learning,, Online,, Web-Based,, Internet,, Dementia,, Program Evaluation,, Validation Studies,, Outcome and Process Assessment Healthcare,, Nursing,, Assisted Instruction,, and Facilitated. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Kirkpatrick's model for the evaluation of training were used to ensure quality and rigor of the analysis.
32012077#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. In total,, 14 key features were associated with an effective Web-based learning environment,, which enabled the environment to be as follows: self-directed,, individualized,, interactive,, multimodal,, flexible,, accessible,, consistent,, cost-effective,, measurable with respect to participant satisfaction,, equitable,, facilitated,, nurturing of critical thinking and reflection,, supportive of creating a learning community,, and translated into practice. These features were further categorized into five subgroups: applicability,, attractiveness,, functionality,, learner interaction,, and implementation into practice. Literature frequently cites Kirkpatrick's four-level model of evaluation and application in the review of education and training; however,, few studies appeared to integrate all four levels of Kirkpatrick's model. Features were then correlated against the DCC&TN,, with an encouraging connection found between these features and their inclusion within the content and structure of the DCC&TN.

32012077#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A total of 14 key features were identified that support an effective and functional Web-based learning environment. Few studies incorporated Kirkpatrick's salient elements of the model-reaction,, learning,, behavior,, and results-in their evaluation and clinical application. It could,, therefore,, be considered prudent to include Kirkpatrick's levels of training evaluation within studies of dementia training. There were few studies that evaluated Web-based dementia education programs,, with even fewer reporting evidence that Web-based training could increase staff confidence,, knowledge,, skills,, and attitudes toward people with dementia and be sustainable over time. The DCC&TN appeared to contain the majority of key features and is one of the few programs inclusive of hospital,, community,, and residential care settings. The 14 key features can potentially enhance and complement future development of online training programs for health sciences education and beyond. The DCC&TN model could potentially be used as a template for future developers and evaluators of Web-based dementia training.

33692488#ABSTRACT##While there has been a rapid growth of digital health apps to support chronic diseases,, clear standards on how to best evaluate the quality of these evolving tools are absent. This scoping review aims to synthesize the emerging field of mobile health app quality assessment by reviewing criteria used by previous studies to assess the quality of mobile apps for chronic disease management. A literature review was conducted in September 2017 for published studies that use a set of quality criteria to directly evaluate two or more patient-facing apps supporting promote chronic disease management. This resulted in 8182 citations which were reviewed by research team members,, resulting in 65 articles for inclusion. An inductive coding schema to synthesize the quality criteria utilized by included articles was developed,, with 40 unique quality criteria identified. Of the 43 (66%) articles that reported resources used to support criteria selection,, 19 (29%) used clinical guidelines,, and 10 (15%) used behavior change theory. The most commonly used criteria included the presence of user engagement or behavior change functions (97%,, n?=?63) and technical features of the app such as customizability (20%,, n?=?13,, while Usability was assessed by 24 studies (36.9%). This study highlights the significant variation in quality criteria employed for the assessment of mobile health apps. Future methods for app evaluation will benefit from approaches that leverage the best evidence regarding the clinical impact and behavior change mechanisms while more directly reflecting patient needs when evaluating the quality of apps.

34680860#ABSTRACT##Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),, subdivided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),, are chronic diseases that are characterized by relapsing and remitting periods of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. In recent years,, the amount of research surrounding digital health (DH) and artificial intelligence (AI) has increased. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore this growing field of research to summarize the role of DH and AI in the diagnosis,, treatment,, monitoring and prognosis of IBD. A review of 21 articles revealed the impact of both AI algorithms and DH technologies; AI algorithms can improve diagnostic accuracy,, assess disease activity,, and predict treatment response based on data modalities such as endoscopic imaging and genetic data. In terms of DH,, patients utilizing DH platforms experienced improvements in quality of life,, disease literacy,, treatment adherence,, and medication management. In addition,, DH methods can reduce the need for in-person appointments,, decreasing the use of healthcare resources without compromising the standard of care. These articles demonstrate preliminary evidence of the potential of DH and AI for improving the management of IBD. However,, the majority of these studies were performed in a regulated clinical environment. Therefore,, further validation of these results in a real-world environment is required to assess the efficacy of these methods in the general IBD population.

28790022#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The BRANCH app contains a drinking diary,, alcohol reduction goal setting functions,, normative drinking feedback,, and information on risks and advice for cutting down. The app includes a social feature personalized to motivate cutting down and to promote engagement with a point-based system for usage. Three focus groups were conducted with 20 users who had tested the app for 1 week. A detailed thematic analysis was undertaken.
28790022#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The first theme,, "Functionality" referred to how users wanted an easy-to-use interface,, with minimum required user-input. Poor functionality was considered a major usability barrier. The second theme,, "Design" described how an aesthetic with minimum text,, clearly distinguishable tabs and buttons and appealing infographics was integral to the level of usability. The final theme,, "Content" described how participants wanted all aspects of the app to be automatically personalized to them,, as well as providing them with opportunities to personalize the app themselves,, with increased options for social connectivity.
28790022#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There are high demands for apps such as BRANCH that target skilled technology users including young adults. Key areas to optimize eSBI app development that emerged from testing BRANCH with representative users include high-quality functionality,, appealing aesthetics,, and improved personalization.
21572262#ABSTRACT##Distance delivery systems are being developed to increase access to mental health care. Although development is progressing rapidly,, there has been little work delineating the differences between distance and face-to-face interventions from the participants' viewpoint. This article describes scale development and a content validity study of the Treatment Barrier Index (TBI). The TBI scale has acceptable content validity (Content Validity Index = 0.96). The TBI scale will be used to examine delivery system differences. Evidence of the differences between systems may help to inform delivery system designs,, ensuring that participant needs are met by enhancing access to evidence-based care.

9277643#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To establish whether first-trimester obstetric ultrasonography interpreted by a live video telemedicine link is comparable to an established videotape review network in a low-risk patient population.
9277643#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An integrated services digital network was established from three satellite offices to our central prenatal diagnostic center. All patients had a sonographic evaluation of the uterus,, adnexa,, and gestational sac recorded onto videotape by a trained sonographer. A live,, interactive video telemedicine link was established,, and a perinatologist directed the sonographer through the scan. Subsequently,, a different perinatologist,, blinded to the telemedicine interpretation,, reviewed the original videotaped examination. The reports generated from both modalities then were compared by means of a score of 12 sonographic characteristics.

9277643#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The first 100 patients were included. The mean gestational age (+/-standard deviation) was 8.9 +/- 2.3 weeks (range 5.7-14.4),, and the mean duration for telemedicine scans was 7.8 +/- 2.9 minutes (range 3.8-20.1). Telemedicine and videotape review scores were the same in 95 cases,, and the final diagnosis was identical in 98 cases. This study had 80% power to detect a 10% difference in diagnosis at a significance level of .05. The ability to detect abnormalities was equivalent using both systems.
9277643#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The interpretation of first-trimester obstetric ultrasonography using live video telemedicine is equivalent to a system of videotape review. Obstetric telemedicine may prove to be a useful tool for providing sonographic imaging for low-risk obstetric patients.

30894029#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health information technology (IT) solutions can aid healthcare reform efforts,, but without proper information management,, these efforts are futile. In this study,, we used Kuwait as an example of a high per-capita gross domestic product country that faces information management challenges to draw insights that can be generalised to other developed countries.
30894029#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#(i) to uncover the status quo of information management practices in public hospitals and (ii) to offer recommendations to improve them.
30894029#ABSTRACT#METHOD#This study analysed qualitative and quantitative accreditation-related data pertaining to the compliance with the information management standard at all secondary care public hospitals over two accreditation cycles.
30894029#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, public hospitals had made positive progress in their compliance with the information management standard. However,, issues still existed with (i) developing and implementing an information management plan,, (ii) involving the appropriate stakeholders in selecting health IT solutions and (iii) access to the Internet by staff and patients.
30894029#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Evidence underscored the importance of proper information management driven by clear centralised strategic plans.
30894029#ABSTRACT#IMPLICATIONS#With the rapid adoption of digital health systems,, the role of health information management leaders should not be undervalued. Embracing health IT solutions with strong information management practices can aid healthcare reform efforts.

15615032#ABSTRACT##This paper describes an advanced care and alert portable telemedical monitor (AMON),, a wearable medical monitoring and alert system targeting high-risk cardiac/respiratory patients. The system includes continuous collection and evaluation of multiple vital signs,, intelligent multiparameter medical emergency detection,, and a cellular connection to a medical center. By integrating the whole system in an unobtrusive,, wrist-worn enclosure and applying aggressive low-power design techniques,, continuous long-term monitoring can be performed without interfering with the patients' everyday activities and without restricting their mobility. In the first two and a half years of this EU IST sponsored project,, the AMON consortium has designed,, implemented,, and tested the described wrist-worn device,, a communication link,, and a comprehensive medical center software package. The performance of the system has been validated by a medical study with a set of 33 subjects. The paper describes the main concepts behind the AMON system and presents details of the individual subsystems and solutions as well as the results of the medical validation.

36066928#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital innovations are yet to make real impacts in the care home sector despite the considerable potential of digital health approaches to help with continued staff shortages and to improve quality of care. To understand the current landscape of digital innovation in long-term care facilities such as nursing and care homes,, it is important to find out which clinical decision support tools are currently used in long-term care facilities,, what their purpose is,, how they were developed,, and what types of data they use.
36066928#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this review was to analyze studies that evaluated clinical decision support tools in long-term care facilities based on the purpose and intended users of the tools,, the evidence base used to develop the tools,, how the tools are used and their effectiveness,, and the types of data the tools use to contribute to the existing scientific evidence to inform a roadmap for digital innovation,, specifically for clinical decision support tools,, in long-term care facilities.

36066928#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A review of the literature published between January 1,, 2010,, and July 21,, 2021,, was conducted,, using key search terms in 3 scientific journal databases: PubMed,, Cochrane Library,, and the British Nursing Index. Only studies evaluating clinical decision support tools in long-term care facilities were included in the review.
36066928#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 17 papers were included in the final review. The clinical decision support tools described in these papers were evaluated for medication management,, pressure ulcer prevention,, dementia management,, falls prevention,, hospitalization,, malnutrition prevention,, urinary tract infection,, and COVID-19 infection. In general,, the included studies show that decision support tools can show improvements in delivery of care and in health outcomes.
36066928#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Although the studies demonstrate the potential of positive impact of clinical decision support tools,, there is variability in results,, in part because of the diversity of types of decision support tools,, users,, and contexts as well as limited validation of the tools in use and in part because of the lack of clarity in defining the whole intervention.

32002136#ABSTRACT##Background: Mobile health applications (apps) are considered to complement traditional psychological treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However,, the use for clinical practice and quality of available apps is unknown. Objective: To assess the general characteristics,, therapeutic background,, content,, and quality of apps for PTSD and to examine their concordance with established PTSD treatment and self-help methods. Method: A web crawler systematically searched for apps targeting PTSD in the British Google Play and Apple iTunes stores. Two independent researchers rated the apps using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). The content of high-quality apps was checked for concordance with psychological treatment and self-help methods extracted from current literature on PTSD treatment. Results: Out of 555 identified apps,, 69 met the inclusion criteria. The overall app quality based on the MARS was medium (M = 3.36,, SD = 0.65). Most apps (50.7%) were based on cognitive behavioural therapy and offered a wide range of content,, including established psychological PTSD treatment methods such as processing of trauma-related emotions and beliefs,, relaxation exercises,, and psychoeducation. Notably,, data protection and privacy standards were poor in most apps and only one app (1.4%) was scientifically evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: High-quality apps based on established psychological treatment techniques for PTSD are available in commercial app stores. However,, users are confronted with great difficulties in identifying useful high-quality apps and most apps lack an evidence-base. Commercial distribution channels do not exploit the potential of apps to complement the psychological treatment of PTSD.

37458961#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#A setting-sensitive instrument for assessing Quality of Life (QoL) in Telemedicine (TM) was unavailable. To close this gap,, a content-valid "add-on" measure was developed. In parallel,, a brief index was derived featuring six items that summarise the main content of the multidimensional assessment. After pre- and pilot-testing,, the psychometric performance of the final measures was investigated in an independent validation study.
37458961#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The questionnaires were applied along with other standardised instruments of similar concepts as well as associated,, yet disparate concepts for validation purposes. The sample consisted of patients with depression or heart failure,, with or without TM (n?=?200). Data analyses were aimed at calculating descriptive statistics and testing the psychometric performance on item,, scale,, and instrument level,, including different types of validity and reliability.
37458961#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The proposed factor structure of the multidimensional Tele-QoL measure has been confirmed. Reliability coefficients for internal consistency,, split-half,, and test-retest reliability of the subscales and index reached sufficient values. The Tele-QoL subscales and the index demonstrated Rasch scalability. Validity of both instruments can be assumed. Evidence for discriminant construct validity was provided.

37458961#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Both measures show convincing psychometric properties. The final multidimensional Tele-QoL assessment consists of six outcome scales and two impact scales assessing (un-)intended effects of TM on QoL. In addition,, the Tele-QoL index provides a short alternative for outcome assessment. The Tele-QoL measures can be used as complementary modules to existing QoL instruments capturing healthcare-related aspects of QoL from the patients' perspective.

29976474#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telephone nursing is the first line of contact for many care-seekers and aims at optimizing the performance of the healthcare system by supporting and guiding patients to the correct level of care and reduce the amount of unscheduled visits. Good statistical models that describe the effects of telephone nursing are important in order to study its impact on healthcare resources and evaluate changes in telephone nursing procedures.
29976474#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop a valid model that captures the complex relationships between the nurse's recommendations,, the patients' intended actions and the patients' health seeking behavior. Using the model to estimate the effects of telephone nursing on patient behavior,, healthcare utilization,, and infer potential cost savings.
29976474#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Bayesian ordinal regression modeling of data from randomly selected patients that received telephone nursing. Inference is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods,, model selection using the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC),, and model validation using posterior predictive checks on standard discrepancy measures.

29976474#ABSTRACT#RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS#We present a robust Bayesian ordinal regression model that predicts three-quarters of the patients' healthcare utilization after telephone nursing and we found no evidence of model deficiencies. A patient's compliance to the nurse's recommendation varies and depends on the recommended level of care,, its agreement with and level of the patient's prior intention,, and the availability of different care options at the time. The model reveals a risk reducing behavior among patients and the effect of the telephone nursing recommendation is 7 times higher than the effect of the patient's intended action prior to consultation if the recommendation is the highest level of care. But the effect of the nurse's recommendation is lower,, or even non-existing,, if the recommendation is self-care. Telephone nursing was found to have a constricting effect on healthcare utilization,, however,, the compliance to nurse's recommendation is closely tied to perceptions of risk,, emphasizing the importance to address caller's needs of reassurance.

34345774#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Consumer health care technology shows potential to improve outcomes for community-dwelling persons with chronic conditions,, yet health app quality varies considerably. In partnership with patients and family caregivers,, hospital clinicians developed Care4myHeart,, a mobile health (mHealth) app for heart failure (HF) self-management.
34345774#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper was to report the outcomes of the nurse-led design process in the form of the features and functions of the developed app,, Care4myHeart.
34345774#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Seven patients,, four family caregivers,, and seven multidisciplinary hospital clinicians collaborated in a design thinking process of innovation. The co-design process,, involving interviews,, design workshops,, and prototype feedback sessions,, incorporated the lived experience of stakeholders and evidence-based literature in a design that would be relevant and developed with rigor.
32330408#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#Each patient underwent tele-cystoscopy by a trained advanced practice provider and traditional cystoscopy with an onsite urologist. Prospectively collected tele-cystoscopy transmitted video,, tele-cystoscopy onsite video and traditional cystoscopy video were de-identified and blinded to external reviewers. Each video was evaluated and rated twice by independent reviewers and diagnostic agreement was quantified.
32330408#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Six tele-cystoscopy encounters were reviewed for a total of 36 assessments. Video clarity,, defined by speed of transmission and image resolution,, was better for onsite compared to transmitted tele-cystoscopy. Practitioner proficiency for thoroughness of inspection was rated at 92% for tele-cystoscopy and 100% for traditional cystoscopy. Confidence in identification of an abnormality was equivalent. Four of 6 videos had 100% agreement between reviewers for next action taken,, indicating high diagnostic agreement. Additionally,, provider performing cystoscopy and location did not statistically influence the ability to make a diagnosis or action taken.

34345774#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The home screen displays the priority HF self-management components with a reminder summary,, general information on the condition,, and a settings tab. The health management section allows patients to list health care team member's contact details,, schedule medical appointments,, and store documents. The My Plan section contains nine important self-management components with a combination of information and advice pages,, graphical representation of patient data,, feedback,, and more. The greatest strength of the co-design process to achieve the design outcomes was the involvement of local patients,, family caregivers,, and clinicians. Moreover,, incorporating the literature,, guidelines,, and current practices into the design strengthened the relevance of the app to the health care context. However,, the strength of context specificity is also a limitation to portability,, and the final design is limited to the stakeholders involved in its development.
34345774#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We recommend health app development teams strategically incorporate relevant stakeholders and literature to design mHealth solutions that are rigorously designed from a solid evidence base and are relevant to those who will use or recommend their use.

17517348#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of a videophone-based system for remote cardiopulmonary examination of patients with heart failure.
17517348#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#Fifty patients were examined by 2 cardiologists,, 1 with a conventional stethoscope and 1 remotely with a videophone-based method,, employing an electronic stethoscope and transmitting through an integrated services digital network line. During both sessions,, the cardiologists filled out a 27-item questionnaire,, which was then compared; concordance between standard and remote examination was evaluated. In 92% of patients,, electronic and acoustic auscultation concurred. Only in 3 patients (4%) did teleauscultation not permit a correct interpretation of lung examination. In one patient,, bilateral fine crepitant rales were not detected during teleauscultation. Conversely,, in the second,, patient bilateral fine crepitant rales were recognized during teleauscultation,, which were not confirmed during real-life auscultation. In the third nonconcordant patient,, moderate-degree wheezing was not detected during teleauscultation. Fine crepitant rales were present at the lungs lower fields in 12 and wheezing in 3 additional patients,, and were always correctly identified during teleauscultation. Overall,, sensitivity,, specificity,, positive,, and negative predictive value of remote lung auscultation were 88%,, 97%,, 94%,, and 94%,, respectively.
17517348#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Remote cardiopulmonary examination appears as a feasible method for assessing patients with heart failure. Telestethoscopy can therefore be reliably used in the context of comprehensive telecare programs.

34636741#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The experience of infertility and its treatment engenders considerable stress and is often described as an emotional rollercoaster. A mobile health (mHealth) app may be a novel solution to address the psychoeducational and psychosocial support needs of fertility patients because of its potential to reduce stress and increase patient empowerment. There are a few fertility-related apps that provide information and support to both men and women undergoing fertility treatment; however,, none have documented their development and evaluation process.
34636741#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to describe the development and evaluation process of a bilingual mHealth app,, Infotility,, designed to meet the psychoeducational and psychosocial support needs of men and women undergoing fertility treatment.
34636741#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To develop the Infotility app,, we adhered to the Medical Research Council guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. First,, we conducted literature reviews and needs assessment surveys of fertility patients and health care providers who informed the content and design of the app. Second,, we tested the intervention with a small group of end users who provided feedback on the design and appropriateness of the app's content. Third,, we evaluated the uptake and usability of the app using a pre-post study design. Finally,, we updated the app's content based on participants' feedback and searched for partners to disseminate the app to the broader public.
34636741#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This study is the first to describe the development and evaluation process of an mHealth app for men and women undergoing fertility treatment. The app met its goal in providing fertility patients with a clinician-approved,, portable resource for reliable information about medical and psychosocial aspects of infertility and its treatments and a confidential peer support forum monitored by trained peer supporters. Participants rated the engagement,, functionality,, information,, and esthetics of the app positively,, with an overall app quality mean score of 3.75 (SD 0.53) and a star rating of 3.43 (SD 0.75),, with a total possible score and star rating of 5.00.
34636741#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#By documenting the systematic development and evaluation of the mHealth app for men and women undergoing fertility treatment,, this paper can facilitate the replication of the study intervention and the development of similar mHealth apps.

9322634#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our purpose was to establish whether obstetric ultrasonography interpreted by a live video telemedicine link is comparable to interpretation by videotape review in a low-risk patient population.
9322634#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#An Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN 6) was established from three satellite offices to our central prenatal diagnostic center. Patients seen at these satellite offices had a complete fetal anatomic survey recorded onto videotape by a trained ultrasonographer. A live interactive video telemedicine link was then established to our center by the digital network,, and a perinatologist directed the ultrasonographer through the anatomy survey. Subsequently a different perinatologist,, blinded to the telemedicine interpretation,, reviewed the videotaped examination. The reports from the videotaped and telemedicine scans were then compared on the basis of a score of 33 anatomic items.
9322634#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The first 200 patients seen at the satellite offices were included. Telemedicine and videotape interpretations provided similar scores in 84% of scans. In 17 of the 33 anatomic categories telemedicine provided significantly better scores than videotape,, whereas in the remaining 16 anatomic categories the scores were equivalent. More videotape than telemedicine examinations required repeat ultrasonography because of suboptimal imaging (10% vs 3%,, p = 0.003).
9322634#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The interpretation of obstetric ultrasonography with use of live video telemedicine is comparable to videotape review. Fetal telemedicine may prove to be a useful tool for providing ultrasonographic interpretation of fetal anatomy to a network of low-risk obstetric practices.

29425637#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global burden largely resulting from acute exacerbations. We investigated whether the incidences of patient and population exacerbations contain predictive information for continuous prediction of exacerbations in COPD patients.
29425637#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data analysis was performed using home measurements from 1225 patients included in the large-scale telehomecare trial TeleCare North,, where data supported 84 exacerbations occurring in 57 patients. Twenty-nine predictors were extracted and validated in two prediction models based on logistic regression. One model without and one model with inclusion of patient and population exacerbation incidences as potential predictors. The predictors were then evaluated by discriminative abilities between periods with and without exacerbation.
29425637#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The optimal predictor combinations provided an average area under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.63 with exclusion; inclusion of the population exacerbation incidence provided a curve of 0.74 (p?<?0.05). These results were based on a two-fold patient dependent cross-validation.
29425637#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The present study has presented how the population exacerbation incidence contains predictive information in the continuous prediction of exacerbations in COPD patients. A system capable of predicting acute exacerbations could potentially prevent some cases of COPD-related complications and increase the health-related quality of life among COPD patients in telecare.

26105725#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are a standard means of sudden cardiac death prevention. Compared with ambulatory visits,, remote monitoring (RM) of ICD recipients has improved the quality of health care and spared its resources. Few studies have addressed the organization of RM. We optimized and validated our institutional model of RM organization for ICD recipients.
26105725#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#This observational study of 562 ICD recipients compared 2 RM periods consisting of iterative,, qualitative,, and quantitative (1) device diagnostic evaluations by nurses and cardiologists; and (2) selected decisional trees. The main study end points were the professional interventions prompted by,, and times allocated to,, RM alerts. During the first period,, 1134 alerts occurred in 427 patients (286 patient-year),, of which 376 (33%) were submitted to cardiologists' reviews,, compared with,, 1522 alerts in 562 patients (458 patient-year),, of which 273 (18%) were submitted to cardiologists' reviews during the second period (P<0.001). An intervention was prompted by 73 of 376 (19.4%) alerts in the first versus 77 of 273 (28.2%) in the second period (P=0.009). The mean time to manage an alert was 4 minutes 31 s in the first versus 2 minutes 10 s in the second period (P<0.001). The annual numbers of alert-related hospitalizations were 10.8 versus 8.1 per 100-patient-year (P=0.230),, and annual numbers of alert-related visits were 9.8 and 6.1 per 100-patient-year (P=0.081),, respectively.
26105725#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#An optimized RM organization based on automated alerts and decisional trees enabled a focus on clinically relevant events and a decrease in the consumption of resources without compromising the quality of ICD recipients' care.

28550008#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Establishing a validated scale of patient engagement through use of information technology (ie,, digital patient engagement) is the first step to understanding its role in health and health care quality,, outcomes,, and efficient implementation by health care providers and systems.
28550008#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop and prioritize measures of digital patient engagement based on patients' use of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s MyHealtheVet (MHV) portal,, focusing on the MHV/Blue Button and Secure Messaging functions.
28550008#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We aligned two models from the information systems and organizational behavior literatures to create a theory-based model of digital patient engagement. On the basis of this model,, we conducted ten key informant interviews to identify potential measures from existing VA studies and consolidated the measures. We then conducted three rounds of modified Delphi rating by 12 national eHealth experts via Web-based surveys to prioritize the measures.
28550008#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#All 12 experts completed the study's three rounds of modified Delphi ratings,, resulting in two sets of final candidate measures representing digital patient engagement for Secure Messaging (58 measures) and MHV/Blue Button (71 measures). These measure sets map to Donabedian's three types of quality measures: (1) antecedents (eg,, patient demographics); (2) processes (eg,, a novel measure of Web-based care quality); and (3) outcomes (eg,, patient engagement).
28550008#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This national expert panel study using a modified Delphi technique prioritized candidate measures to assess digital patient engagement through patients' use of VA's My HealtheVet portal. The process yielded two robust measures sets prepared for future piloting and validation in surveys among Veterans.

31746772#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The role of online health communities (OHCs) in patient empowerment is growing and has been increasingly studied in recent years. Research has focused primarily on individualistic conception of patients' empowerment,, with much less attention paid to the role of OHCs in the development of patients' collective empowerment. Although OHCs have immense potential for empowerment that goes beyond the individual,, the concept and scale of collective empowerment in OHCs have not yet been developed or validated.
31746772#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to develop an instrument for measuring collective empowerment in online health communities (CE-OHC) and to test its quality by investigating its factorial structure,, reliability,, construct validity,, and predictive validity.

31746772#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The CE-OHC scale was developed according to a strict methodology for developing valid and reliable scales. An initial set of 20 items was first tested in the pilot study conducted in 2016 using a sample of 280 registered users of Slovenia's largest OHC. A refined version with 11 items was tested in the main study conducted in 2018 on a random sample of 30,,000 registered users of the same OHC. The final sample comprised 784 users. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to investigate the factorial structure,, discriminant validity,, and convergent validity of the scale. Cronbach alpha coefficient was used to determine the CE-OHC scale's internal consistency. To establish the predictive validity,, ordinary least squares regression was performed to test the role of CE-OHC in users' civic participation.
31746772#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The EFA resulted in a two-factor solution,, and the two factors-knowledge of resources and resource mobilization for collective action-together explain 63.8% of the variance. The second-order CFA demonstrated a good fit to the data (root mean square error of approximation=0.07) and the scale had a good internal consistency (alpha=.86). Although evidence of the scale's convergent validity was partially provided,, discriminant validity of the scale remained unconfirmed. Overall,, CE-OHC was confirmed to be a predictor of users' civic participation,, but the influence was somewhat weak and inconsistent across two subscales.
31746772#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed CE-OHC scale is a reliable and relatively valid instrument and serves as a good baseline to advance the measurement of collective empowerment in OHC contexts. This is the first scale developed for this purpose,, and future research should focus on the development of a clear nomological network of the collective empowerment construct in relation to the OHC settings.

25801649#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#To clarify whether a new portable imaging device (PID) providing 3D images for telemedical use constitutes a more correct expression of the clinical situation compared to standard telemedical equipment in this case iPhone 4s.
25801649#ABSTRACT#METHOD#We investigated intra- and interindividual variability between the new portable camera and the iPhone images vs. clinical assessment as the 'gold standard'. The study included 36 foot ulcers. Four specialists rated the ulcers and filled out a questionnaire,, which formed the basis of the evaluation.
25801649#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We found fair to very good intra-rater agreement for the new PID and iPhone,, respectively. The gold standard was evaluated by assessing the ulcer twice by two different specialists. Kappa values were moderate to very good with respect to inter-rater agreement except for two variables. The agreement between standard and new equipment compared to the gold standard showed highest agreement with the new PID.
25801649#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The new PID is more in accordance with the clinical assessment compared to standard images. It opens for the possibility of using more advanced techniques in a telemedical approach to ulcer treatment and care,, including volume measurements.

27619783#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this study was to compare a novel wireless phone and web based technology to record and store overactive bladder symptoms (OAB-S) to a traditional pen and paper micturition chart.
27619783#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Overactive bladder symptoms were recorded over a period of 3 days using both an electronic micturition chart (EMC) and the standard pen and paper micturition chart (MC). Twenty-nine men,, with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS),, were included in the study. Dropout rate,, patient's preference,, and correlation between the quality of life measures (QoL) and symptoms recorded with EMC versus MC,, were assessed and compared.
27619783#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the total number of 29 patients enrolled into the study,, 24 completed the full 3-day trial using MC and 27 using EMC. MC was preferred by 50%,, while EMC was preferred by 50% of participants. Using MC,, 21% of patients forgot to record at least one episode of urgency,, versus 17% using EMC,, 17% forgot to record at least one micturition using MC versus 8% using EMC. A statistically significant correlation was found between lower severity of OAB-S and higher QoL,, using both recording methods.
27619783#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In this study population,, recording symptoms with EMC did not prove to be preferable compared to MC; however,, EMC provided the same level of accuracy with the same or better adherence to the study protocol.

30973342#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#After a mobile health (mHealth) app is created,, an important step is to evaluate the usability of the app before it is released to the public. There are multiple ways of conducting a usability study,, one of which is collecting target users' feedback with a usability questionnaire. Different groups have used different questionnaires for mHealth app usability evaluation: The commonly used questionnaires are the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). However,, the SUS and PSSUQ were not designed to evaluate the usability of mHealth apps. Self-written questionnaires are also commonly used for evaluation of mHealth app usability but they have not been validated.
30973342#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this project was to develop and validate a new mHealth app usability questionnaire.
30973342#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An mHealth app usability questionnaire (MAUQ) was designed by the research team based on a number of existing questionnaires used in previous mobile app usability studies,, especially the well-validated questionnaires. MAUQ,, SUS,, and PSSUQ were then used to evaluate the usability of two mHealth apps: an interactive mHealth app and a standalone mHealth app. The reliability and validity of the new questionnaire were evaluated. The correlation coefficients among MAUQ,, SUS,, and PSSUQ were calculated.
30973342#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In this study,, 128 study participants provided responses to the questionnaire statements. Psychometric analysis indicated that the MAUQ has three subscales and their internal consistency reliability is high. The relevant subscales correlated well with the subscales of the PSSUQ. The overall scale also strongly correlated with the PSSUQ and SUS. Four versions of the MAUQ were created in relation to the type of app (interactive or standalone) and target user of the app (patient or provider). A website has been created to make it convenient for mHealth app developers to use this new questionnaire in order to assess the usability of their mHealth apps.
30973342#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The newly created mHealth app usability questionnaire-MAUQ-has the reliability and validity required to assess mHealth app usability.

37430519#ABSTRACT##Accurate measurement of sedentary behaviour in older adults is informative and relevant. Yet,, activities such as sitting are not accurately distinguished from non-sedentary activities (e.g.,, upright activities),, especially in real-world conditions. This study examines the accuracy of a novel algorithm to identify sitting,, lying,, and upright activities in community-dwelling older people in real-world conditions. Eighteen older adults wore a single triaxial accelerometer with an onboard triaxial gyroscope on their lower back and performed a range of scripted and non-scripted activities in their homes/retirement villages whilst being videoed. A novel algorithm was developed to identify sitting,, lying,, and upright activities. The algorithm's sensitivity,, specificity,, positive predictive value,, and negative predictive value for identifying scripted sitting activities ranged from 76.9% to 94.8%. For scripted lying activities: 70.4% to 95.7%. For scripted upright activities: 75.9% to 93.1%. For non-scripted sitting activities: 92.3% to 99.5%. No non-scripted lying activities were captured. For non-scripted upright activities: 94.3% to 99.5%. The algorithm could,, at worst,, overestimate or underestimate sedentary behaviour bouts by ±40 s,, which is within a 5% error for sedentary behaviour bouts. These results indicate good to excellent agreement for the novel algorithm,, providing a valid measure of sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling older adults.

34600498#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#During the COVID-19 pandemic,, multiple countries have taken measures,, such as isolation and quarantine,, to prevent person-to-person spread of disease. These actions forced many physicians to adopt new techniques,, such as telemedicine,, to continue patient care,, which has proven to be useful in continued care for those with non-COVID-19 pathologies. Various factors,, such as security,, confidentiality,, cost-effectiveness,, comfort,, and the risk of malpractice,, influence the perception of telemedicine among medical practitioners. The aim of this study was to adapt an existing instrument and validate it into a new Spanish version. The instrument is about the perceptions and knowledge of telemedicine in healthcare professionals.
34600498#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The original questionnaire surveyed 6 domains with 40 questions,, and each question was measured with a five-point Likert scale ranging from very high [5] to very low [1]. The survey was translated to Spanish using machine translation. The translation was reviewed independently,, and then,, a consensus was achieved regarding minor changes in the syntax of the survey to facilitate understanding. After expert feedback and questionnaire review,, the research team members proposed reducing the instrument to 13 items in 4 domains due to the similarity of some questions. The sample was divided into 2randomly selected groups. Eligibility criteria included physicians providing private or public services with active medical/clinical practice.
34600498#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 382 surveys were collected and separated into two random samples,, S1 and S2 (198 and 184,, respectively). In exploratory factor analysis (EFA),, the 13 items were grouped into four theoretical domains,, and item 7 presented cross loading between factors and was removed. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the scale reliability and interscale associations; three models were tested. Global Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was 0.76 for the EFA. The goodness of fit measures root mean square error of approximation and comparative fit index were 0.009 and 0.999,, respectively,, for the best model.
34600498#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The translated instrument was clear,, with adequate internal consistency,, readability,, and appropriate for application in the physician setting. This validated questionnaire made it possible to evaluate physicians' knowledge of telemedicine to increase its use,, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

34713033#ABSTRACT##In the context of the fourth revolution in healthcare technologies,, leveraging monitoring and personalization across different domains becomes a key factor for providing useful services to maintain and promote well-being. This is even more crucial for older people,, with aging being a complex multi-dimensional and multi-factorial process which can lead to frailty. The NESTORE project was recently funded by the EU Commission with the aim of supporting healthy older people to sustain their well-being and capacity to live independently. It is based on a multi-dimensional model of the healthy aging process that covers physical activity,, nutrition,, cognition,, and social activity. NESTORE is based on the paradigm of the human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system that,, exploiting the availability of Internet of Things technologies combined with analytics in the cloud,, provides a virtual coaching system to support healthy aging. This work describes the design of the NESTORE methodology and its IoT architecture. We first model the end-user under several domains,, then we present the NESTORE system that,, analyzing relevant key-markers,, provides coaching activities and personalized feedback to the user. Finally,, we describe the validation strategy to assess the effectiveness of NESTORE as a coaching platform for healthy aging.

36760786#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Roadmap mobile health (mHealth) app was developed to provide health-related quality of life (HRQOL) support for family caregivers of patients with cancer.
36760786#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Eligibility included: family caregivers (age =18 years) who self-reported as the primary caregiver of their pediatric patient with cancer; patients (age =5 years) who were receiving cancer care at the University of Michigan. Feasibility was calculated as the percentage of caregivers who logged into ONC Roadmap and engaged with it at least twice weekly for at least 50% of the 120-day study duration. Feasibility and acceptability was also assessed through a Feasibility and Acceptability questionnaire and the Mobile App Rating Scale to specifically assess app-quality. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to assess HRQOL self- or parent proxy assessments and physiological data capture.
36760786#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Between September 2020-September 2021,, 100 participants (or 50 caregiver-patient dyads) consented and enrolled in the ONC Roadmap study for 120-days. Feasibility of the study was met,, wherein the majority of caregivers (N=32; 65%) logged into ONC Roadmap and engaged with it at least twice weekly for at least 50% of the study duration (defined a priori in the Protocol). The Feasibility and Acceptability questionnaire responses indicated that the study was feasible and acceptable with the majority (>50%) reporting Agree or Strongly Agree with positive Net Favorability [(Agree + Strongly Agree) - (Disagree + Totally Disagree)] in each of the domains (e.g.,, Fitbit use,, ONC Roadmap use,, completing longitudinal assessments,, engaging in similar future study,, study expectations). Improvements were seen across the majority of the mental HRQOL domains across all groups; even though underpowered,, there were significant improvements in caregiver-specific aspects of HRQOL and anxiety and in depression and fatigue for children (ages 8-17 years),, and a trend toward improvement in depression for children ages 8-17 years and in fatigue for adult patients.
36760786#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study supports that mHealth technology may be a promising platform to provide HRQOL support for caregivers of pediatric patients with cancer. Importantly,, the findings suggest that the study protocol was feasible,, and participants were favorable to participate in future studies of this intervention alongside routine cancer care delivery.

19797150#ABSTRACT#AIMS#Electrocardiographic changes,, e.g. arrhythmias causing syncope or palpitations,, are often transient and therefore difficult to diagnose. Systematic and symptom-activated ECG recordings can increase diagnostic yield in such patients. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a simple,, leadless,, patient-operated ECG device compared with a standard 12-lead ECG.
19797150#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#We recorded a standard 12-lead surface ECG and a patient-activated ECG in direct succession in 508 consecutive patients enrolled in four centres. All ECGs were analysed by a single,, blinded observer. ECGs were analysable in 505 (99.4%) patients (66% male,, age 61 +/- 15 years,, and body mass index 27 +/- 4). Analysis of the patient-activated ECG adequately detected a normal ECG (sensitivity 91% and specificity 95%),, atrial fibrillation (AF) (sensitivity 99% and specificity 96%),, and even T-wave abnormalities (sensitivity 90% and specificity 75%). Diagnostic accuracy for atrioventricular nodal block was moderate (sensitivity 79% and specificity 99%). Continuous parameters correlated well: (r(2) = 0.89 for heart rate,, 0.83 for PR interval,, 0.78 for QRS duration,, and 0.89 for QTc).
19797150#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Recordings made by this patient-operated ECG device allow to detect arrhythmias and other ECG changes with high accuracy compared with a standard ECG. It may help to improve accurate diagnosis of transient ECG changes such as paroxysmal AF in palpitations or other unexplained cardiac symptoms.

35711572#ABSTRACT##A healthy diet during pregnancy has been associated with beneficial child and maternal health outcomes but is challenging to achieve. Recent technological advances offer new opportunities to support pregnant women in their food choices-for instance,, via apps. This is already reflected by a wide availability of pregnancy-related apps,, but health care professionals feel unsure about their potential. Therefore,, the Dutch Google Play Store and Apple App Store were reviewed to identify existing apps on diet and pregnancy. App quality was assessed using the 1) Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS; i.e.,, assessing functionality,, aesthetics,, engagement,, information quality),, 2) Dutch dietary guidelines for pregnant women,, and 3) App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS). Fifty-seven unique apps were identified with an average star rating of 4.2 ±  0.6 and MARS quality score of 3.2 ±  0.3,, indicating a moderate quality. Most apps scored best in terms of functionality and aesthetics (4.0 ±  0.4 and 3.3 ±  0.6),, but lowest in terms of engagement (2.5 ±  0.6). Regarding nutrition information provision,, most apps were incomplete or deviated from the Dutch guidelines. Folic acid supplementation (91%),, hygiene (81%),, caffeine (79%),, and alcohol (77%) were the most commonly addressed nutrition aspects,, whereas licorice (11%),, iodine (19%),, and soy (18%) were only addressed in a few apps. Moreover,, a median of 2 out of 21 ABACUS behavior change items were identified per app,, which were predominantly related to the category "knowledge and information." Thus,, despite the abundance of apps supporting a healthy diet during pregnancy in the Dutch app stores,, there is an urgent need for apps with complete and scientifically sound dietary information that is supported by effective behavior change techniques.

23741134#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#Three hundred and nine diabetic patients underwent both the clinical slit lamp examination by a comprehensive ophthalmologist and teleglaucoma (TG) assessment by a glaucoma subspecialist. Both assessments were compared for any focal glaucoma damage; for TG,, the quality of photographs was assessed,, and vertical cup-to-disk ratio (VCDR) was calculated in a semi-automated manner. In patients with VCDR > 0.7,, the diagnostic precision of the Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) C-20 screening program was assessed.
23741134#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of 309 TG assessment photos,, 74 (24%) were deemed unreadable due to media opacities,, patient cooperation,, and unsatisfactory photographic technique. While the identification of individual optic nerve factors showed either fair or moderate agreement,, the ability to diagnose glaucoma based on the overall assessment showed moderate agreement (Kappa [?] statistic 0.55% and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-0.62). The use of FDT to detect glaucoma in the presence of disc damage (VCDR > 0.7) showed substantial agreement (? statistic of 0.84 and 95% CI 0.79-0.90). A positive TG diagnosis of glaucoma carried a 77.5% positive predictive value,, and a negative TG diagnosis carried an 82.2% negative predicative value relative to the clinical slit lamp examination.
23741134#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#There was moderate agreement between the ability to diagnose glaucoma using TG relative to clinical slit lamp examination. Poor quality photographs can severely limit the ability of TG assessment to diagnose optic nerve damage and glaucoma. Although further work and validation is needed,, the TG approach provides a novel,, and promising method to diagnose glaucoma,, a major cause of ocular morbidity throughout the world.

32871264#ABSTRACT#HYPOTHESIS/BACKGROUND#In 2017,, the American Orthopaedic Association advocated for the increased use of telehealth as an assessment and treatment platform,, and demand has significantly increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Diagnostic effectiveness (also called overall diagnostic accuracy) and reliability of a telehealth clinical examination vs. a traditional shoulder clinical examination (SCE) has not been established. Our objective is to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of a telehealth shoulder examination against an SCE for rotator cuff tear (RCT),, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a reference standard; secondary objectives included assessing agreement between test platforms and validity of individualized tests. We hypothesize that tests provided in a telehealth platform would not have inferior diagnostic effectiveness to an SCE.
32871264#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study is a case-based,, case-control design. Two clinicians selected movement,, strength,, and special tests for the SCE that are associated with the diagnosis of RCT and identified similar tests to replicate for a simulated telehealth-based examination (STE). Consecutive patients with no prior shoulder surgery or advanced imaging underwent both the SCE and STE in the same visit using 2 separate assessors. We randomized the order of the SCE or STE. A blinded reader assessed an MRI,, to be used as a reference standard. We calculated diagnostic effectiveness,, which provides values from 0% to 100% as well as agreement statistics (Kappa) between tests by an assessment platform,, and sensitivity,, specificity,, and likelihood ratios for individual tests in both SCE and STE. We compared the diagnostic effectiveness (overall) of the SCE and STE with a Mann-Whitney U test.
32871264#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We included 62 consecutive patients with shoulder pain,, aged 40 or older; 50 (81%) received an MRI as a reference standard. The diagnostic effectiveness of stand-alone tests was poor regardless of the group,, with the exception of a few tests with high specificity. None had greater than 70% accuracy. There was no significant difference between the overall diagnostic effectiveness of the STE and SCE (P = .98). Overall agreement between the STE tests and the SCE tests ranged from poor to moderate (Kappa,, 0.07-0.87).
32871264#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study identified initial feasibility and noninferiority of the physician-guided,, patient-performed STE when compared with an SCE in the detection of RCTs. Although these results are promising,, larger studies are needed for further validation of an STE assessment platform.

25660364#ABSTRACT##Smartphone-based medical applications (apps) can facilitate self-management of hypertension (HTN). The content and consumer interaction metrics of HTN-related apps are unknown. In this cross-sectional study to ascertain the content of medical apps designed for HTN management,, we queried Google Play and Apple iTunes using the search terms "hypertension" and "high blood pressure." The top 107 apps were analyzed. Major app functionalities including tracking (for blood pressure [BP],, pulse,, weight,, body mass index),, medical device (to measure pulse or BP),, general information on HTN,, and medication adherence tools were recorded along with consumer engagement parameters. Data were collected from May 28 to May 30,, 2014. A total of 72% of the apps had tracking function,, 22% had tools to enhance medication adherence,, 37% contained general information on HTN,, and 8% contained information on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. These data showed that a majority of apps for HTN are designed primarily for health management functions. However,, 14% of Google Android apps could transform the smartphone into a medical device to measure BP. None of these apps employed the use of a BP cuff or had any documentation of validation against a gold standard. Only 3% of the apps were developed by healthcare agencies such as universities or professional organizations. In regression models. the medical device function was highly predictive of greater number of downloads (odds ratio,, 97.08; P < .001) and positive consumer reviews (Incidence rate ratios,, 1204.39; P < .001). A large majority of medical apps designed for HTN serve health management functions such as tracking blood pressure,, weight,, or body mass index. Consumers have a strong tendency to download and favorably rate apps that are advertised to measure blood pressure and heart rate,, despite a lack of validation for these apps. There is a need for greater oversight in medical app development for HTN,, especially when they qualify as a medical device.

33838317#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Consumer devices with broad reach may be useful in screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in appropriate populations. However,, currently no consumer devices are capable of continuous monitoring for AF.
33838317#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a smartwatch algorithm for continuous detection of AF from sinus rhythm in a free-living setting.
33838317#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We studied a commercially available smartwatch with photoplethysmography (W-PPG) and electrocardiogram (W-ECG) capabilities. We validated a novel W-PPG algorithm combined with a W-ECG algorithm in a free-living setting,, and compared the results to those of a 28-day continuous ECG patch (P-ECG).
33838317#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 204 participants completed the free-living study,, recording 81,,944 hours with both P-ECG and smartwatch measurements. We found sensitivity of 87.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83.6%-91.0%) and specificity of 97.4% (95% CI 97.1%-97.7%) for the W-PPG algorithm (every 5-minute classification); sensitivity of 98.9% (95% CI 98.1%-99.4%) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI 99.1%-99.5%) for the W-ECG algorithm; and sensitivity of 96.9% (95% CI 93.7%-98.5%) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI 98.4%-99.7%) for W-PPG triggered W-ECG with a single W-ECG required for confirmation of AF. We found a very strong correlation of W-PPG in quantifying AF burden compared to P-ECG (r = 0.98).
33838317#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Our findings demonstrate that a novel algorithm using a commercially available smartwatch can continuously detect AF with excellent performance and that confirmation with W-ECG further enhances specificity. In addition,, our W-PPG algorithm can estimate AF burden. Further research is needed to determine whether this algorithm is useful in screening for AF in select at-risk patients.

23390209#ABSTRACT##We reviewed the use of telephone tests to identify cognitive impairment. We searched PubMed for epidemiological studies and clinical trials reporting the use of telephone tests to identify cognitive impairment. Validation studies and papers published more than 10 years ago were excluded. A total of 132 abstracts were identified,, from which 19 epidemiological studies and four clinical trials were selected. Telephone tests were found to reduce selection bias in epidemiology by including people over large areas and facilitating follow-up in longitudinal studies. The most widely used tests were the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and its modified version,, the TICSm. Interviewing a proxy was included in most of the studies to compensate for the unavailability of some participants because of deafness,, disease or death. In the epidemiological studies,, results of telephone tests were seldom confirmed by a medical examination. Telephone screening for cognitive impairment to identify individuals eligible for clinical trials is impeded by low efficiency and lack of sensitivity for separating early pathological cognitive impairment from dementia and normal ageing.
28157404#ABSTRACT##Whole slide imaging (WSI) offers a convenient,, tractable platform for measuring features of routine and special-stain histology or in immunohistochemistry staining by using digital image analysis (IA). We now routinely use IA for quantitative and qualitative analysis of theranostic markers such as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2/neu),, estrogen and progesterone receptors,, and Ki-67. Quantitative IA requires extensive validation,, however,, and may not always be the best approach,, with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors being one example in which a semiautomated approach may be preferable for patient care. We find that IA has great utility for objective assessment of gastrointestinal tract dysplasia,, microvessel density in hepatocellular carcinoma,, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis,, renal fibrosis,, and general quality analysis/quality control,, although the applications of these to daily practice are still in development. Collaborations with bioinformatics specialists have explored novel applications to gliomas,, including in silico approaches for mining histologic data and correlating with molecular and radiologic findings. We and many others are using WSI for rapid,, remote-access slide reviews (telepathology),, though technical factors currently limit its utility for routine,, high-volume diagnostics. In our experience,, the greatest current practical impact of WSI lies in facilitating long-term storage and retrieval of images while obviating the need to keep slides on site. Once the existing barriers of capital cost,, validation,, operator training,, software design,, and storage/back-up concerns are overcome,, these technologies appear destined to be a cornerstone of precision medicine and personalized patient care,, and to become a routine part of pathology practice.

16627456#ABSTRACT##Appropriate and inappropriate therapies of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have a major impact on morbidity and quality of life in ICD recipients. The recently introduced home monitoring of ICD devices is a promising new technique which remotely offers information about the status of the system. Stored intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs),, which are essential for correct classification of appropriate and inappropriate ICD discharges,, have until now not been available with ICD home monitoring on a day-by-day basis because of limitations of transferable data. We demonstrate the first compressed IEGMs daily transferable via home monitoring (IEGM-online). Validation of these electrograms will be performed in the Reliability of IEGM-Online Interpretation (RIONI) study. A total of 210 episodes of stored IEGMs will be collected by at least 12 European centres. The primary endpoint of this study is to investigate whether the IEGM-online based evaluation of the appropriateness of the ICDs therapeutic decision following episode detection is equivalent to the evaluation based on the complete ICD episode Holter extracted from the IEGM stored. The evaluation is independently done by an expert board of three experienced ICD investigators. The equivalence of the two methods is accepted if the evaluations yield a different conclusion for <10% of all evaluated IEGMs. The conclusion of the study is expected at the beginning of 2007. If RIONI successfully validates IEGMs transmitted via home monitoring,, a strong basis for the use of this promising technique will be established.

34127936#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#Hypertension is common,, impacting an estimated 108 million US adults,, and deadly,, responsible for the deaths of one in six adults annually. Optimal management includes frequent blood pressure monitoring and antihypertensive medication titration,, but in the traditional office-based care delivery model,, patients have their blood pressure measured only intermittently and in a way that is subject to misdiagnosis with white coat or masked hypertension. There is a growing opportunity to leverage our expanding repository of digital technology to reimagine hypertension care delivery. This paper reviews existing and emerging digital tools available for hypertension management,, as well as behavioral economic insights that could supercharge their impact.
34127936#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#Digitally connected blood pressure monitors offer an alternative to office-based blood pressure monitoring. A number of cuffless blood pressure monitors are in development but require further validation before they can be deployed for widespread clinical use. Patient-facing hubs and applications offer a means to transmit blood pressure data to clinicians. Though artificial intelligence could allow for curation of this data,, its clinical use for hypertension remains limited to assessing risk factors at this time. Finally,, text-based and telemedicine platforms are increasingly being employed to translate hypertension data into clinical outcomes with promising results.

34127936#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#The digital management of hypertension shows potential as an avenue for increasing patient engagement and improving clinical efficiency and outcomes. It is important for clinicians to understand the benefits,, limitations,, and future directions of digital health to optimize management of hypertension.

30134777#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#People with Parkinson's disease experience numerous barriers to exercise participation at fitness facilities. Advances in tele-monitoring technologies create alternative channels for managing and supervising exercise programmes in the home. However,, the success of these programmes will depend on participants' perceptions of using the technology and their exercise adherence. Thus,, this pilot explored the uptake and implementation of two common methods of Internet-exercise training in Parkinson's disease.
30134777#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Twenty adults with Parkinson's disease were randomized into either: telecoach-assisted exercise (TAE) or self-regulated exercise (SRE) groups. Both groups received the same eight-week exercise prescription (combined strength and aerobic exercise) and telehealth system that streamed and recorded vital signs and exercise data. TAE participants exercised under a telecoach's supervision via videoconferencing. SRE participants independently managed their exercise training. Quantitative data were described and qualitative data underwent thematic analysis.
30134777#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Quantitative results demonstrated that TAE participants achieved strong attendance (99.2%),, whereas SRE participants demonstrated 35.9% lower attendance,, 48% less total time exercising,, and 74.5% less time exercising at moderate intensity. Qualitatively,, TAE participants reported overtly favourable programme experiences and that assistance from a telecoach enhanced their exercise motivation. SRE participants noted several challenges that impeded adherence.
30134777#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Findings demonstrate that adults with Parkinson's disease acknowledge benefits of exercising through a telehealth system and are open to utilizing this channel as a means of exercise. However,, human-interactive support may be required to overcome unique impediments to participation. Study findings warrant validation in larger trials that can transfer the success of TAE towards more scalable methods of delivery.

37017471#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The increasing use of activity trackers in mobile health studies to passively collect physical data has shown promise in lessening participation burden to provide actively contributed patient-reported outcome (PRO) information.
37017471#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models to classify and predict PRO scores using Fitbit data from a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
37017471#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two different models were built to classify PRO scores: a random forest classifier model that treated each week of observations independently when making weekly predictions of PRO scores,, and a hidden Markov model that additionally took correlations between successive weeks into account. Analyses compared model evaluation metrics for (1) a binary task of distinguishing a normal PRO score from a severe PRO score and (2) a multiclass task of classifying a PRO score state for a given week.
37017471#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#For both the binary and multiclass tasks,, the hidden Markov model significantly (P<.05) outperformed the random forest model for all PRO scores,, and the highest area under the curve,, Pearson correlation coefficient,, and Cohen ? coefficient were 0.750,, 0.479,, and 0.471,, respectively.
37017471#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#While further validation of our results and evaluation in a real-world setting remains,, this study demonstrates the ability of physical activity tracker data to classify health status over time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and enables the possibility of scheduling preventive clinical interventions as needed. If patient outcomes can be monitored in real time,, there is potential to improve clinical care for patients with other chronic conditions.

31909908#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#Correctly identifying patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on first contact is essential,, yet emergency dispatchers currently lack a risk scale that can help predict an ACS diagnosis. Our main aim was to develop and validate such a risk scale.
31909908#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#Prospective,, observational single-center study in 2016 (January 1 to December 31). We included patients who called our emergency dispatch center to report nontraumatic chest pain. Included patients were randomly assigned to a development or a validation sample. The predictive SCARE scale was built with logistic regression analysis. Discrimination and calibration were analyzed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
31909908#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The development sample included 902 patients. The regression model identified 7 variables associated with a final diagnosis of ACS: male sex,, age,, smoking,, typical pain characteristics,, first episode of chest pain,, diaphoresis,, and physician intuition (the teledispatcher's suspicion). When we applied the scale in the validation sample of 465 patients the area under the curve was 0.81 (95% CI,, 0.76-0.87). The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was 5.18 (P=.74).
31909908#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The SCARE scale had good discrimination and calibration properties. The scale should be further validated in an external sample from a multicenter study before it is implemented by emergency dispatch centers.

18632327#ABSTRACT##Biomedical engineering research efforts have accomplished another level of a "technological solution" for diabetes: an artificial pancreas to be used by patients and supervised by healthcare professionals at any time and place. Reliability of continuous glucose monitoring,, availability of real-time programmable insulin pumps,, and validation of safe and efficient control algorithms are critical components for achieving that goal. Nevertheless,, the development and integration of these new technologies within a telemedicine system can be the basis of a future artificial pancreas. This paper introduces the concept,, design,, and evaluation of the "intelligent control assistant for diabetes,, INCA" system. INCA is a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based personal smart assistant to provide patients with closed-loop control strategies (personal and remote loop),, based on a real-time continuous glucose sensor (Guardian RT,, Medtronic),, an insulin pump (D-TRON,, Disetronic Medical Systems),, and a mobile general packet radio service (GPRS)-based telemedicine communication system. Patient therapeutic decision making is supervised by doctors through a multiaccess telemedicine central server that provides to diabetics and doctors a Web-based access to continuous glucose monitoring and insulin infusion data. The INCA system has been technically and clinically evaluated in two randomized and crossover clinical trials showing an improvement on glycaemic control of diabetic patients.
33315725#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#Literature from the review period includes case series demonstrating the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the conjunctival secretions of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The global ophthalmology community published reports outlining the enhanced infection control measures undertaken by different institutions around the world to mitigate transmission of the novel coronavirus. Telemedicine has been increasingly implemented in glaucoma practices to reduce in-office patient volume. New data regarding the efficacy and feasibility of tools for home monitoring of intraocular pressure,, virtual visual field testing,, and remote disc photography are reviewed.
33315725#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#COVID-19 has posed a global public health threat due to the severity of its contagion and associated morbidity and mortality. Glaucoma specialists have responded to the pandemic with innovative modifications to reduce viral transmission and optimize patient and staff safety in the office and operating room. The role of teleglaucoma has expanded and will continue to evolve as remote diagnostic devices undergo further refinement and validation.

17022841#ABSTRACT##A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was transmitted to a call centre via telephone (tele-ECG). In 120 patients (mean age 64 years) referred to hospitals because of ACS,, a standard 12-lead ECG and a tele-ECG recorded at the same time were compared by two cardiologists and one internist independently and blindly. Conduction times exhibited very good agreement between standard and tele-ECG with reliability coefficients (R) of 0.91,, 0.86 and 0.89 for the PQ-,, QRS- and QT interval,, respectively. Rhythm analysis was correct in 99% of the cases. Negative T waves,, ST-segment elevation and depression were detected with very high agreement in the tele-ECG exhibiting kappa (kappa) coefficients between 0.75 and 0.96. The correct ECG diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was possible with excellent agreement between standard and tele-ECG,, showing kappa coefficients of 0.96,, 0.99 and 0.99,, respectively,, for three investigators. The 12-lead tele-ECG recorder proved accurate for the detection of acute STEMI.

29914863#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A large number of people participate in individual or unorganized sports on a recreational level. Furthermore,, many participants drop out because of injury or lowered motivation. Potentially,, physical activity-related apps could motivate people during sport participation and help them to follow and maintain a healthy active lifestyle. It remains unclear what the quality of running,, cycling,, and walking apps is and how it can be assessed. Quality of these apps was defined as having a positive influence on participation in recreational sports. This information will show which features need to be assessed when rating physical activity-related app quality.

29914863#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data were gathered via an expert panel approach using the nominal group technique. Two expert panels were organized to identify and rank app features relevant for sport participation. Experts were researchers or professionals in the field of industrial design and information technology (technology expert panel) and in the field of behavior change,, health,, and human movement sciences who had affinity with physical activity-related apps (health science expert panel). Of the 24 experts who were approached,, 11 (46%) agreed to participate. Each panel session consisted of three consultation rounds. The 10 most important features per expert were collected. We calculated the frequency of the top 10 features and the mean importance score per feature (0-100). The sessions were taped and transcribed verbatim; a thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data.
29914863#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the technology expert panel,, applied feedback and feedforward (91.3) and fun (91.3) were found most important (scale 0-100). Together with flexibility and look and feel,, these features were mentioned most often (all n=4 [number of experts]; importance scores=41.3 and 43.8,, respectively). The experts in the health science expert panels a and b found instructional feedback (95.0),, motivating or challenging (95.0),, peer rating and use (92.0),, motivating feedback (91.3),, and monitoring or statistics (91.0) most important. Most often ranked features were monitoring or statistics,, motivating feedback,, works good technically,, tailoring starting point,, fun,, usability anticipating or context awareness,, and privacy (all n=3-4 [number of experts]; importance scores=16.7-95.0). The qualitative analysis resulted in four overarching themes: (1) combination behavior change,, technical,, and design features needed; (2) extended feedback and tailoring is advised; (3) theoretical or evidence base as standard; and (4) entry requirements related to app use.
18002833#ABSTRACT##The hand rehabilitation process needs a continuous and frequent monitoring of the patient's functionality in order to test the delivered therapy and/or adapt it to the patient's progress. In order to contain costs for the rehabilitation program,, a tele-homecare rehabilitation system is suitable. We have proposed a tele-home-care allowing the assessment of the hand fingers' dynamics and kinematics by integrating with a dedicated software two particular devices: the first was a commercial glove,, the HumanGlove by Humanware (Pisa,, Italy) and the second was a set of instruments for the measurement of the hand fingers' force comprehending an Instrumented Keyboard (IK) and an Instrumented Mouse-Like (IML) device. The platform has been successfully tested at Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS).

25972226#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The potential benefits of the introduction of electronic and mobile health (mHealth) information technologies,, to support the safe delivery of intravenous chemotherapy or oral anticancer therapies,, could be exponential in the context of a highly integrated computerized system.
25972226#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Here we describe a safe therapy mobile (STM) system for the safe delivery of intravenous chemotherapy,, and a home monitoring system for monitoring and managing toxicity and improving adherence in patients receiving oral anticancer therapies at home.
25972226#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The STM system is fully integrated with the electronic oncological patient record. After the prescription of chemotherapy,, specific barcodes are automatically associated with the patient and each drug,, and a bedside barcode reader checks the patient,, nurse,, infusion bag,, and drug sequence in order to trace the entire administration process,, which is then entered in the patient's record. The usability and acceptability of the system was investigated by means of a modified questionnaire administered to nurses. The home monitoring system consists of a mobile phone or tablet diary app,, which allows patients to record their state of health,, the medications taken,, their side effects,, and a Web dashboard that allows health professionals to check the patient data and monitor toxicity and treatment adherence. A built-in rule-based alarm module notifies health care professionals of critical conditions. Initially developed for chronic patients,, the system has been subsequently customized in order to monitor home treatments with capecitabine or sunitinib in cancer patients (Onco-TreC).
25972226#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The STM system never failed to match the patient/nurse/drug sequence association correctly,, and proved to be accurate and reliable in tracing and recording the entire administration process. The questionnaires revealed that the users were generally satisfied and had a positive perception of the system's usefulness and ease of use,, and the quality of their working lives. The pilot studies with the home monitoring system with 43 chronic patients have shown that the approach is reliable and useful for clinicians and patients,, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the expectations that mHealth solutions may raise in users. The Onco-TreC version has been successfully laboratory tested,, and is now ready for validation.

14728766#ABSTRACT##We have conducted a preliminary validation of an Internet-based telehealth application for assessing motor speech disorders in adults with acquired neurological impairment. The videoconferencing module used NetMeeting software to provide realtime videoconferencing through a 128 kbit/s Internet link,, as well as the transfer of store-and-forward video and audio data from the participant to the clinician. Ten participants with dysarthria following acquired brain injury were included in the study. An assessment of the overall severity of the speech disturbance was made for each participant face to face (FTF) and in the online environment; in addition,, a 23-item version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA) (which measures motor speech function) and the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (ASSIDS) (which gives the percentage word and sentence intelligibility,, words per minute and a rating of communication efficiency) were administered in both environments. There was a 90% level of agreement between the two assessment environments for the rating of overall severity of dysarthria. A 70-100% level of agreement was achieved for 17 (74%) of the 23 FDA variables. On the ASSIDS there was a significant difference between the FTF and online assessments only for percentage word intelligibility. These findings suggest that Internet-based assessment has potential as a reliable method for assessing motor speech disorders.

22113981#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the recent advances in catheter design and technology,, intra-cardiac navigation during electrophysiology procedures remains challenging. Incorporation of imaging along with magnetic or robotic guidance may improve navigation accuracy and procedural safety. In the present study,, the in vivo performance of a novel remote controlled Robot Assisted Cardiac Navigation System (RACN) was evaluated in a porcine model.
22113981#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The navigation catheter and target sensor were advanced to the right atrium using fluoroscopic and intra-cardiac echo guidance. The target sensor was positioned at three target locations in the right atrium (RA) and the navigation task was completed by an experienced physician using both manual and RACN guidance. The navigation time,, final distance between the catheter tip and target sensor,, and variability in final catheter tip position were determined and compared for manual and RACN guided navigation.
22113981#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the RACN system for cardiac navigation. The results demonstrated that RACN performed comparably with manual navigation,, with improved precision and consistency for targets located in and near the right atrial chamber.

22113981#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The experiments were completed in three animals and five measurements recorded for each target location. The mean distance (mm) between catheter tip and target sensor at the end of the navigation task was significantly less using RACN guidance compared with manual navigation (5.02?±?0.31 vs. 9.66?±?2.88,, p?=?0.050 for high RA,, 9.19?±?1.13 vs. 13.0?±?1.00,, p?=?0.011 for low RA and 6.77?±?0.59 vs. 15.66?±?2.51,, p?=?0.003 for tricuspid valve annulus). The average time (s) needed to complete the navigation task was significantly longer by RACN guided navigation compared with manual navigation (43.31?±?18.19 vs. 13.54?±?1.36,, p?=?0.047 for high RA,, 43.71?±?11.93 vs. 22.71?±?3.79,, p?=?0.043 for low RA and 37.84?±?3.71 vs. 16.13?±?4.92,, p?=?0.003 for tricuspid valve annulus. RACN guided navigation resulted in greater consistency in performance compared with manual navigation as evidenced by lower variability in final distance measurements (0.41 vs. 0.99?mm,, p?=?0.04).
31068063#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Studies have demonstrated the high agreement of several remote neuropsychological tests using video teleconferencing (VTC) with face-to-face (FTF) tests. However,, the reliability of the remotely administered Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog),, one of the most commonly used neuropsychological tests to detect cognitive decline,, has not been substantially elucidated,, particularly in Japanese populations. Therefore,, this study aimed to evaluate the reliability of the remotely administered ADAS-cog compared with FTF-administered ADAS-cog among elderly Japanese participants.
31068063#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants aged =60 years with and without cognitive impairment,, i.e. those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),, those with dementia and healthy controls (HCs),, were assessed with the ADAS-cog using VTC and FTF testing at an interval of >2 weeks and <3 months. The assessment order (VTC or FTF) was randomized by participants. Participants' scores were compared among the entire sample,, as well as subgroups,, using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) in a mixed-effects model.
31068063#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 73 participants were included in the study (36 men; age,, 76.3?±?7.6 years). The ICC for the ADAS-cog total score was high in the entire sample (0.86),, whereas ICCs were moderate to high for the subgroups (MCI: 0.63,, dementia: 0.80 and HC: 0.74).
31068063#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The results indicate that a VTC-administered ADAS-cog could be an alternative for an FTF-administered ADAS-cog,, although further replication studies with larger sample sizes and a wider range of cognitive functionalities are warranted.

31951218#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Tools for app- and Web-based self-testing for identification of cognitive impairment are widely available but are of uncertain quality.
31951218#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to undertake a scoping review of app- and Web-based self-tests for cognitive impairment and determine the validity of these tests.
31951218#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted systematic searches in electronic databases,, including Google search,, Google Play Store,, and iPhone Operating System App Store,, using the search terms "Online OR Internet-based AND Memory OR Brain OR Dementia OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI AND Test OR Screen OR Check."
31951218#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified 3057 tools,, of which 25 were included in the review. Most tools meeting the inclusion criteria assessed multiple cognitive domains. The most frequently assessed domains were memory,, attention,, and executive function. We then conducted an electronic survey with the developers of the tools to identify data relating to development and validation of each tool. If no response to the survey was received,, Google (to identify gray literature),, Google Scholar,, and Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online were searched using key terms "(name of developer,, if available)" AND "(the name of the tool)" to identify any additional data. Only 7 tools had any information concerning psychometric quality,, and only 1 tool reported data on performance norms,, reliability,, validity,, sensitivity,, and specificity for the detection of cognitive impairment.
31951218#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The number of cognitive self-assessment electronic health tools for cognitive impairment is increasing,, but most are of uncertain quality. There is a need for well-validated tools and guidance for users concerning which tools provide reliable information about possible cognitive impairment that could warrant further investigation.

32871294#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Severe pharyngitis is frequently associated with inflammations caused by streptococcal pharyngitis,, which can cause immune-mediated and post-infectious complications. The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study,, therefore,, purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images.
32871294#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier,, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50,, Inception-v3,, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
32871294#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The CycleGAN-based synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images,, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50,, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992,, respectively.
32871294#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19,, this framework will help patients with upper respiratory symptoms to improve convenience in diagnosis and reduce transmission.

32384737#ABSTRACT##Significant attention has been paid to the accurate detection of diabetes. It is a big challenge for the research community to develop a diagnosis system to detect diabetes in a successful way in the e-healthcare environment. Machine learning techniques have an emerging role in healthcare services by delivering a system to analyze the medical data for diagnosis of diseases. The existing diagnosis systems have some drawbacks,, such as high computation time,, and low prediction accuracy. To handle these issues,, we have proposed a diagnosis system using machine learning methods for the detection of diabetes. The proposed method has been tested on the diabetes data set which is a clinical dataset designed from patient's clinical history. Further,, model validation methods,, such as hold out,, K-fold,, leave one subject out and performance evaluation metrics,, includes accuracy,, specificity,, sensitivity,, F1-score,, receiver operating characteristic curve,, and execution time have been used to check the validity of the proposed system. We have proposed a filter method based on the Decision Tree (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for highly important feature selection. Two ensemble learning algorithms,, Ada Boost and Random Forest,, are also used for feature selection and we also compared the classifier performance with wrapper based feature selection algorithms. Classifier Decision Tree has been used for the classification of healthy and diabetic subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed feature selection algorithm selected features improve the classification performance of the predictive model and achieved optimal accuracy. Additionally,, the proposed system performance is high compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. High performance of the proposed method is due to the different combinations of selected features set and Plasma glucose concentrations,, Diabetes pedigree function,, and Blood mass index are more significantly important features in the dataset for prediction of diabetes. Furthermore,, the experimental results statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed method would effectively detect diabetes and can be deployed in an e-healthcare environment.

25584516#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#We performed a structured review of the published literature regarding m-health in medical imaging using the Medline,, PubMed,, and Web of Science databases (January 2002-August 2013). The two authors independently extracted data regarding type of specialty,, purpose,, and study design of publications.
25584516#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 235 articles were identified. The majority of studies were case reports or noncomparative product validation studies. The greatest volume of publications originated in the fields of radiology (21%),, dermatology (15%),, laboratory techniques (15%),, and plastic surgery (12%). Among these studies,, m-health was used as diagnostic aids,, for patient monitoring,, and to improve communication between health practitioners. With the growing use of mobile phones for medical imaging,, considerations need to be given to informed consent,, privacy,, image storage and transfer,, and guidelines for healthcare workers and patients.
25584516#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There are several novel uses of mobile devices for medical imaging that show promise across a variety of areas and subspecialties of healthcare. Currently,, studies are mostly exploratory in nature. To validate these devices,, studies with higher methodological rigor are required.

29444787#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Hospital readmissions within 30?days are a healthcare quality problem associated with increased costs and poor health outcomes. Identifying interventions to improve patients' successful transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a continued challenge.
27586489#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Amin and Biswas recently proposed a RSA-based user authentication and session key agreement protocol usable for TMIS,, which is an improvement over Giri et al.'s RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS. In this paper,, we show that though Amin-Biswas's scheme considerably improves the security drawbacks of Giri et al.'s scheme,, their scheme has security weaknesses as it suffers from attacks such as privileged insider attack,, user impersonation attack,, replay attack and also offline password guessing attack. A new RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS is proposed,, which overcomes the security pitfalls of Amin-Biswas's scheme and also preserves user anonymity property.
35838765#ABSTRACT#METHODS#On the basis of well-described stress protocols,, we developed the Digital Stress Test (DST) and evaluated its feasibility and stress induction potential in a large web-based study. A total of 284 participants completed either the DST (n=103; 52/103,, 50.5% women; mean age 31.34,, SD 9.48 years) or an adapted control version (n=181; 96/181,, 53% women; mean age 31.51,, SD 11.18 years) with their smartphones via a web application. We compared their affective responses using the international Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form before and after stress induction. In addition,, we assessed the participants' stress-related feelings indicated in visual analogue scales before,, during,, and after the procedure,, and further analyzed the implemented stress-inducing elements. Finally,, we compared the DST participants' stress reactivity with the results obtained in a classic stress test paradigm using data previously collected in 4 independent Trier Social Stress Test studies including 122 participants overall.
35838765#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Participants in the DST manifested significantly higher perceived stress indexes than the Control-DST participants at all measurements after the baseline (P<.001). Furthermore,, the effect size of the increase in DST participants' negative affect (d=0.427) lay within the range of effect sizes for the increase in negative affect in the previously conducted Trier Social Stress Test experiments (0.281-1.015).
35838765#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We present evidence that a digital stress paradigm administered by smartphone can be used for standardized stress induction and multimodal data collection on a large scale. Further development of the DST prototype and a subsequent validation study including physiological markers are outlined.

32415876#ABSTRACT##Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has the largest drug pipeline among neuromuscular diseases,, with over 160 companies actively involved in ALS research. There is a growing need to recruit trial participants,, but ALS patients often have limited mobility and most ALS trials are conducted in a small number of major centers. These factors effectively limit patient participation,, particularly for those in rural areas. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the more widespread use of telemedicine technology for clinical care,, and has prompted consideration of its increased use for clinical trials. In this opinion piece,, we describe the current state of telemedicine for recruitment,, consenting,, and screening of participants for clinical trials. We also summarize the available data on remote administration of outcome measures. Current challenges include validation of outcome measures for remote assessment,, as well as technological,, regulatory,, and licensure barriers.

22498580#ABSTRACT##Digital pathology systems offer pathologists an alternate,, emerging mechanism to manage and interpret information. They offer increasingly fast and scalable hardware platforms for slide scanning and software that facilitates remote viewing,, slide conferencing,, archiving,, and image analysis. Deployed initially and validated largely within the research and biopharmaceutical industries,, WSI is increasingly being implemented for direct patient care. Improvements in image quality,, scan times,, and imageviewing browsers will hopefully allow pathologists to more seamlessly convert to digital pathology,, much like our radiology colleagues have done before us. However,, WSI creates both opportunities and challenges. Although niche applications of WSI technology for clinical,, educational,, and research purposes are clearly successful,, it is evident that several areas still require attention and careful consideration before more widespread clinical adoption of WSI takes place. These include regulatory issues,, development of standards of practice and validation guidelines,, workflow modifications,, as well as defining situations where WSI technology will really improve practice in a cost-effective way. Current progress on these and other issues,, along with improving technology,, will no doubt pave the way for increased adoption over the next decade,, allowing the pathology community as a whole to harness the true potential of WSI for patient care. The digital decade will likely redefine how pathology is practiced and the role of the pathologist.

36995747#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Preventive care helps patients identify and address medical issues early when they are easy to treat. The internet offers vast information about preventive measures,, but the sheer volume of data can be overwhelming for individuals to process. To help individuals navigate this information,, recommender systems filter and recommend relevant information to specific users. Despite their popularity in other fields,, such as e-commerce,, recommender systems have yet to be extensively studied as tools to support the implementation of prevention strategies in health care. This underexplored area presents an opportunity for recommender systems to serve as a complementary tool for medical professionals to enhance patient-centered decision-making and for patients to access health information. Thus,, these systems can potentially improve the delivery of preventive care.
36995747#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study proposes practical,, evidence-based propositions. It aims to identify the key factors influencing patients' use of recommender systems and outlines a study design,, methods for creating a survey,, and techniques for conducting an analysis.
36995747#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study proposes a 6-stage approach to examine user perceptions of the factors that may influence the use of recommender systems for preventive care. First,, we formulate 6 research propositions that can be developed later into hypotheses for empirical testing. Second,, we will create a survey instrument by collecting items from extant literature and then verify their relevance using expert analysis. This stage will continue with content and face validity testing to ensure the robustness of the selected items. Using Qualtrics (Qualtrics),, the survey can be customized and prepared for deployment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Third,, we will obtain institutional review board approval because this is a human subject study. In the fourth stage,, we propose using the survey to collect data from approximately 600 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk and then using R to analyze the research model. This platform will serve as a recruitment tool and the method of obtaining informed consent. In our fifth stage,, we will perform principal component analysis,, Harman Single Factor test,, exploratory factor analysis,, and correlational analysis; examine the reliability and convergent validity of individual items; test if multicollinearity exists; and complete a confirmatory factor analysis.
36995747#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Data collection and analysis will begin after institutional review board approval is obtained.
36995747#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In pursuit of better health outcomes,, low costs,, and improved patient and provider experiences,, the integration of recommender systems with health care services can extend the reach and scale of preventive care. Examining recommender systems for preventive care can be vital in achieving the quadruple aims by advancing the steps toward precision medicine and applying best practices.

30481180#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The standard approaches to diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluate between 20 and 100 behaviors and take several hours to complete. This has in part contributed to long wait times for a diagnosis and subsequent delays in access to therapy. We hypothesize that the use of machine learning analysis on home video can speed the diagnosis without compromising accuracy. We have analyzed item-level records from 2 standard diagnostic instruments to construct machine learning classifiers optimized for sparsity,, interpretability,, and accuracy. In the present study,, we prospectively test whether the features from these optimized models can be extracted by blinded nonexpert raters from 3-minute home videos of children with and without ASD to arrive at a rapid and accurate machine learning autism classification.
30481180#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND FINDINGS#We created a mobile web portal for video raters to assess 30 behavioral features (e.g.,, eye contact,, social smile) that are used by 8 independent machine learning models for identifying ASD,, each with >94% accuracy in cross-validation testing and subsequent independent validation from previous work. We then collected 116 short home videos of children with autism (mean age = 4 years 10 months,, SD = 2 years 3 months) and 46 videos of typically developing children (mean age = 2 years 11 months,, SD = 1 year 2 months). Three raters blind to the diagnosis independently measured each of the 30 features from the 8 models,, with a median time to completion of 4 minutes. Although several models (consisting of alternating decision trees,, support vector machine [SVM],, logistic regression (LR),, radial kernel,, and linear SVM) performed well,, a sparse 5-feature LR classifier (LR5) yielded the highest accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 92% [95% CI 88%-97%]) across all ages tested. We used a prospectively collected independent validation set of 66 videos (33 ASD and 33 non-ASD) and 3 independent rater measurements to validate the outcome,, achieving lower but comparable accuracy (AUC: 89% [95% CI 81%-95%]). Finally,, we applied LR to the 162-video-feature matrix to construct an 8-feature model,, which achieved 0.93 AUC (95% CI 0.90-0.97) on the held-out test set and 0.86 on the validation set of 66 videos. Validation on children with an existing diagnosis limited the ability to generalize the performance to undiagnosed populations.
30481180#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These results support the hypothesis that feature tagging of home videos for machine learning classification of autism can yield accurate outcomes in short time frames,, using mobile devices. Further work will be needed to confirm that this approach can accelerate autism diagnosis at scale.

33465108#ABSTRACT##The coronavirus disease pandemic has brought a new urgency for the development and deployment of web-based applications which complement,, and offer alternatives to,, traditional one-on-one consultations and pencil-and-paper (PaP) based assessments that currently dominate clinical research. We have recently developed a web-based application that can be used for the self-administered collection of patient demographics,, self-rated health,, depression and anxiety,, and cognition as part of a single platform. In this study we report the findings from a study with 155 cognitively healthy older adults who received established PaP versions,, as well as our novel computerized measures of self-rated health,, depression and anxiety,, and cognition. Moderate to high correlations were observed between PaP and web- based measures of self-rated health (r = 0.77),, depression and anxiety (r = 0.72),, and preclinical Alzheimer's disease cognitive composite (PACC) (r = .61). Test-retest correlations were variable with high correlations for a measure of processing speed and a measure of delayed episodic memory. Taken together,, these data support the feasibility and validity of utilization of this novel web-based platform as a new alternative for collecting patient demographics and the assessment of self-rated health,, depression and anxiety,, and cognition in the elderly.

29444787#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS#This is a single-centre pragmatic randomised and controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a discharge follow-up phone call to reduce 30-day inpatient readmissions. Our primary endpoint is inpatient readmission within 30?days of hospital discharge censored for death analysed with an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary endpoints included observation status readmission within 30?days,, time to readmission,, all-cause emergency department revisits within 30?days,, patient satisfaction (measured as mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores) and 30-day mortality. Exploratory endpoints include the need for assistance with discharge plan implementation among those randomised to the intervention arm and reached by the study nurse,, and the number of call attempts to achieve successful intervention delivery. Consistent with the Learning Healthcare System model for clinical research,, timeliness is a critical quality for studies to most effectively inform hospital clinical practice. We are challenged to apply pragmatic design elements in order to maintain a high-quality practicable study providing timely results. This type of prospective pragmatic trial empowers the advancement of hospital-wide evidence-based practice directly affecting patients.
29444787#ABSTRACT#ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION#Study results will inform the structure,, objective and function of future iterations of the hospital's discharge follow-up phone call programme and be submitted for publication in the literature.

27566472#ABSTRACT##Many mobile phone or tablet applications have been designed to control cardiovascular risk factors (obesity,, smoking,, sedentary lifestyle,, diabetes and hypertension) or to optimize treatment adherence. Some have been shown to be useful but the long-term benefits remain to be demonstrated. Digital stethoscopes make easier the interpretation of abnormal heart sounds,, and the development of pocket-sized echo machines may quickly and significantly expand the use of ultrasounds. Daily home monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures with wireless implantable sensors has been shown to be associated with a significant decrease in hospital readmissions for heart failure. There are more and more non-invasive,, wireless,, and wearable sensors designed to monitor heart rate,, heart rate variability,, respiratory rate,, arterial oxygen saturation,, and thoracic fluid content. They have the potential to change the way we monitor and treat patients with cardiovascular diseases in the hospital and beyond. Some may have the ability to improve quality of care,, decrease the number of medical visits and hospitalization,, and ultimately health care costs. Validation and outcome studies are needed to clarify,, among the growing number of digital innovations and wearable sensors,, which tools have real clinical value.

35679780#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Video-oculography (VOG) could be useful for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and multiple sclerosis (MS),, as a high prevalence of subclinical eye movements abnormalities (EMA) has been previously reported,, with a potential prognostic value regarding disease evolution. However,, access to VOG is limited in clinical practice.
35679780#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To evaluate the reliability of VOG recordings performed using eVOG,, a mobile application developed on an iPad.
35679780#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Patients with MS or related disease without clinically detectable EMA were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during which two VOG exams (classical VOG and eVOG) were performed on the same day. We examined reflex saccades,, antisaccades,, smooth pursuit and fixation. The total number of deficits,, saccadic latencies and velocities,, qualitative smooth pursuit were compared.
35679780#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#30 patients were included. The mean number of EMA per patient on classical VOG was 4.1 and 2.3 on eVOG. We found a statistical association between the number of EMA for each exam (r = 0.66,, p < 0.0001). Saccades latencies (r = 0.57,, p < 0.0001) and velocities (r = 0.45,, p < 0.0001) were also well correlated. Assessing eVOG accuracy,, we found a sensitivity ranging from 44% to 100% and a specificity ranging from 71% to 88.9% depending on the considered abnormality.

29334277#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study assessed the validity of DPOAE screening conducted by village health workers (VHWs) in a rural community. Real-time click evoked tele-auditory brainstem response (tele-ABR) was used as the gold standard to establish validity.
29334277#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#A cross-sectional design was utilised to compare the results of screening by VHWs to those obtained via tele-ABR. Study samples: One hundred and nineteen subjects (0 to 5?years) were selected randomly from a sample of 2880 infants and young children who received DPOAE screening by VHWs.
29334277#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Real time tele-ABR was conducted by using satellite or broadband internet connectivity at the village. An audiologist located at the tertiary care hospital conducted tele-ABR testing through a remote computing paradigm. Tele-ABR was recorded using standard recording parameters recommended for infants and young children. Wave morphology,, repeatability and peak latency data were used for ABR analysis.
29334277#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Tele-ABR and DPOAE findings were compared for 197 ears. The sensitivity of DPOAE screening conducted by the VHW was 75%,, and specificity was 91%. The negative and positive predictive values were 98.8% and 27.2%,, respectively.
29334277#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The validity of DPOAE screening conducted by trained VHW was acceptable. This study supports the engagement of grass-root workers in community-based hearing health care provision.

27896433#ABSTRACT##Disability measures in multiple sclerosis (MS) rely heavily on ambulatory function,, and current metrics fail to capture potentially important variability in walking behavior. We sought to determine whether remote step count monitoring using a consumer-friendly accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) can enhance MS disability assessment. 99 adults with relapsing or progressive MS able to walk =2-min were prospectively recruited. At 4 weeks,, study retention was 97% and median Fitbit use was 97% of days. Substudy validation resulted in high interclass correlations between Fitbit,, ActiGraph and manual step count tally during a 2-minute walk test,, and between Fitbit and ActiGraph (ICC = 0.76) during 7-day home monitoring. Over 4 weeks of continuous monitoring,, daily steps were lower in progressive versus relapsing MS (mean difference 2546 steps,, p < 0.01). Lower average daily step count was associated with greater disability on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (p < 0.001). Within each EDSS category,, substantial variability in step count was apparent (i.e.,, EDSS = 6.0 range 1097-7152). Step count demonstrated moderate-strong correlations with other walking measures. Lower average daily step count is associated with greater MS disability and captures important variability in real-world walking activity otherwise masked by standard disability scales,, including the EDSS. These results support remote step count monitoring as an exploratory outcome in MS trials.

31579026#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Wrist-worn activity trackers are popular,, and an increasing number of these devices are equipped with heart rate (HR) measurement capabilities. However,, the validity of HR data obtained from such trackers has not been thoroughly assessed outside the laboratory setting.
31579026#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to investigate the validity of HR measures of a high-cost consumer-based tracker (Polar A370) and a low-cost tracker (Tempo HR) in the laboratory and free-living settings.
33118944#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The development and use of mobile health (mHealth) apps for asthma management have risen dramatically over the past two decades. Asthma apps vary widely in their content and features; however,, prior research has rarely examined preferences of users of publicly available apps.
33118944#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goals of this study were to provide a descriptive overview of asthma mobile apps that are publicly available and to assess the usability of asthma apps currently available on the market to identify content and features of apps associated with positive and negative user ratings.
33118944#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Reviews were collected on June 23,, 2020,, and included publicly posted reviews until June 21,, 2020. To characterize features associated with high or low app ratings,, we first dichotomized the average user rating of the asthma app into 2 categories: a high average rating and a low average rating. Asthma apps with average ratings of 4 and above were categorized as having a high average rating. Asthma apps with average ratings of less than 4 were categorized as having a low average rating. For the sentiment analysis,, we modeled both 2-word (bi-gram) and 3-word (tri-gram) phrases which commonly appeared across highly rated and lowly rated apps.

31579026#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants underwent a laboratory-based cycling protocol while wearing the two trackers and the chest-strapped Polar H10,, which acted as criterion. Participants also wore the devices throughout the waking hours of the following day during which they were required to conduct at least one 10-min bout of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to ensure variability in the HR signal. We extracted 10-second values from all devices and time-matched HR data from the trackers with those from the Polar H10. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs),, mean absolute errors,, and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) between the criterion and the trackers. We constructed decile plots that compared HR data from Tempo HR and Polar A370 with criterion measures across intensity deciles. We investigated how many HR data points within the MVPA zone (=64% of maximum HR) were detected by the trackers.
31579026#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 57 people screened,, 55 joined the study (mean age 30.5 [SD 9.8] years). Tempo HR showed moderate agreement and large errors (laboratory: ICC 0.51 and MAPE 13.00%; free-living: ICC 0.71 and MAPE 10.20%). Polar A370 showed moderate-to-strong agreement and small errors (laboratory: ICC 0.73 and MAPE 6.40%; free-living: ICC 0.83 and MAPE 7.10%). Decile plots indicated increasing differences between Tempo HR and the criterion as HRs increased. Such trend was less pronounced when considering the Polar A370 HR data. Tempo HR identified 62.13% (1872/3013) and 54.27% (5717/10,,535) of all MVPA time points in the laboratory phase and free-living phase,, respectively. Polar A370 detected 81.09% (2273/2803) and 83.55% (9323/11,,158) of all MVPA time points in the laboratory phase and free-living phase,, respectively.
31579026#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#HR data from the examined wrist-worn trackers were reasonably accurate in both the settings,, with the Polar A370 showing stronger agreement with the Polar H10 and smaller errors. Inaccuracies increased with increasing HRs; this was pronounced for Tempo HR.

33118944#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 10 apps that met the inclusion criteria,, a total of 373 reviews were examined across all apps. Among apps reviewed,, 53.4% (199/373) received high ratings (average ratings of 4 or 5) and 47.2% (176/373) received low ratings (average ratings of 3 or less). The number of ratings across all apps ranged from 188 (AsthmaMD) to 10 (My Asthma App); 30% (3/10) of apps were available on both Android and iOS. From the sentiment analysis,, key features of asthma management that were common among highly rated apps included the tracking of peak flow readings (n=48),, asthma symptom monitoring (n=11),, and action plans (n=10). Key features related to functionality that were common among highly rated apps included ease of use (n=5). Users most commonly reported loss of data (n=14) and crashing of app (n=12) as functionality issues among poorly rated asthma apps.
33118944#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our study results demonstrate that asthma app quality,, maintenance,, and updates vary widely across apps and platforms. These findings may call into question the long-term engagement with asthma apps,, a crucial factor for determining their potential to improve asthma self-management and asthma clinical outcomes.

36263539#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 376 patients completed the survey and were included in the study: 293 (77.9%) considered TM valuable for managing their disease,, and 307 (85%) wanted to have TM service at their center. However,, only 99 patients (26.3%) believed that TM guarantees the same level of care as the in-person visit. Among the socio-demographic variables,, those independently associated with trust in TM were the higher education qualification (p=0.02) and the level of competence in information and communication technologies (ICT) (p=0.03).
36263539#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our findings highlighted the importance of equipping IBD patients with basic ICT skills to utilize TM services and increase their confidence in ICT with the help of caregivers. Additionally,, to improve the perceived value of TM,, it will be helpful to use additional tools such as telemonitoring of disease activity using patients' reported outcomes or remote measurement of fecal calprotectin.

34299777#ABSTRACT##About 40% of the adult population is affected by snoring,, which is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and can be associated with serious health implications. Commercial smartphone applications (apps) offer the possibility of monitoring snoring at home. However,, the number of validation studies addressing snoring apps is limited. The purpose of the present study was to assess the accuracy of recorded snoring using the free version of the app SnoreLab (Reviva Softworks Ltd.,, London,, UK) in comparison to a full-night polygraphic measurement (Miniscreen plus,, Löwenstein Medical GmbH & Co.,, KG,, Bad Ems,, Germany). Nineteen healthy adult volunteers (4 female,, 15 male,, mean age: 38.9 ± 19.4 years) underwent simultaneous polygraphic and SnoreLab app measurement for one night at home. Parameters obtained by the SnoreLab app were: starting/ending time of monitoring,, time in bed,, duration and percent of quiet sleep,, light,, loud and epic snoring,, total snoring time and Snore Score,, a specific score obtained by the SnoreLab app. Data obtained from polygraphy were: starting/ending time of monitoring,, time in bed,, total snoring time,, snore index (SI),, snore index obstructive (SI obstructive) and apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI). For different thresholds of percentage snoring per night,, accuracy,, sensitivity,, specificity,, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Comparison of methods was undertaken by Spearman-Rho correlations and Bland-Altman plots. The SnoreLab app provides acceptable accuracy values measuring snoring >50% per night: 94.7% accuracy,, 100% sensitivity,, 94.1% specificity,, 66.6% positive prediction value and 100% negative prediction value. Best agreement between both methods was achieved in comparing the sum of loud and epic snoring ratios obtained by the SnoreLab app with the total snoring ratio measured by polygraphy. Obstructive events could not be detected by the SnoreLab app. Compared to polygraphy,, the SnoreLab app provides acceptable accuracy values regarding the measurement of especially heavy snoring.

11151608#ABSTRACT##Sleep disorders have a high prevalence in the general population: insomnia (10-20% of adults),, sleep apnoea syndromes (4-6%). They are responsible for high costs of investigations and treatment modalities. The investigations are usually done in sleep laboratories at the expense of cost in personnel and long waiting lists. Remote monitoring could be an alternative to sleep laboratory studies. The first aim was to determine the need for sleep remote recording in sleep medicine in Europe,, to improve health delivery and to reduce investigation costs. An enquiry was sent to 500 sleep medicine providers in Europe. Response rate was 11%. Analysis showed that the main diagnosis is obstructive sleep apnoea in adults. Currently 2/3 of sleep studies are performed in laboratory: In-lab studies: Average cost for the health care is 390 EURO/study. The range is from 700 in Finland and Germany and 180 in Greece,, Belgium and Sweden are around the mean. Ambulatory studies with EEG: Average cost is around 120 EURO/study i.e. 30% of in-lab cost. The range is from 180 EURO in Portugal to 70 EURO in Germany. 50% of users are not satisfied with their current practice of ambulatory monitoring although they have a clear need for this technique to increase monitoring capacity (88%),, reduce cost of investigation (85%),, improve sleep quality (60%),, and obtain better acceptance from the patient (76%). The expectations from ambulatory monitoring are: high diagnostic sensitivity (86%) high reliability of equipment (92%) low interference with patient's habits (94%) It is worth noting that 74% of users do not expect a fully automated interpretation of data. The indications cited are screening and follow-up of SAS,, epilepsy,, Periodic Leg Movements and also insomnia and narcolepsy. As a second aim,, a validation study has been set-up for an ambulatory recorder. The reproducibility of the system has been evaluated in 14 patients by 2 consecutive home recordings and was satisfactory in terms of total sleep time and apnoea-hypopnea index. Nevertheless a failure rate of 7% was observed which should be improved by a better ergonomy of the system. The third aim was a socio-economical analysis in Paris,, in order to define the actual standard mean cost of a polysomnography in the lab (500 EURO) and in ambulatory (238 EURO) i.e. less than one half of the laboratory cost. The monography of the health care process for sleep medicine in Paris showed a delay of more than 10 years for diagnosis of SAS in 25% of the patients and up to 5 physicians visited before referral to the sleep lab. In 48% of the cases the primary physician visited is a GP. In conclusion,, there is a clear need for ambulatory monitoring of sleep disorders to decrease the burden of cost and long waiting lists which is not well satisfied with the current health care system and commercially available equipment.

36273716#ABSTRACT#TARGET POPULATION#Women over 18 years with urinary incontinence.
36273716#ABSTRACT#INTENDED AUDIENCE#Relevant primary care providers and medical specialists,, including physicians,, nurses,, midwives,, and pelvic health physiotherapists.
36273716#ABSTRACT#OPTIONS#Websites and mobile health applications are useful in the conservative care of urinary incontinence. Relevant care providers should be familiar with such tools,, particularly those that use motivational principles for behaviour change,, which can be used as adjunct tools for urinary incontinence care. Telemedicine is an effect mode to provide services for the conservative care of urinary incontinence.
36273716#ABSTRACT#OUTCOMES#Use of eHealth and mHealth solutions has potentially significant health outcomes for patients,, providers,, and global health systems. Broader use of telemedicine,, in and of itself,, could improve care access and reduce costs incurred by patients and the health care system.
36273716#ABSTRACT#BENEFITS,, HARMS,, AND COSTS#Evidence for the efficacy of eHealth and mHealth technologies and applications for urinary incontinence ranges from weak to strong.

36894892#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Frailty is a complex age-related clinical condition that increases vulnerability to stressors. Early recognition of frailty is challenging. While primary care providers (PCPs) serve as the first point of contact for most older adults,, convenient tools for identifying frailty in primary care are lacking. Electronic consultation (eConsult),, a platform connecting PCPs to specialists,, is a rich source of provider-to-provider communication data. Text-based patient descriptions on eConsult may provide opportunities for earlier identification of frailty. We sought to explore the feasibility and validity of identifying frailty status using eConsult data.
36894892#ABSTRACT#METHODS#eConsult cases closed in 2019 and submitted on behalf of long-term care (LTC) residents or community-dwelling older adults were sampled. A list of frailty-related terms was compiled through a review of the literature and consultation with experts. To identify frailty,, eConsult text was parsed to measure the frequency of frailty-related terms. Feasibility of this approach was assessed by examining the availability of frailty-related terms in eConsult communication logs,, and by asking clinicians to indicate whether they can assess likelihood of frailty by reviewing the cases. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the number of frailty-related terms in cases about LTC residents with those about community-dwelling older adults. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing clinicians' ratings of frailty to the frequency of frailty-related terms.
36894892#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#One hundred thirteen LTC and 112 community cases were included. Frailty-related terms identified per case averaged 4.55?±?3.95 in LTC and 1.96?±?2.68 in the community (p?<?.001). Clinicians consistently rated cases with?=?5 frailty-related terms as highly likely of living with frailty.
36894892#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The availability of frailty-related terms establishes the feasibility of using provider-to-provider communication on eConsult to identify patients with high likelihood of living with this condition. The higher average of frailty-related terms in LTC (versus community) cases,, and agreement between clinician-provided frailty ratings and the frequency of frailty-related terms,, support the validity of an eConsult-based approach to identifying frailty. There is potential for eConsult to be used as a case-finding tool in primary care for early recognition and proactive initiation of care processes for older patients living with frailty.

24888983#ABSTRACT##Recently,, Awasthi and Srivastava proposed a novel biometric remote user authentication scheme for the telecare medicine information system (TMIS) with nonce. Their scheme is very efficient as it is based on efficient chaotic one-way hash function and bitwise XOR operations. In this paper,, we first analyze Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme and then show that their scheme has several drawbacks: (1) incorrect password change phase,, (2) fails to preserve user anonymity property,, (3) fails to establish a secret session key beween a legal user and the server,, (4) fails to protect strong replay attack,, and (5) lacks rigorous formal security analysis. We then a propose a novel and secure biometric-based remote user authentication scheme in order to withstand the security flaw found in Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme and enhance the features required for an idle user authentication scheme. Through the rigorous informal and formal security analysis,, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition,, we simulate our scheme for the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks,, including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Our scheme is also efficient as compared to Awasthi-Srivastava's scheme.

35547229#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Digital diagnostic decision support tools promise to accelerate diagnosis and increase health care efficiency in rheumatology. Rheumatic? is an online tool developed by specialists in rheumatology and general medicine together with patients and patient organizations. It calculates a risk score for several rheumatic diseases. We ran a pilot study retrospectively testing Rheumatic? for its ability to differentiate symptoms from existing or emerging immune-mediated rheumatic diseases from other rheumatic and musculoskeletal complaints and disorders in patients visiting rheumatology clinics.
21366463#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 606 diagnoses were evaluated in pairs (202 per pathologist). Seven cases did not transfer to the database and were eliminated from further study. We report no discrepancies between media in 75%,, 87%,, and 83% of the cases diagnosed by the 3 pathologists,, respectively; significant discrepancies were identified in 3%,, 3%,, and 7% of cases by each pathologist. In total,, we identified significant clinical and therapeutic discrepancies in 13 of 296 cases (4.4%). The certainty values provided by each pathologist were similar between formats.

34847193#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine can be used to conduct ophthalmological assessment of patients,, facilitating patient access to specialist care. Since the teleophthalmology models require data collection support from other health professionals,, the purpose of our study was to assess agreement between the nursing technician and the ophthalmologist in acquisition of health parameters that can be used for remote analysis as part of a telemedicine strategy. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 patients referred to an ophthalmological telediagnosis center by primary healthcare doctors. The health parameters evaluated were visual acuity (VA),, objective ophthalmic measures acquired by autorefraction,, keratometry,, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze agreement between the nursing technician and the ophthalmologist. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias equal to zero for the VA measurements [95%-LoA: -0.25-0.25],, 0.01 [95%-LoA: -0.86-0.88] for spherical equivalent (M),, -0.08 [95%-LoA: -1.1-0.95] for keratometry (K) and -0.23 [95%-LoA: -4.4-4.00] for IOP. The measures had a high linear correlation (R [95%CI]: 0.87 [0.82-0.91]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]; 0.96 [0.95-0.97] and 0.88 [0.84-0.91] respectively). The results observed demonstrate that remote ophthalmological data collection by adequately trained health professionals is viable. This confirms the utility and safety of these solutions for scenarios in which access to ophthalmologists is limited.

35547229#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The performance of Rheumatic? was tested using in three university rheumatology centers: (A) patients at Risk for RA (Karolinska Institutet,, n = 50 individuals with musculoskeletal complaints and anti-citrullinated protein antibody positivity) (B) patients with early joint swelling [dataset B (Erlangen) n = 52]. (C) Patients with early arthritis where the clinician considered it likely to be of auto-immune origin [dataset C (Leiden) n = 73]. In dataset A we tested whether Rheumatic? could predict the development of arthritis. In dataset B and C we tested whether Rheumatic? could predict the development of an immune-mediated rheumatic diseases. We examined the discriminative power of the total score with the Wilcoxon rank test and the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Next,, we calculated the test characteristics for these patients passing the first or second expert-based Rheumatic? scoring threshold.
35547229#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The total test scores differentiated between: (A) Individuals developing arthritis or not,, median 245 vs. 163,, P < 0.0001,, AUC-ROC = 75.3; (B) patients with an immune-mediated arthritic disease or not median 191 vs. 107,, P < 0.0001,, AUC-ROC = 79.0; but less patients with an immune-mediated arthritic disease or not amongst those where the clinician already considered an immune mediated disease most likely (median 262 vs. 212,, P < 0.0001,, AUC-ROC = 53.6). Threshold-1 (advising to visit primary care doctor) was highly specific in dataset A and B (0.72,, 0.87,, and 0.23,, respectively) and sensitive (0.67,, 0.61,, and 0.67). Threshold-2 (advising to visit rheumatologic care) was very specific in all three centers but not very sensitive: specificity of 1.0,, 0.96,, and 0.91,, sensitivity 0.05,, 0.07,, 0.14 in dataset A,, B,, and C,, respectively.
35547229#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Rheumatic? is a web-based patient-centered multilingual diagnostic tool capable of differentiating immune-mediated rheumatic conditions from other musculoskeletal problems. The current scoring system needs to be further optimized.

25991131#ABSTRACT##We developed a strengthening exercise support system which can be remotely managed and clinically supervised via internet. Older adults may potentially benefit from such an exercise system however functionality of this system requires validation before commencement of field studies in older adults. The aim of this study was to introduce and assess validity of a prototype telerehabilitation system supporting computer-assisted home-based strengthening exercise. The system included a resistance chair with a set of movement and physiologic sensors. Real-time feedback on exercise performance was displayed on a touch screen dashboard. Personalized exercise parameters were managed by a rehabilitation team via a designated telerehabilitation site. Assessment of the system demonstrated sufficient validity in real-time identification of exercise performance and cardiovascular parameters. We concluded that the interactive resistance chair has a potential in promoting strengthening exercise and it is warranted for further evaluation in community dwelling older adults.

33855008#ABSTRACT##Background: The social environment,, comprised of social support,, social burden,, and quality of interactions,, influences a range of health outcomes,, including mental health. Passive audio data collection on mobile phones (e.g.,, episodic recording of the auditory environment without requiring any active input from the phone user) enables new opportunities to understand the social environment. We evaluated the use of passive audio collection on mobile phones as a window into the social environment while conducting a study of mental health among adolescent and young mothers in Nepal. Methods: We enrolled 23 adolescent and young mothers who first participated in qualitative interviews to describe their social support and identify sounds potentially associated with that support. Then,, episodic recordings were collected for 2 weeks from the mothers using an app to record 30 s of audio every 15 min from 4 A.M. to 9 P.M. Audio data were processed and classified using a pretrained model. Each classification category was accompanied by an estimated accuracy score. Manual validation of the machine-predicted speech and non-speech categories was done for accuracy. Results: In qualitative interviews,, mothers described a range of positive and negative social interactions and the sounds that accompanied these. Potential positive sounds included adult speech and laughter,, infant babbling and laughter,, and sounds from baby toys. Sounds characterizing negative stimuli included yelling,, crying,, screaming by adults and crying by infants. Sounds associated with social isolation included silence and TV or radio noises. Speech comprised 43% of all passively recorded audio clips (n = 7,,725). Manual validation showed a 23% false positive rate and 62% false-negative rate for speech,, demonstrating potential underestimation of speech exposure. Other common sounds were music and vehicular noises. Conclusions: Passively capturing audio has the potential to improve understanding of the social environment. However,, a pre-trained model had the limited accuracy for identifying speech and lacked categories allowing distinction between positive and negative social interactions. To improve the contribution of passive audio collection to understanding the social environment,, future work should improve the accuracy of audio categorization,, code for constellations of sounds,, and combine audio with other smartphone data collection such as location and activity.

37485332#ABSTRACT#SETTING#The internet is an important source of health information but is unregulated. Little research has focused on the assessment of digital information related to nutrition.
37485332#ABSTRACT#AIM#To develop and validate a novel online quality assessment tool (OQAT) for quality assessment of online nutrition information.
37485332#ABSTRACT#METHOD#The OQAT was developed and validated in six distinct stages. After reviewing the literature,, a framework and criteria were developed and formalised. Next,, the quality assessment criteria were piloted on a subset of data and criteria refined. The established criteria were then validated against a previously validated assessment tool,, and reliability was tested. Finally,, the validated OQAT was used to assess the quality of articles from a 24-h collection period,, 19 April 2021.
37485332#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#(2)?=?23.22,, p?<?0.001,, with a mean rank OQAT score of 138.2 for blogs,, 216.6 for news articles,, and 188.7 for press releases.
37485332#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This novel tool provides a reliable and objective method for assessing the quality of nutrition content online. It could potentially be used by researchers to assess the quality of online information in different settings and by organisations to inform readers of the quality of information being accessed.

34820134#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Wearable activity trackers hold potential as a research tool to increase physical activity. However,, long-term wearable adherence is low among users,, which may be due to the limited understanding of the factors related to use and relation to health behavior theory. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore the perceptions of wearables among active adult users and non-users. Findings will inform potential barriers and facilitators for the adherence and adoption of wearables through the application of the Self-Determination Theory.
34820134#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Six focus groups were conducted and equally stratified to wearable users (n?=?10) and non-users (n?=?10). Data were audio recorded,, transcribed,, and analyzed using an iterative approach creating first-level codes. This was followed by developing second-level codes that allowed for generating themes.
34820134#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#For users,, the wearables' feedback provided them with validation,, a sense of achievement,, and other-determined motivation. Users appreciated the functionality of wearables,, particularly with simpler and newer models. They also reported improvements in health behaviors. While both users and non-users had a general positive feeling towards wearables,, they held similar concerns about cost,, guilt,, dependency,, and accuracy. Non-users were unique in their concerns for materialism and functionality (i.e. ease of use and charge) associated with wearables. They also seemed to be more intrinsically motivated to be physically active by relying less on external sources of motivation as potentially provided by wearables.
34820134#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings show that while both adult users and non-users held positive perceptions of wearables and concerns for feelings of guilt and dependency,, widespread adoption and adherence may be prevented by differences in motivation for physical activity and concerns for cost,, materialism,, and functionality.

26491941#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Adequacy assessment for fine-needle aspiration procedures is a standard of care in large medical centers. Although the benefits of this approach include higher adequacy rates with fewer passes,, it costs cytopathologist time and affects other clinical responsibilities. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of mobile video streaming (FaceTime) technology with the help of smartphone adapters attached to microscopes for remote adequacy assessment of cytologic samples.
26491941#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study consisted of 2 phases: Phase 1 was a retrospective assessment of 25 samples by a primary pathologist with simultaneous streaming to a second pathologist using a smartphone (iPhone/iPad) FaceTime connection. Data on the adequacy of each sample and preliminary diagnoses were recorded. In phase 2,, live cases were assessed prospectively by an onsite primary pathologist and by a remote pathologist using an iPhone/iPad-FaceTime connection. The testing phase involved prospective assessment of additional samples with a resident or cytotechnologist as the slide driver.
26491941#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In phase 1,, retrospective evaluation of 25 samples yielded considerable agreement (22 of 25 samples; 88%) between onsite and remote adequacy assessments. Three samples (12%) yielded results that did not agree,, including 2 samples that were read as adequate in the onsite evaluation that were assessed as indeterminate using FaceTime. In phase 2 and in the testing phase,, 14 samples exhibited considerable agreement on both adequacy and preliminary diagnosis (6 samples in phase 2 and 8 samples in the testing phase) and are currently available for reporting. Problems encountered include software version standardization,, camera alignment,, and (rarely) comprehension of the audio stream.
26491941#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The current data indicate that iPhone/iPad FaceTime technology can be used to perform remote adequacy assessments of fine-needle aspirations and can help save valuable time for pathologists.

26997110#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN/SETTING#This is a single-center,, randomized crossover phone validation of ASD patients.
26997110#ABSTRACT#PATIENT SAMPLE#The study included ASD patients presenting to a tertiary spine care center.
26997110#ABSTRACT#OUTCOME MEASURES#The outcome measures were ODI and SRS-22r.
26997110#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Phone administration of the SRS-22r and ODI to ASD patients provides a convenient and reliable tool for reducing loss of follow-up data.

26997110#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND CONTEXT#The non-response rates are as high as 20% to 50% after 5 years of follow-up in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. Minimizing loss to follow-up is essential to protect the quality of data in long-term studies. Phone and internet administration of outcomes instruments has grown in popularity and has been found to not only provide a convenient way of collecting data,, but also show improved response rates.
26997110#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The study aimed to examine the reliability of the revised Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22r) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaires in ASD patients when administered by telephone.
26997110#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Forty-nine patients (mean age: 55.7 years) with ASD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either phone completion of the SRS-22r and ODI followed by in-office completion,, or to in-office completion followed by phone completion. An interval of 2 to 4 weeks was placed between administrations of each version. A paired t test was used to assess the difference between the written and phone versions,, and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to assess homogeneity. Finally,, goodness-of-fit testing was used to assess version preference.
26997110#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There was no significant difference between the phone and in-office versions of the SRS-22r (p=.174) or the ODI (p=.320). The intraclass correlation coefficients of the SRS-22r and ODI were 0.91 and 0.86,, respectively. Completion over the phone was the most popular option (57% preferred phone,, 29% preferred in-office,, and 14% had no preference).

12766912#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Based on physician's diagnosis,, 269 were diagnosed as suffering from dementia,, 128 as suffering from MCI,, and 179 were diagnosed with no cognitive impairment. The TICS-m Hebrew version's internal consistency was very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98) and showed a strong convergent validity with the MMSE (r = 0.82; p < 0.0005). The sensitivity was 100% for each of the conditions. Finally,, after controlling for age,, education and hearing impairment,, TICS-m was a strong predictor of dementia,, MCI and cognitive impairment.
12766912#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#At a cut-off of 27/50 the Hebrew version of the TICS-m is a useful screening instrument to identify subjects suffering from mild cognitive impairment,, dementia and cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia).

37405531#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are important tools to assess patient function,, pain,, disability,, and quality of life. We aim to study the efficiency and validity of digital PROMs collection using a smartphone app compared to traditional paper PROMs.
37405531#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients undergoing evaluation for full-endoscopic spine surgery were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Harborview Medical Center. Visual analogue scale (VAS),, Oswestry disability index (ODI),, and EQ5-5D PROMs were administered on paper and through a smartphone app called SpineHealthie. Compliance rates were collected,, and PROM results were assessed for correlation between paper and digital methods.
37405531#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#123 patients were enrolled. 57.7% of patients completed paper PROMs,, 82.9% completed digital PROMs,, and 48.8% completed both. Of the patients that completed both,, Spearman's correlation was greatest for VAS leg,, ODI,, and EQ5 index scores. Correlation was weaker for VAS back pain,, neck pain,, and upper extremity pain. Patients tended to report lower disability and higher quality of life on the digital PROM compared to the paper PROM.
37405531#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The SpineHealthie app effectively and accurately collects PROMs digitally,, showing strong concordance with traditional paper PROMs. We conclude that digital PROMs constitute a promising strategy for monitoring patients after spine surgery over time.

35138257#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder that requires long-term pharmacotherapy and patient empowerment to manage the condition and recognize and respond to asthma exacerbations. Mobile health (mHealth) apps represent a potential medium through which patients can improve their ability to self-manage their asthma. Few studies have conducted a systematic evaluation of asthma mobile apps for quality and functionality using a validated tool. None of these reviews have systematically assessed these apps for their content and evaluated them against the available international best practice guidelines.
35138257#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic search and evaluation of adult-targeted asthma mHealth apps. As part of this review,, the potential of an mHealth app to improve asthma self-management and the overall quality of the app will be evaluated using the Mobile App Rating Scale framework,, and the quality of the information within an app will be evaluated using the current Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines as a reference.
35138257#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A stepwise methodological approach was taken in creating this review. First,, the most recent Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines were independently reviewed by 2 authors to identify key recommendations that could be feasibly incorporated into an mHealth app. A previously developed asthma assessment framework was identified and was modified to suit our research and ensure that all of these identified recommendations were included. In total,, 2 popular app stores were reviewed to identify potential mHealth apps. These apps were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Suitable apps were then evaluated. Technical information was obtained from publicly available information. The next step was to perform an app quality assessment using the validated Mobile App Rating Scale framework to objectively determine the quality of an app. App functionality was assessed using the Intercontinental Medical Statistics Institute for Health Informatics Functionality Scoring System. Finally,, the mHealth apps were assessed using our developed checklist.
35138257#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Funding has been received for the project from the Respiratory Department at Northern Health,, Victoria. Three reviewers have been recruited to systematically evaluate the apps. The results of this study are expected in 2022.
35138257#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#To our knowledge,, this review represents the first study to examine all mHealth apps available in Australia that are targeted to adults with asthma for their functionality,, quality,, and consistency with international best practice guidelines. Although this review will only be conducted on mHealth apps available in Australia,, many apps are available worldwide; thus,, this study should be largely generalizable to other English-speaking regions and users. The results of this review will help to fill gaps in the literature and assist clinicians in providing evidence-based advice to patients wishing to use mHealth apps as part of their asthma self-management.

32706716#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Caregivers play a pivotal role in maintaining an economically viable health care system,, yet they are characterized by low levels of psychological well-being and consistently report unmet needs for psychological support. Mobile app-based (mobile health [mHealth]) interventions present a novel approach to both reducing stress and improving well-being.
32706716#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app-based psychological intervention for people providing care to family or friends with a physical or mental disability.
32706716#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In a randomized,, single-blind,, controlled trial,, 183 caregivers recruited through the web were randomly allocated to either an intervention (n=73) or active control (n=110) condition. The intervention app contained treatment modules combining daily self-monitoring with third-wave (mindfulness-based) cognitive-behavioral therapies,, whereas the active control app contained only self-monitoring features. Both programs were completed over a 5-week period. It was hypothesized that intervention app exposure would be associated with decreases in depression,, anxiety,, and stress,, and increases in well-being,, self-esteem,, optimism,, primary and secondary control,, and social support. Outcomes were assessed at baseline,, postintervention,, and 3-4 months postintervention. App quality was also assessed.
32706716#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 25% (18/73) of the intervention participants were lost to follow-up at 3 months,, and 30.9% (34/110) of the participants from the wait-list control group dropped out before the postintervention survey. The intervention group experienced reductions in stress (b=-2.07; P=.04) and depressive symptoms (b=-1.36; P=.05) from baseline to postintervention. These changes were further enhanced from postintervention to follow-up,, with the intervention group continuing to report lower levels of depression (b=-1.82; P=.03) and higher levels of emotional well-being (b=6.13; P<.001),, optimism (b=0.78; P=.007),, self-esteem (b=-0.84; P=.005),, support from family (b=2.15; P=.001),, support from significant others (b=2.66; P<.001),, and subjective well-being (b=4.82; P<.001). On average,, participants completed 2.5 (SD 1.05) out of 5 treatment modules. The overall quality of the app was also rated highly,, with a mean score of 3.94 out of a maximum score of 5 (SD 0.58).
32706716#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study demonstrates that mHealth psychological interventions are an effective treatment option for caregivers experiencing high levels of stress. Recommendations for improving mHealth interventions for caregivers include offering flexibility and customization in the treatment design.

22267307#ABSTRACT##We compared the diagnostic accuracy of 3-lead tele-ECGs to both 12-lead tele-ECGs and a conventional 12-lead ECG device (the gold standard). The subjects were older people (n = 107) with a mean age of 66 years. The overall agreement between two cardiologists on interpreting the 3-lead tele-ECG recordings was 97% (kappa = 0.96,, P < 0.001) and it was 91% for the 12-lead tele-ECGs (kappa = 0.90,, P < 0.001). We also found excellent agreement on the interpretation of the 3-lead tele-ECGs compared to the gold standard: 98% (kappa = 0.96,, P < 0.001) and for the 12-lead tele-ECG compared to the gold standard: 98% (kappa = 0.96,, P < 0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that the apparent differences between the techniques were not clinically relevant. The use of a 3-lead tele-ECG device may be useful for reducing the delay in treating specific heart disease conditions,, e.g. in older people affected by chronic heart disease who need frequent ECG monitoring.

We aimed to validate the ability of the smartphone app EncephalApp,, a streamlined version of Stroop App,, to detect CHE. We evaluated face validity,, test-retest reliability,, and external validity.
24846278#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients with cirrhosis (n = 167; 38% with overt HE [OHE]; mean age,, 55 years; mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score,, 12) and controls (n = 114) were each given a paper and pencil cognitive battery (standard) along with EncephalApp. EncephalApp has Off and On states; results measured were OffTime,, OnTime,, OffTime+OnTime,, and number of runs required to complete 5 off and on runs. Thirty-six patients with cirrhosis underwent driving simulation tests,, and EncephalApp results were correlated with results. Test-retest reliability was analyzed in a subgroup of patients. The test was performed before and after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement,, and before and after correction for hyponatremia,, to determine external validity.
24846278#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#All patients with cirrhosis performed worse on paper and pencil and EncephalApp tests than controls. Patients with cirrhosis and OHE performed worse than those without OHE. Age-dependent EncephalApp cutoffs (younger or older than 45 years) were set. An OffTime+OnTime value of >190 seconds identified all patients with CHE with an area under the receiver operator characteristic value of 0.91; the area under the receiver operator characteristic value was 0.88 for diagnosis of CHE in those without OHE. EncephalApp times correlated with crashes and illegal turns in driving simulation tests. Test-retest reliability was high (intraclass coefficient,, 0.83) among 30 patients retested 1-3 months apart. OffTime+OnTime increased significantly (206 vs 255 seconds,, P = .007) among 10 patients retested 33 ± 7 days after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. OffTime+OnTime decreased significantly (242 vs 225 seconds,, P = .03) in 7 patients tested before and after correction for hyponatremia (126 ± 3 to 132 ± 4 meq/L,, P = .01) 10 ± 5 days apart.
24846278#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A smartphone app called EncephalApp has good face validity,, test-retest reliability,, and external validity for the diagnosis of CHE.

34492039#ABSTRACT##Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are the most prevalent pathogens among the group of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The Kato-Katz technique is the diagnosis method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) although it often presents a decreased sensitivity in low transmission settings and it is labour intensive. Visual reading of Kato-Katz preparations requires the samples to be analyzed in a short period of time since its preparation. Digitizing the samples could provide a solution which allows to store the samples in a digital database and perform remote analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on digitized samples can support diagnosis by performing an objective and automatic quantification of disease infection. In this work,, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for microscopy image digitization and automatic analysis of digitized images of STH. Our solution includes (a) a digitization system based on a mobile app that digitizes microscope samples using a 3D printed microscope adapter,, (b) a telemedicine platform for remote analysis and labelling,, and (c) novel deep learning algorithms for automatic assessment and quantification of parasitological infections by STH. The deep learning algorithm has been trained and tested on 51 slides of stool samples containing 949 Trichuris spp. eggs from 6 different subjects. The algorithm evaluation was performed using a cross-validation strategy,, obtaining a mean precision of 98.44% and a mean recall of 80.94%. The results also proved the potential of generalization capability of the method at identifying different types of helminth eggs. Additionally,, the AI-assisted quantification of STH based on digitized samples has been compared to the one performed using conventional microscopy,, showing a good agreement between measurements. In conclusion,, this work has presented a comprehensive pipeline using smartphone-assisted microscopy. It is integrated with a telemedicine platform for automatic image analysis and quantification of STH infection using AI models.
20690401#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Quality of life (QoL) and functional status are important aspects of health especially for older people. Efficient and valid ways of measuring older people's health is of great importance.
20690401#ABSTRACT#AIM#This project aims to establish the reliability of use of (1) a quality of life measure,, the WHOQOL-BREF,, and (2) a functional measure,, the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale (NEADL),, for use over the telephone.
20690401#ABSTRACT#METHODS#With ethical approval,, patients over age 75 years (65 years if Maori) have been enrolled in the BRIGHT trial; a randomised controlled trial testing a practice-based screening initiative to prevent disability. Participants with possible disability,, defined as being unable to get in and out of the car or take hot drinks from one room to another,, completed a telephone interview including the two measures. Seventy participants repeated the two measures during a face-to-face interview within three months.
20690401#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both WHOQOL-BREF and NEADL scores for the two forms of administration produced high Pearson correlation coefficients. There was good agreement for the WHOQOL-BREF as shown by th Bland-Altman graphs; however there was a tendency of a greater negative difference the greater the average score became (higher level of function) for the NEADL.

9621736#ABSTRACT##This paper addresses the control of understanding in a task involving medical assistance given by phone. This situation was described and analyzed in two previous papers with different goals. Here we focus on activity carried out by the operator in charge of emergency calls (injuries,, suicides,, medical problems,,...) in which the operator must control data given by the caller. We assume that the quality of data in the very first message (by the caller) influences the nature of control (by the operator). Methodology for assessing quality of information and type of control is presented. Nature of control is categorized by "validation" or "checking." Quality of information is assessed by an "informational rate" and some actual verbal exchanges illustrate this point. Findings show that control in the course of dialogues is determined by the quality of information sent by the caller initially.

37040162#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital health technologies using mobile apps and wearable devices are a promising approach to the investigation of substance use in the real world and for the analysis of predictive factors or harms from substance use. Moreover,, consecutive repeated data collection enables the development of predictive algorithms for substance use by machine learning methods.
37040162#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We developed a new self-monitoring mobile app to record daily substance use,, triggers,, and cravings. Additionally,, a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit) was used to collect objective biological and behavioral data before,, during,, and after substance use. This study aims to describe a model using machine learning methods to determine substance use.
37040162#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Enrollment for the trial began in September 2020,, and the data collection finished in April 2021. In total,, 13 people with methamphetamine use disorder and 36 with alcohol problems participated in this study. The severity of methamphetamine or alcohol use disorder assessed by the Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 or the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-10 was moderate to severe. The anticipated results of this study include understanding the physiological and behavioral data before,, during,, and after alcohol or methamphetamine use and identifying individual patterns of behavior.

37040162#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study is an ongoing observational study using a Fitbit and a self-monitoring app. Participants of this study were people with health risks due to alcohol or methamphetamine use. They were required to record their daily substance use and related factors on the self-monitoring app and to always wear a Fitbit for 8 weeks,, which collected the following data: (1) heart rate per minute,, (2) sleep duration per day,, (3) sleep stages per day,, (4) the number of steps per day,, and (5) the amount of physical activity per day. Fitbit data will first be visualized for data analysis to confirm typical Fitbit data patterns for individual users. Next,, machine learning and statistical analysis methods will be performed to create a detection model for substance use based on the combined Fitbit and self-monitoring data. The model will be tested based on 5-fold cross-validation,, and further preprocessing and machine learning methods will be conducted based on the preliminary results. The usability and feasibility of this approach will also be evaluated.
37040162#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Real-time data on daily life among people with substance use problems were collected in this study. This new approach to data collection might be helpful because of its high confidentiality and convenience. The findings of this study will provide data to support the development of interventions to reduce alcohol and methamphetamine use and associated negative consequences.

24841510#ABSTRACT##The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has promoted the use of telehealth technologies to deliver mental health care to veterans with limited access to services on account of geographic and other barriers. The use of technology to deliver interventions to veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been a particular focus within VHA. Much less attention has been paid to the use of telehealth technologies to diagnose veterans with PTSD for both treatment and/or disability compensation purposes,, in spite of the need for such services. The literature evaluating the use of video teleconferencing methods in the assessment of PTSD is limited; to our knowledge,, only 1 previous study has been published. The current study evaluated the psychometric characteristics of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) administered by video teleconferencing with a larger and more diverse sample of veterans. The CAPS raters had high interrater reliability and there were strong correlations between face-to-face CAPS assessments and video teleconferencing CAPS assessments for diagnosis and total severity. The results suggest that the CAPS can and should be used via video teleconferencing with veterans who have barriers to face-to-face evaluations.

36924375#ABSTRACT#MATERIAL AND METHODS#On 2 November 2022,, we conducted an observational cross-sectional descriptive study of all MHAs on KSD. A search in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store was performed. We reviewed all mobile apps from Apple App Store and Google Play Store for KSD and evaluated their usage in screening,, prevention,, management,, and adherence to EAU guidelines.
36924375#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total 13 MHA were included in the ?nal analysis. All MHAs,, 4 (30.8%) from the Apple App Store and 9 (69.2%) from the Google Play Store are geared towards the patient. Engagement ranged from 1.73 to 4.06; Functionality ranged from 3.17 to 4.75; Aesthetics ranged from 1.9 to 4.12; Information ranged from 2.25 to 4.27,, and Subjective quality ranged from 1.58 to 3.23. MHAs reported low and medium adherence to EAU guidelines.
36924375#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MHAs provide a very useful assistance in several medical ?elds,, including KSD. Despite MHAs development is constantly increasing,, the scienti?c validation,, content,, and quality are not yet solved. Future research is necessary to improve the quality of the apps and promote new user designed,, and high-quality apps.

28619701#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Depression is highly prevalent in the working population and is associated with significant loss of workdays; however,, access to evidence-based treatment is limited.
28619701#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study evaluated the effectiveness of a Web-based intervention in reducing mild to moderate depression and sickness absence.
28619701#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In an open-label randomized controlled trial,, participants were recruited from a large-scale statutory health insurance and were assigned to two groups. The intervention group had access to a 12 week Web-based program consisting of structured interactive sessions and therapist support upon request. The wait-list control group had access to unguided Web-based psycho-education. Depressive symptoms were self-assessed at baseline,, post-treatment,, and follow-up (12 weeks after treatment) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) as primary outcome measures. Data on sickness absence was retrieved from health insurance records. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and per-protocol (PP) analysis were performed.

28619701#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 180 participants who were randomized,, 88 completed the post-assessment (retention rate: 48.8%,, 88/180). ITT analysis showed a significant between-group difference in depressive symptoms during post-treatment in favor of the intervention group,, corresponding to a moderate effect size (PHQ-9: d=0.55,, 95% CI 0.25-0.85,, P<.001,, and BDI-II: d=0.41,, CI 0.11-0.70,, P=.004). PP analysis partially supported this result,, but showed a non-significant effect on one primary outcome (PHQ-9: d=0.61,, 95% CI 0.15-1.07,, P=.04,, and BDI-II: d=0.25 95% CI -0.18 to 0.65,, P=.37). Analysis of clinical significance using reliable change index revealed that significantly more participants who used the Web-based intervention (63%,, 63/100) responded to the treatment versus the control group (33%,, 27/80; P<.001). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 4.08. Within both groups,, there was a reduction in work absence frequency (IG: -67.23%,, P<.001,, CG: -82.61%,, P<.001),, but no statistical difference in sickness absence between groups was found (P=.07).
28619701#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Web-based intervention was effective in reducing depressive symptoms among adults with sickness absence. As this trial achieved a lower power than calculated,, its results should be replicated in a larger sample. Further validation of health insurance records as an outcome measure for eHealth trials is needed.

20703913#ABSTRACT##Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological illness which impairs motor skills,, speech,, and other functions such as mood,, behavior,, thinking,, and sensation. It causes vocal impairment for approximately 90% of the patients. As the symptoms of PD occur gradually and mostly targeting the elderly people for whom physical visits to the clinic are inconvenient and costly,, telemonitoring of the disease using measurements of dysphonia (vocal features) has a vital role in its early diagnosis. Such dysphonia features extracted from the voice come in variety and most of them are interrelated. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to select a minimal subset of features with maximal joint relevance to the PD-score,, a binary score indicating whether or not the sample belongs to a person with PD; and (2) to build a predictive model with minimal bias (i.e. to maximize the generalization of the predictions so as to perform well with unseen test examples). For these tasks,, we apply the mutual information measure with the permutation test for assessing the relevance and the statistical significance of the relations between the features and the PD-score,, rank the features according to the maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR) criterion,, use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for building a classification model and test it with a more suitable cross-validation scheme that we called leave-one-individual-out that fits with the dataset in hand better than the conventional bootstrapping or leave-one-out validation methods.

35285817#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The global burden of disease attributes 20% of deaths to poor nutrition. Although hundreds of nutrition-related mobile apps have been created,, and these have been downloaded by millions of users,, the effectiveness of these technologies on the adoption of healthy eating has had mixed.
35285817#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to review which nutrition-related mobile apps are currently available on the French market and assess their quality.
35285817#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We screened apps on the Google Play Store and the French Apple App Store,, from March 10 to 17,, 2021,, to identify those related to nutritional health. A shortlist of 15 apps was identified,, and each was assessed using the French version of the Mobile App Rating Scale: 8 dietitians and nutritionists assessed 7 apps,, and the remaining apps were randomly allocated to ensure 4 assessments per app. Intraclass correlation was used to evaluate interrater agreement. Means and standard deviations of scores for each section and each item were calculated.
35285817#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The top scores for overall quality were obtained by Yazio - Régime et Calories (mean 3.84,, SD 0.32),, FeelEat (mean 3.71,, SD 0.47),, and Bonne App (mean 3.65,, SD 0.09). Engagement scores ranged from a mean of 1.95 (SD 0.5) for iEatBetter: Journal alimentaire to a mean of 3.85 (SD 0.44) for FeelEat. Functionality scores ranged from a mean of 2.25 (SD 0.54) for Naor to a mean of 4.25 (SD 0.46) for Yazio. Aesthetics scores ranged from a mean of 2.17 (SD 0.34) for Naor to a mean of 3.88 (SD 0.47) for Yazio. Information scores ranged from a mean of 2.38 (SD 0.60) for iEatBetter to a mean of 3.73 (SD 0.29) for Yazio. Subjective quality scores ranged from a mean of 1.13 (SD 0.25) for iEatBetter to a mean of 2.28 (SD 0.88) for Compteur de calories FatSecret. Specificity scores ranged from a mean of 1.38 (SD 0.64) for iEatBetter to a mean of 3.50 (SD 0.91) for FeelEat. The app-specific score was always lower than the subjective quality score,, which was always lower than the quality score,, which was lower than the rating from the iOS or Android app stores.
35285817#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Although prevention and information messages in apps regarding nutritional habits are not scientifically verified before marketing,, we found that app quality was good. Subjective quality and specificity were associated with lower ratings. Further investigations are needed to assess whether information from these apps is consistent with recommendations and to determine the long-term impacts of these apps on users.

17306222#ABSTRACT##Administration of psychological questionnaires via the Internet has gained popularity in recent years and touts many advantages. However,, before questionnaires that were originally developed as paper-and-pencil measures can be confidently administered over the Internet,, it is necessary to document the equivalence of the paper and computer-generated versions [American Psychological Association.

Equivalence of computerized and conventional versions of the Beck Depression Inventory- II (BDI-II). Current Psychology: Developmental,, Learning,, Personality,, Social,, 20,, 216-230]. The current study tested this equivalence for the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory [Foa,, E.B.,, Kozak,, M.J.,, Salkovskis,, P.M,, Coles,, M.E.,, & Amir,, N. (1998).

Behaviour Research and Therapy,, 43,, 1527-1543] in an unselected student sample. Study results support the equivalence of these measures of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and beliefs independent of administration method (paper versus secure project website). These findings create new opportunities for conducting OCD-related research online.

26598228#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND & AIMS#Mobile health technologies are advancing rapidly as smartphone use increases. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) might be managed remotely through smartphone applications,, but no tools are yet available. We tested the ability of an IBD monitoring tool,, which can be used with mobile technologies,, to assess disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
26598228#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed a prospective observational study to develop and validate a mobile health index for CD and UC,, which monitors IBD disease activity using patient-reported outcomes. We collected data from disease-specific questionnaires completed by 110 patients with CD and 109 with UC who visited the University of California,, Los Angeles,, Center for IBD from May 2013 through January 2014. Patient-reported outcomes were compared with clinical disease activity index scores to identify factors associated with disease activity. Index scores were validated in 301 patients with CD and 265 with UC who visited 3 tertiary IBD referral centers (in California or Europe) from April 2014 through March 2015.

The indices identified clinical disease activity with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.90 in patients with CD and 0.91 in patients with UC. They identified endoscopic activity with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.63 in patients with CD and 0.82 in patients with UC. Both scoring systems responded to changes in disease activity (P < .003). The intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.94 for CD and for UC.
26598228#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We developed and validated a scoring system to monitor disease activity in patients with CD and UC that can be used with mobile technologies. The indices identified clinical disease activity with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.9 or higher in patients with CD or UC,, and endoscopic activity in patients with UC but not CD.

34142263#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To evaluate the concordance between Google Maps® application (GM®) and clinical practice measurements of ambulatory function (e.g.,, Ambulation Score (AS) and respective Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).
34142263#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#This is a cross-sectional multicenter study. AS and EDSS were calculated using GM® and routine clinical methods; the correspondence between the two methods was assessed. A multinomial logistic model is investigated which demographic (age,, sex) and clinical features (e.g.,, disease subtype,, fatigue,, depression) might have influenced discrepancies between the two methods.
34142263#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Two hundred forty-three pwMS were included; discrepancies in AS and in EDDS assessments between GM® and routine clinical methods were found in 81/243 (33.3%) and 74/243 (30.4%) pwMS,, respectively. Progressive phenotype (odds ratio [OR]?=?2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-7.11,, p?=?0.03),, worse fatigue (OR?=?1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06,, p?=?0.01),, and more severe depression (OR?=?1.1; 95% CI 1.04-1.17,, p?=?0.002) were associated with discrepancies between GM® and routine clinical scoring.
34142263#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#GM® could easily be used in a real-life clinical setting to calculate the AS and the related EDSS scores. GM® should be considered for validation in further clinical studies.

30002725#ABSTRACT##Mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is an emerging area that has received increasing attention in recent years,, but still real-life validation for elderly residing in low and middle-income countries is scarce. We developed a wearable ECG monitor that is integrated with a self-designed wireless sensor for ECG signal acquisition. It is used with a native purposely designed smartphone application,, based on machine learning techniques,, for automated classification of captured ECG beats from aged people. When tested on 100 older adults,, the monitoring system discriminated normal and abnormal ECG signals with a high degree of accuracy (97%),, sensitivity (100%),, and specificity (96.6%). With further verification,, the system could be useful for detecting cardiac abnormalities in the home environment and contribute to prevention,, early diagnosis,, and effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases,, while keeping costs down and increasing access to healthcare services for older persons.

34106073#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the development and persistence of chronic diseases. Mobile health apps that foster physical activity have the potential to assist in behavior change. However,, the quality of the mobile health apps available in app stores is hard to assess for making informed decisions by end users and health care providers.
34106073#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed at systematically reviewing and analyzing the content and quality of physical activity apps available in the 2 major app stores (Google Play and App Store) by using the German version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS-G). Moreover,, the privacy and security measures were assessed.
34106073#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A web crawler was used to systematically search for apps promoting physical activity in the Google Play store and App Store. Two independent raters used the MARS-G to assess app quality. Further,, app characteristics,, content and functions,, and privacy and security measures were assessed. The correlation between user star ratings and MARS was calculated. Exploratory regression analysis was conducted to determine relevant predictors for the overall quality of physical activity apps.
34106073#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 2231 identified apps,, 312 met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that the overall quality was moderate (mean 3.60 [SD 0.59],, range 1-4.75). The scores of the subscales,, that is,, information (mean 3.24 [SD 0.56],, range 1.17-4.4),, engagement (mean 3.19 [SD 0.82],, range 1.2-5),, aesthetics (mean 3.65 [SD 0.79],, range 1-5),, and functionality (mean 4.35 [SD 0.58],, range 1.88-5) were obtained. An efficacy study could not be identified for any of the included apps. The features of data security and privacy were mainly not applied. Average user ratings showed significant small correlations with the MARS ratings (r=0.22,, 95% CI 0.08-0.35; P<.001). The amount of content and number of functions were predictive of the overall quality of these physical activity apps,, whereas app store and price were not.
34106073#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Apps for physical activity showed a broad range of quality ratings,, with moderate overall quality ratings. Given the present privacy,, security,, and evidence concerns inherent to most rated apps,, their medical use is questionable. There is a need for open-source databases of expert quality ratings to foster informed health care decisions by users and health care providers.

36713001#ABSTRACT#AIMS#High blood pressure (BP) is the commonest modifiable cardiovascular risk factor,, yet its monitoring remains problematic. Wearable cuffless BP devices offer potential solutions; however,, little is known about their validity and utility. We aimed to systematically review the validity,, features and clinical use of wearable cuffless BP devices.
36713001#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS# 87.1%).
36713001#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Several cuffless BP devices are currently available using different technologies,, offering the potential for continuous BP monitoring. The variation in standards and validation protocols limited the comparability of findings across studies and the identification of the most accurate device. Challenges such as validation using standard protocols and in real-life settings must be overcome before they can be recommended for uptake into clinical practice.

36287606#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Rapid advances in mobile apps for clinical data collection for pain evaluation have resulted in more efficient data handling and analysis than traditional paper-based approaches. As paper-based visual analogue scale (p-VAS) scores are commonly used to assess pain levels,, new emerging apps need to be validated prior to clinical application with symptomatic children and adolescents.
36287606#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of an electronic visual analogue scale (e-VAS) method via a mobile health (mHealth) App in children and adolescents diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder/hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (HSD/HEDS) in comparison with the traditional p-VAS.
36287606#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Children diagnosed with HSD/HEDS aged 5-18 years were recruited from a sports medicine center in Sydney (New South Wales,, Australia). Consenting participants assigned in random order to the e-VAS and p-VAS platforms were asked to indicate their current lower limb pain level and completed pain assessment e-VAS or p-VAS at one time point. Instrument agreement between the 2 methods was determined from the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and through Bland-Altman analysis.
36287606#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 43 children with HSD/HEDS aged 11 (SD 3.8) years were recruited and completed this study. The difference between the 2 VAS platforms of median values was 0.20. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a difference of 0.19 (SD 0.95) with limits of agreement ranging -1.67 to 2.04. An ICC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.93) indicated good reliability.

The e-VAS App can be reliably used for pediatric pain evaluation,, and it could potentially be introduced into daily clinical practice to improve real-time symptom monitoring. Further research is warranted to investigate the usage of the app for remote support in real clinical settings.

32155976#ABSTRACT##One in three adults worldwide has hypertension,, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Consequently,, there is a global demand for continuous and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements that are convenient,, easy to use,, and more accurate than the currently available methods for detecting hypertension. This could easily be achieved through the integration of single-site photoplethysmography (PPG) readings into wearable devices,, although improved reliability and an understanding of BP estimation accuracy are essential. This review paper focuses on understanding the features of PPG associated with BP and examines the development of this technology over the 2010-2019 period in terms of validation,, sample size,, diversity of subjects,, and datasets used. Challenges and opportunities to move single-site PPG forward are also discussed.

34915855#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Impaired motor function is one of the early symptoms shown in patients with Parkinson Disease (PD). For this reason,, rehabilitative interventions have been used for many years to improve motor and non-motor symptoms. Among them,, the use of music therapy has shown benefits in helping to overcome some of the most common motor dysfunction. Addressing the challenge of providing access to this type of therapy,, this document presents the collaborative design process to develop a remote training support tool for PD based on music therapy.
34915855#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A qualitative study with creative co-design methods was used in which different groups of healthcare professionals,, patients,, and relatives participated in six iterative sessions. Workshops were designed and structured to incrementally discover requirements and needs and validate the proposed prototype ideas.
34915855#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The study provided key aspects that were used for the development and validation of the proposed prototypes for the remote music-based training support tool for PD. Up to 20 factors that had a positive and/or negative influence on patient access to training were detected. These factors were classified into three common themes: daily activities and independence,, participation in treatment and barriers to daily treatment,, and self-management and personalization of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT).

29359588#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND:#There are few telemedicine projects in Africa that have reached scale. One of the reasons proposed for this has been failure to assess health provider readiness for telemedicine prior to implementation.
29359588#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE:#To assess health provider readiness for implementation and integration of telemedicine services at three levels of Uganda's health facilities,, namely,, a national referral hospital (NRH),, regional referral hospitals (RRHs) and level 4 health centres (HC-IVs) and to investigate factors associated with readiness for telemedicine.
29359588#ABSTRACT#METHOD:#A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at public healthcare facilities in Uganda. One RRH and HC-IV was identified from each of the Western,, Eastern and Northern regions using a multistage random sampling technique. Mulago Hospital,, which doubles as an RRH and HC-IV in the central region,, was purposively identified for the study. After validation,, a questionnaire was distributed for self-administration to senior administrators and doctors selected at the NRH,, RRHs and HC-IVs. Data were analysed using bivariate associations between the outcome and the potential independent variables.
29359588#ABSTRACT#RESULTS:#In total,, 114 healthcare workers completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents,, 24 (21%) were from HC-IVs,, 44 (39%) were from RRHs,, and 46 (40%) from NRH. Doctors made up 45.8% (11) of respondents at HC-IVs,, 59% (26) at RRHs,, and 30.4% (14) at NRH. Administrators across all health facility levels were more likely to integrate telemedicine into the healthcare system than doctors (odd ratio = 1.39 [95% confidence interval = 0.38-4.95]). A significant association existed between the state of readiness and type of health facility,, p < 0.001. The NRH and RRHs are more likely to integrate telemedicine into their systems than the HC-IVs. Among the factors investigated (job title,, health facility,, technology type,, reason for referral and frequency of electronic communication),, the level of health facility and title or role of healthcare worker were found to have a significant statistical association with being ready to integrate telemedicine into the healthcare system.
29359588#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION:#Health provider readiness to integrate telemedicine services varies at the different levels of the health facility and job title or role. However,, referral hospitals and administrators were more likely to integrate telemedicine than HC-IVs and doctors,, respectively. While this study shows physicians and administrators are ready,, other sectors (nurses,, allied healthcare workers,, public) will also need to be assessed.

33380619#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The objective of this study was to identify and validate smartphone-based visual acuity (VA) apps that can be used in a teleophthalmology portal.
33380619#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was conducted in three phases: A survey to investigate if the SmartOptometry App was easy to download,, understand and test (phase I),, an in-clinic comparison of VA measured in a random testing order with four tools namely COMPlog,, Reduced Snellen near vision,, Peek Acuity (Distance VA) and SmartOptometry (Near VA) (phase II) and a repeatability study on these 4 tools by measuring VA again (phase III). The study recruited the employees of our institute and adhered to the strict COVID-19 protocols of testing.
33380619#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Phase I Survey (n = 40) showed 90% of participants used android phones,, 60% reported that instructions were clear,, and all users were able to self-assess their near VA with SmartOptometry App. Phase II (n = 68) revealed that Peek Acuity was comparable to COMPlog VA (P = 0.31),, however SmartOptometry was statistically significantly different (within 2 log MAR lines) from Reduced Snellen near vision test,, particularly for young (n = 44,, P = 0.004) and emmetropic (n = 16,, P = 0.04) participants. All the 4 tests were found to be repeatable in phase III (n = 10) with a coefficient of repeatability =0.14.
33380619#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Smartphone-based apps were easy to download and can be used for checking patient's distance and near visual acuity. An effect of age and refractive error should be considered when interpreting the results. Further studies with real-time patients are required to identify potential benefits and challenges to solve.

17359573#ABSTRACT##We developed a telemedicine protocol for diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Assessments by video-conferencing (remote) were compared with face to face (direct) assessments. Eight physicians performed direct assessments and two physicians conducted remote assessments. There was alternate allocation of direct or remote initial assessment. The participants were 20 subjects over 65 years living in a rural area and referred by general practitioners (GPs) because of cognitive impairment. Each assessment included a Standardised Mini Mental State Examination,, Geriatric Depression Scale,, Katz assessment of Activities of Daily Living,, Instrumental ADL assessment,, and the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Laboratory results and radiological imaging were available from referring GPs. There was good agreement for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease between telemedicine and direct assessment,, kappa = 0.8 (P<0.0001). However,, because of the small sample size,, the presence of systematic bias could not be completely excluded. We conclude that it is possible to diagnose AD at a distance using telemedicine,, but this requires validation with a larger study.
8617451#ABSTRACT##Telepathology affords the means to provide pathological diagnosis and consultation to remote sites. However,, before telepathology can become an acceptable medical tool,, it will be vital to determine the diagnostic accuracy of this technology. We report the results of a single-blind study of the accuracy of diagnosis performed using computerized still images obtained from a telepathology workstation used in a French telepathology network. Four pathologists,, each working alone,, reviewed a total of 200 cases of routine surgical pathology (50 cases each),, and performed diagnosis based on both computer CD-ROM still images (CD) and conventional glass slides (GS). Concordance between GS and CD diagnosis,, as well as accuracy,, were determined. Other factors related to performance were also measured,, including diagnostic certainty,, reasons for uncertainty,, and causes of diagnostic error. Overall,, there was good agreement between CS and CD diagnosis. There was 87.5% concordance between CS and CD diagnosis,, and comparison to consensus (correct) diagnosis showed accuracy of 95.5% and 88.5% for GS and CD diagnosis,, respectively. Marked variability in accuracy of CD diagnosis was observed among the four pathologists,, and issues related to image selection and/or quality appeared responsible for 60% of the diagnostic errors. The lack of sufficient images and clinical information were frequently cited as reasons for diagnostic uncertainty,, as well as feelings of insufficient expertise. It is likely that the opportunity for interaction with the referring pathologist and the use of subspecialty consultants would likely improve the performance of telepathology.

29769174#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Overweight and obesity have become major health problems globally with more than 1.9 billion overweight adults. In Lebanon,, the prevalence of obesity and overweight is 65.4% combined. Risk factors of obesity and overweight are preventable and can be addressed by modifications in the environment and in an individual's lifestyle. Mobile technologies are increasingly used in behavioral,, self-directed weight management interventions,, providing users with additional opportunities to attain weight control (weight loss,, weight gain prevention,, etc). Mobile apps may allow for the delivery of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs),, which provide support through skill building,, emotional support,, and instrumental support,, following the participants' progress. A few commercially available apps offer JITAI features,, but no studies have tested their efficacy.
29769174#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The primary objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of a self-directed weight loss intervention,, targeting employees of an academic institution,, using a virtual coaching app with JITAI features (Lark) and a self-help calorie-counting app (MyFitnessPal). The secondary objective is to estimate the effects of the intervention on main study outcomes.
29769174#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study is a single-center,, parallel,, randomized controlled trial with 2 study arms (intervention and control). Participants will be randomly allocated in equal proportions to the intervention (Lark) and control groups (MyFitnessPal). To be eligible for this study,, participants must be employed full- or part-time at the university or its medical center,, able to read English,, have a smartphone,, and be interested in controlling their weight. Recruitment strategies entail email invitations,, printed posters,, and social media postings. We will assess quantitative rates of recruitment,, adherence,, and retention,, self-reported app quality using the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale. We will also assess changes in weight-related outcomes (absolute weight and waist circumference),, behavioral outcomes (physical activity and diet),, and cognitive factors (motivation to participate in the trial and to manage weight).
29769174#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#WaznApp was funded in June 2017,, and recruitment started in March 2018.

33690142#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The COVID-19 pandemic has forced drastic changes to daily life,, from the implementation of stay-at-home orders to mandating facial coverings and limiting in-person gatherings. While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically,, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States,, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing.
33690142#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here,, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020.
33690142#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville,, TN. Graduate students,, postdoctoral fellows,, faculty,, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode.
33690142#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Between June 17,, 2020,, and July 29,, 2020,, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users,, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in,, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall,, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie,, asymptomatic with no known exposures),, and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR,, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk,, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users,, and in 19 of these instances,, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus.
33690142#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing,, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake,, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools,, including MyCOVIDKey,, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.

35594073#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health apps can support the self-management of pediatric asthma. Previous studies on mobile apps for children aged >7 years with asthma are limited,, and most reports on asthma apps do not consider interactions between the children and their caregivers. Therefore,, we developed an asthma app for children aged 0-12 years and their caregivers based on the results of our previous study regarding user needs.
35594073#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a developed mobile app for children with asthma and their caregivers and to modify and complete the app according to the feasibility results.
35594073#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We recruited children diagnosed with persistent asthma by an allergy specialist at 2 children's hospitals,, 1 university hospital,, 2 general hospitals,, and 1 pediatric clinic. Thereafter,, the app usage was assessed,, and questionnaires were administered. This study used convergent mixed methods,, including providing user feedback about the pediatric asthma app,, completing questionnaire surveys regarding preferences,, and obtaining quantitative data about app usage. Quantitative data were analyzed based on the ratings provided for the app features used by the participants,, and the usage of the app features was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed via a descriptive qualitative research analysis and were used to identify codes from the content-characteristic words.
35594073#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The app feasibility among children with asthma and their caregivers was generally good. Children aged 7-12 years used elements such as record,, quiz,, and manga. This app can support the continuous self-management of pediatric asthma. However,, efforts must be taken to maintain and improve the app quality.

35594073#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 30 pairs of children aged 2-12 years and their caregivers responded to the 3-month survey,, and 20 pairs of children aged 4-12 years and their caregivers responded to the 6-month survey. In the 3- and 6-month surveys,, "record" was the most commonly used feature by both caregivers and children. The average access logs per month among the 20 pairs ranged from 50 to 79 in the 6-month survey. The number of access logs decreased over time. In the qualitative results,, app utilization difficulties were identified for 6 categories: record,, preparing,, alert settings,, change settings,, mobile phone owner,, and display and motivation. Regarding app feasibility,, 60% (12/20) of the caregivers strongly agreed or agreed for all evaluation items,, while 63% (7/11) of the children strongly agreed or agreed for 6 items,, excluding satisfaction. In the qualitative results,, feasibility evaluation of the app was classified into 3 categories: high feasibility of the app,, improvement points for the app,, and personal factors preventing app utilization. Based on the results of the feasibility analysis,, the final version of the app was modified and completed.

24841632#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This article presents the development of a telehealthcare decision support system (TDSS) for patients discharged from the hospital,, where symptom data are important indications of the recovery progress for patients. Symptom data are difficult to quantify in a telehealthcare application scenario because the observations and perceptions on symptoms by the patient themselves are subjective. In the TDSS,, both symptom data from patients and clinical histories from the hospital information system are collected. Machine learning algorithms are used to build a predictive model for classifying patients according to their symptom data and clinical histories,, to provide a degree of urgency for the patient to return to the hospital.

24841632#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#During a 1-year period,, 1,,467 patient cases were collected. Symptom data and clinical histories were preprocessed into 49 parameters for machine learning. The training data of patients were validated manually with their actual clinical histories of returning to the hospital. The performances of predictive models trained by five different machine learning algorithms were evaluated and compared.
24841632#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Bayesian network algorithm had the best performance among the machine learning algorithms tested in this application scenario and was selected to be implemented in the TDSS. On the 1,,467 patient cases collected,, its precision in 10-fold cross-validation was 79.3%. The most important six parameters were also selected from the 49 parameters by feature selection. The performance of correct prediction by the TDSS is comparable to that by the nursing team at the call center.
24841632#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The TDSS provides a degree of urgency for patients to return to the hospital and thereby assists the telehealthcare nursing team in making such decisions. The performance of the TDSS is expected to improve as more cases of patient data are collected and input into the TDSS. The TDSS has been implemented in one of the largest commercialized telehealthcare practices in Taiwan administered by Min-Sheng General Hospital.

29084010#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#Depression is a complex and burdensome condition; it often leads to personal,, societal and economic costs. Despite advances in treatments,, its management over time remains a challenge; many treated for depression do not achieve full recovery or remain well for long. Novel ways to monitor patients are warranted,, as well as better understanding of contributors to relapse or sustained wellness. Mobile health technologies (m-Health) are emerging as useful tools for real-time assessments of moods,, behaviours and activities in a more convenient and less burdensome manner. Yet,, there are numerous questions around privacy,, reliability and accuracy of data collected via mobile apps. This review provides a critical overview of advances in m-Health and evaluate the future potential of smartphone technology in the assessment and treatment of depression.
9041828#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians viewing a patient's history and static digital image set compared with clinicians who conducted office-based physical examinations of the same patients.
9041828#ABSTRACT#SETTING AND PATIENTS#One hundred sixteen adult patients presenting with dermatologic symptoms in a university-based practice who consented to have their skin conditions documented with a still digital camera according to a standardized protocol.
9041828#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES#Concordance between office-based dermatologists' diagnoses and 2 remote clinicians' diagnoses using still digital images (resolution,, 92 dots per inch) and identical medical history data to render diagnoses.
9041828#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#When photographic quality was high and office-based clinician certainty was high,, remote clinicians were in agreement more than 75% of the time. Office-based and remote clinicians were in agreement 61% to 64% of the time for all cases. No specific disease category appeared to be more or less amenable to diagnosis based on still digital imagery. The diagnostic certainty of the office-based clinician (reported from 0-10) had the most impact on agreement. When cases with office-based clinician certainty of no more than 7 were compared with cases with certainty of at least 9,, agreement increased 54% for remote clinician 1 and 111% for remote clinician 2. As an isolated variable,, photographic quality had a modest impact on agreement.
9041828#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Still digital images can substitute for the dermatologic physical examination in up to 83% of cases. This study provides validation of the store-and-forward concept of telemedicine as applied to dermatology. These results serve as the foundation for field testing of the concept in primary care settings.

32767579#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#This study aimed to validate dermatologic ultrasound as a complementary teledermatologic imaging modality in primary and tertiary care centers.
32767579#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Six primary care centers and 1 tertiary care dermatology department collaborated in the program. Images were sent through the institutional teledermatologic platform to the tertiary care dermatology department. At the reference hospital,, ultrasound images and clinical data were received and registered by a physician trained in dermatologic ultrasound. An in-person consultation was scheduled to confirm the teleultrasound diagnosis. The time of response by the tertiary center,, quality and size of the teledermatologic image,, and concordance with the in-person diagnosis were assessed for each dermatologic lesion.
32767579#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 147 teleultrasound consultations with 143 patients (93 women and 50 men; mean age?±?SD,, 47?±?23?years) were evaluated between June 2018 and January 2019. Nine teleultrasound consultations (6.1%) were not valid. Discordance between teleultrasound and the in-person diagnosis was evident in 6 of 138 cases (4.3%). Most cases corresponded to benign skin tumors (66.7%),, followed by inflammatory skin lesions (15.9%),, nonmelanoma skin lesions (13%),, and other skin lesions (4.3%). All malignant tumors were detected (sensitivity,, 100%),, although 2 cases of benign lesions were telediagnosed as malignant (specificity,, 97.8%). The positive and negative predictive values of a teleultrasound diagnosis of cutaneous malignancy were 90% and 100%,, respectively.
32767579#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Asynchronous primary care teleultrasound combined with dermatologic ultrasound training at tertiary centers is an effective teledermatologic modality.

18570547#ABSTRACT##The study goal was to evaluate the impact of the telemedicine consult on patients with chronic wounds. Thirty patients from long-term care skilled nursing facilities,, referred to the ambulatory wound care program for wound assessment and preparation of management plans,, were the subject of this prospective,, randomized trial. To facilitate communication with a surgical wound care specialist,, telemedicine feedback was provided prior to face-to-face consultation to 15 patients. The telemedicine consult included (1) wound assessment,, (2) rationale for the suggested wound management with emphasis on wound risk projections,, and (3) prevention and benefits of surgical intervention. This was communicated to the patient by the field wound care nurse. The telemedicine impact was measured by assessing the duration of the subsequent face-to-face consultation and patient satisfaction with further care decisions as well as by validation of a decisional conflict scale. The average duration of the face-to-face consultation was 50 +/- 12 minutes versus 35 +/- 6 (p < 0.01) minutes for patients subjected to the telemedicine feedback preceding the direct contact with the specialist. The telemedicine consult was found to be a useful aid in increasing the satisfaction rate from care decisions ultimately made during the direct consult (acceptance rate 93% vs. 47% in those subjected to treatment without the intermediate telemedicine consult,, p < 0.01). The decisional conflict as a state of uncertainty about the course of action to take was reduced in patients subjected to telemedicine decision aid. The average Decisional Conflict Scale score was 14 +/- 1.73 in patients subjected to telemedicine feedback as opposed to 35 +/- 4.26 (p < 0.001) in no-telemedicine contact. The telemedicine consult preceding face-to-face evaluation improved patient satisfaction and understanding of their care as well as increased the perception of shared decision making regarding the wound care.

28288104#ABSTRACT##The feasibility of using mobile health applications to conduct observational clinical studies requires rigorous validation. Here,, we report initial findings from the Asthma Mobile Health Study,, a research study,, including recruitment,, consent,, and enrollment,, conducted entirely remotely by smartphone. We achieved secure bidirectional data flow between investigators and 7,,593 participants from across the United States,, including many with severe asthma. Our platform enabled prospective collection of longitudinal,, multidimensional data (e.g.,, surveys,, devices,, geolocation,, and air quality) in a subset of users over the 6-month study period. Consistent trending and correlation of interrelated variables support the quality of data obtained via this method. We detected increased reporting of asthma symptoms in regions affected by heat,, pollen,, and wildfires. Potential challenges with this technology include selection bias,, low retention rates,, reporting bias,, and data security. These issues require attention to realize the full potential of mobile platforms in research and patient care.

27960232#ABSTRACT##Whole slide imaging is being used increasingly in research applications and in frozen section,, consultation and external quality assurance practice. Digital pathology,, when integrated with other digital tools such as barcoding,, specimen tracking and digital dictation,, can be integrated into the histopathology workflow,, from specimen accession to report sign-out. These elements can bring about improvements in the safety,, quality and efficiency of a histopathology department. The present paper reviews the evidence for these benefits. We then discuss the challenges of implementing a fully digital pathology workflow,, including the regulatory environment,, validation of whole slide imaging and the evidence for the design of a digital pathology workstation.

26218353#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Melanoma incidence is increasing globally,, but consistently accurate skin-lesion classification methods remain elusive. We developed a simple software system to classify potentially all types of skin lesions. In the current study,, we evaluated the system's ability to identify melanomas with a diameter of 10?mm or larger.
26218353#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#The skin-lesion classification system is composed of a proprietary database of nearly 12,,000 diagnosed skin-lesion images and a computer algorithm based on the principles of content-based image retrieval. The algorithm compares characteristics of new skin-lesion images with images in the database to identify the nearest-match diagnosis.
26218353#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Nearly all classification accuracy measures for this new system exceeded 90%,, with results for sensitivity of 90.4% (95% confidence interval,, 85.6-93.7%),, specificity of 91.5% (85.4-95.2%),, positive predictive value of 94.5% (90.4-96.9%),, negative predictive value of 85.5% (78.7-90.4%),, and overall classification accuracy of 90.8% (87.2-93.4%).
26218353#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The image-matching algorithm performed with high accuracy for the classification of larger melanomas. Furthermore,, the system does not require a dermoscope or any other specialized hardware; any close-focusing camera will do. This system has the potential to be an inexpensive and accurate tool for the evaluation of skin lesions in ethnically and geographically diverse populations.

31045504#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#To support the self-management of heart failure,, a team of hospital clinicians,, patients,, and family caregivers have co-designed the consumer mobile health app,, Care4myHeart.
31045504#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This research aimed to determine patient experiences of using the app to self-manage heart failure.
31045504#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients with heart failure used the app for 14 days on their own smart device in a home setting,, following which a mixed-methods evaluation was performed. Eight patients were recruited,, of whom six completed the Mobile Application Rating Scale and attended an interview.
22071338#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The internal consistency of the scale was sufficient: alpha = .93 in study 1 and alpha = .92 in study 2. In both studies the 8 items loaded on 1 single component (respectively 67% and 63% of variance). Correlations between eHEALS and age and education were not found. Significant,, though weak,, correlations were found between the eHEALS and quantity of Internet use (r = .24,, P = .001 and r = .24,, P = .02,, respectively). Contrary to expectations,, correlations between the eHEALS and successfully completed tasks on a performance test were weak and nonsignificant: r = .18 (P = .09). The t tests showed no significant differences in scores on the eHEALS between participants who scored below and above median scores of the performance test.
34463627#AUTHOR#4#Kennesaw State University,, Kennesaw,, GA,, United States.
31045504#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The overall app quality score was "acceptable" with 3.53 of 5 points,, with the aesthetics (3.83/5) and information (3.78/5) subscales scoring the highest. The lowest mean score was in the app-specific subscale representing the perceived impact on health behavior change (2.53/5). Frequently used features were weight and fluid restriction tracking,, with graphical representation of data particularly beneficial for improved self-awareness and ongoing learning. The use of technology for self-management will fundamentally differ from current practices and require a change in daily routines. However,, app use was correlated with potential utility for daily management of illness with benefits of accurate recording and review of personal health data and as a communication tool for doctors to assist with care planning,, as all medical information is available in one place. Technical considerations included participants' attitudes toward technology,, functionality and data entry issues,, and relatively minor suggested changes.
31045504#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings from this usability study suggest that a significant barrier to adoption is the lack of integration of technology into everyday life in the context of already established disease self-management routines. Future studies should explore the barriers to adoption and sustainability of consumer mobile health interventions for chronic conditions,, particularly whether introducing such apps is more beneficial at the commencement of a self-management regimen.

22071338#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Internet increases the availability of health information,, which consequently expands the amount of skills that health care consumers must have to obtain and evaluate health information. Norman and Skinner in 2006 developed an 8-item self-report eHealth literacy scale to measure these skills: the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). This instrument has been available only in English and there are no data on its validity.
22071338#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The objective of our study was to assess the internal consistency and the construct and predictive validity of a Dutch translation of the eHEALS in two populations.
22071338#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We examined the translated scale in a sample of patients with rheumatic diseases (n = 189; study 1) and in a stratified sample of the Dutch population (n = 88; study 2). We determined Cronbach alpha coefficients and analyzed the principal components. Convergent validity was determined by studying correlations with age,, education,, and current (health-related) Internet use. Furthermore,, in study 2 we assessed the predictive validity of the instrument by comparing scores on the eHEALS with an actual performance test.

22071338#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The eHEALS was assessed as unidimensional in a principal component analysis and the internal consistency of the scale was high,, which makes the reliability adequate. However,, findings suggest that the validity of the eHEALS instrument requires further study,, since the relationship with Internet use was weak and expected relationships with age,, education,, and actual performance were not significant. Further research to develop a self-report instrument with high correlations with people's actual eHealth literacy skills is warranted.

37127574#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Compensatory movements are commonly observed in older adults with stroke during upper extremity (UE) motor rehabilitation,, which could limit their motor recovery.
37127574#ABSTRACT#AIM#This study aims to develop a compensation-aware virtual rehabilitation system (VRS) that can detect compensatory movements and improve the outcome of UE rehabilitation in community-dwelling older adults with stroke.
37127574#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The VRS development includes three main components: (1) the use of thresholds for determining compensatory movements,, (2) the algorithm for processing the kinematic data stream from Kinect to detect compensation in real-time,, and (3) the audio-visual feedback to assist older adults with stroke to be aware of the compensation. Two studies were conducted following the VRS development,, where Study 1 identified the value of thresholds for determining compensatory movements in two planar motor exercises,, and Study 2 provided preliminary validation for the developed VRS by comparing two groups undergoing VR training or conventional training (CT) in a community rehabilitation center.
37127574#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The VRS could effectively detect all determined compensatory movements and timely trigger feedback in response to the detected compensatory movements. The VR participants showed significant improvements in Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE,, p?=?0.045) and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT,, p?=?0.009). However,, the VR and CT groups had no significant differences in outcome measures.
37127574#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The VRS demonstrates the ability to detect compensation and the potential of assisting older adults with stroke to improve motor functions. Suggestions are given for further improvements of the VRS to support the older adult with stroke to reduce compensation.

34463627#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) smartphone apps have shown promise in the self-management of chronic disease. In today's oversaturated health app market,, selection criteria that consumers are employing to choose mHealth apps for disease self-management are of paramount importance. App quality is critical in monitoring disease controls but is often linked to consumer popularity rather than clinical recommendations of effectiveness in disease management. Management of key disease variances can be performed through these apps to increase patient engagement in disease self-management. This paper provides a comprehensive review of features found in mHealth apps frequently used in the self- management of diabetes.
34463627#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study was to review features of frequently used and high consumer-rated mHealth apps used in the self-management of diabetes. This study aimed to highlight key features of consumer-favored mHealth apps used in the self-management of diabetes.
34463627#ABSTRACT#METHODS#,, insulin,, physical activity,, and prescription medication. A subsequent Google search was conducted using the search term "best Apple diabetes apps." The top 3 search results-"Healthline,," "Everyday Health,," and "Diabetes Apps-American Diabetes Association"-were explored.
34463627#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 12 mHealth apps were reviewed due to their appearing across 4 evaluated sources. Only 1 health app-Glucose Buddy Diabetes Tracker-appeared as the most frequently used within the Apple iOS store and across the other 3 sources. The OneTouch Reveal app ranked first on the list in the iOS store with 39,,000 consumer reviews and a rating of 4.7 out of 5.0 stars but only appeared in 1 of the other 3 sources. Blood glucose tracking was present across all apps,, but other disease management features varied in type with at least 3 of the 5 key features being present across the 12 reviewed apps. Subscription cost and integration needs were present in the apps which could impact consumers' decision to select apps. Although mobile app preference was assessed and defined by the number of consumer reviews and star ratings,, there were no scientific standards used in the selection and ranking of the health apps within this study.
34463627#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#mHealth apps have shown promise in chronic disease management,, but a surge in development of these nonregulated health solutions points to a need for regulation,, standardization,, and quality control. A governing body of health IT professionals,, clinicians,, policymakers,, payors,, and patients could be beneficial in defining health app standards for effective chronic disease management. Variabilities in features,, cost,, and other aspects of management could be reduced by regulatory uniformity,, which would increase patient engagement and improve disease outcomes.

35679867#ABSTRACT#AIM OF THE STUDY#The digital transformation in healthcare is also of fundamental importance for healthcare research. For this reason,, experts should agree on,, prioritize and identify key topics for a medium-term strategy of the German Network for Health Services Research and classify the general development of digital health in the context of health services research.
35679867#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Between April and September 2018,, the working groups "Digital Health" and "Validation and Linkage of Secondary Data" of the German Network for Health Services Research were asked to submit their expertise online using the methodological approach of a Delphi study. For this purpose,, a multi-stage modified Delphi method with quantitative and qualitative approaches was chosen. Initially,, a list of theses was drawn from the network's published position papers on digital health applications and medical apps. A total of 131 statements were formulated. The final survey instrument included questions on the biographical background of the participants,, 42 developed items (33 statements and 8 open-ended questions),, and one free-text field to add further aspects. Items were evaluated with a five-point Likert scale. A statement was accepted if the agreement rate was 75% or higher.
35679867#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 110 potential participants,, 50 (46%) took part in the first round and 39 (36%) in the second round of the Delphi survey. In the first round,, there was a clear result for 24 of 33 statements. There were 20 statements "agreed with" and four "disagreed with." Nine statements were between 60 and 75% and were presented to the participants again for evaluation in the second round. In round two,, of these nine statements,, four statements were "agreed with" and five statements were "disagreed with." Digital Health Literacy" emerged as a particular focus in this Delphi study.
35679867#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#In this Delphi study,, experts were involved in selecting and prioritizing possible topics for the Digital Health working group and assessing future developments in digital health in the context of health services research. The results reflect both the expectations and interests of the members and are largely consistent with the recommendations of the report "Digitalization for Health" made by the expert council for assessing developments in the health sector.

31007055#ABSTRACT##In this descriptive,, qualitative study,, we conducted eight focus groups with diverse informal and formal caregivers to explore their experiences/challenges with nursing home (NH) to emergency department (ED) transfers and whether telehealth might be able to mitigate some of those concerns. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Transfers were commonly viewed as being influenced by a perceived lack of trust in NH care/capabilities and driven by four main factors: questioning the quality of NH nurses' assessments,, perceptions that physicians were absent from the NH,, misunderstandings of the capabilities of NHs and EDs,, and perceptions that responses to medical needs were inadequate. Participants believed technology could provide "the power of the visual" permitting virtual assessment for the off-site physician,, validation of nursing assessment,, "real time" assurance to residents and families,, better goals of care discussions with multiple parties in different locations,, and family ability to say goodbye.

34889768#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There is an increasing amount of electronic data sitting within the health system. These data have untapped potential to improve clinical practice if extracted efficiently and harnessed to change the behavior of health professionals. Furthermore,, there is an increasing expectation from the government and peak bodies that both individual health professionals and health care organizations will use electronic data for a range of applications,, including improving health service delivery and informing clinical practice and professional accreditation.
34889768#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this research program is to make eHealth data captured within tertiary health care organizations more actionable to health professionals for use in practice reflection,, professional development,, and other quality improvement activities.
34889768#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A multidisciplinary approach was used to connect academic experts from core disciplines of health and medicine,, education and learning sciences,, and engineering and information communication technology with government and health service partners to identify key problems preventing the health care industry from using electronic data to support health professional learning. This multidisciplinary approach was used to design a large-scale research program to solve the problem of making eHealth data more accessible to health professionals for practice reflection. The program will be delivered over 5 years by doctoral candidates undertaking research projects with discrete aims that run in parallel to achieving this program's objectives.
34889768#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The process used to develop the research program identified 7 doctoral research projects to answer the program objectives,, split across 3 streams.
34889768#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This research program has the potential to successfully unpack electronic data siloed within clinical sites and enable health professionals to use them to reflect on their practice and deliver informed and improved care. The program will contribute to current practices by fostering stronger connections between industry and academia,, interlinking doctoral research projects to solve complex problems,, and creating new knowledge for clinical sites on how data can be used to understand and improve performance. Furthermore,, the program aims to affect policy by developing insights on how professional development programs may be strengthened to enhance their alignment with clinical practice. The key contributions of this paper include the introduction of a new conceptualized research program,, Practice Analytics in Health care,, by describing the foundational academic disciplines that the program is formed of and presenting scientific methods for its design and development.

35584517#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has opened opportunities for service providers and patients to continue with clinical services in certain extraordinary settings and circumstances. Telerehabilitation in the field of speech language pathology in India is still at its infancy,, with a majority of the Speech Language Pathologists (SLP) accustomed with the conventional face-to-face system of service delivery. The present study aims to gather the knowledge,, attitudes,, and practices (KAP) of SLPs in India regarding telerehabilitation services during the pandemic.
35584517#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was conducted in three phases: phase I involved the development and validation of a questionnaire to explore the KAP of SLPs regarding telerehabilitation services. The items were framed based on a Likert rating scale (strongly agree,, agree,, neutral,, disagree,, and strongly disagree),, yes-no-maybe format,, open-ended,, and multiple-choice format. Phase II involved data collection,, while phase III involved data analysis. Descriptive statistics was done to derive the frequency and percentage for discrete variables and mean and SD for continuous variables.
35584517#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Many SLPs feel underprepared in their technical knowledge and skills needed for telerehabilitation. Furthermore,, a majority of the SLPs also did report patients to be relatively lesser motivated and satisfied with tele practices due to issues that are discussed in the paper.

25748268#ABSTRACT##Digital health tools are providing patients with easier ways to keep track of their blood glucose levels and other key self-reported data,, such as carbohydrates ingested,, medication administered,, and physical activity. Data are often uploaded into the cloud where physicians and other members of the care team can access them. Clinical studies are beginning to demonstrate efficacy of some of these tools,, and Food and Drug Administration approval,, when present,, provides some much-needed validation. It is anticipated that these tools will continue to evolve and patient acceptance will continue to grow. Physician and care teams will need to familiarize themselves with the tools their patients are using and provide guidance and support for their use.

29036652#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#Atrial fibrillation detection in Reveal LINQ ICM uses patterns of incoherence in RR intervals and absence of P-wave evidence over a 2-min period. The enhanced algorithm includes P-wave evidence during RR irregularity as evidence of sinus arrhythmia or ectopy to adaptively optimize sensitivity for AF detection. The algorithm was developed and validated using Holter data from the XPECT and LINQ Usability studies which collected surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous ICM ECG over a 24-48?h period. The algorithm detections were compared with Holter annotations,, performed by multiple reviewers,, to compute episode and duration detection performance. The validation dataset comprised of 3187?h of valid Holter and LINQ recordings from 138 patients,, with true AF in 37 patients yielding 108 true AF episodes =2-min and 449?h of AF. The enhanced algorithm reduced inappropriately detected episodes by 49% and duration by 66% with <1% loss in true episodes or duration. The algorithm correctly identified 98.9% of total AF duration and 99.8% of total sinus or non-AF rhythm duration. The algorithm detected 97.2% (99.7% per-patient average) of all AF episodes =2-min,, and 84.9% (95.3% per-patient average) of detected episodes involved AF.
29036652#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#An enhancement that adapts sensitivity for AF detection reduced inappropriately detected episodes and duration with minimal reduction in sensitivity.

35657659#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health technologies enable allergists to monitor disease trends by collecting daily patient-reported outcomes of allergic rhinitis. To this end,, patients with allergies are usually required to enter their symptoms and medication repetitively over long time periods,, which may present a risk to data completeness and quality in the case of insufficient effort reporting. Completeness of patient's recording is easily measured. In contrast,, the intrinsic quality and accuracy of the data entered by the patients are more elusive.
35657659#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to explore the association of adherence to digital symptom recording with a predefined set of parameters of the patient-generated symptom and medication scores and to identify parameters that may serve as proxy measure of the quality and reliability of the information recorded by the patient.
35657659#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The @IT.2020 project investigates the diagnostic synergy of mobile health and molecular allergology in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In its pilot phase,, 101 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis were recruited in Rome and instructed to record their symptoms,, medication intake,, and general conditions daily via a mobile app (AllergyMonitor) during the relevant pollen season. We measured adherence to daily recording as the percentage of days with data recording in the observation period. We examined the patient's trajectories of 3 disease indices (Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score [RTSS],, Combined Symptom and Medication Score [CSMS],, and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) as putative proxies of data quality with the following 4 parameters: (1) intravariation index,, (2) percentage of zero values,, (3) coefficient of variation,, and (4) percentage of changes in trend. Lastly,, we examined the relationship between adherence to recording and each of the 4 proxy measures.
35657659#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Adherence to recording ranged from 20% (11/56) to 100% (56/56),, with 64.4% (65/101) and 35.6% (36/101) of the patients' values above (highly adherent patients) or below (low adherent patients) the threshold of 80%,, respectively. The percentage of zero values,, the coefficient of variation,, and the intravariation index did not significantly change with the adherence to recording. By contrast,, the proportion of changes in trend was significantly higher among highly adherent patients,, independently from the analyzed score (RTSS,, CSMS,, and VAS).

35657659#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The percentage of changes in the trend of RTSS,, CSMS,, and VAS is a valuable candidate to validate the quality and accuracy of the data recorded by patients with allergic rhinitis during the pollen season. The performance of this parameter must be further investigated in real-life conditions before it can be recommended for routine use in apps and electronic diaries devoted to the management of patients with allergic rhinitis.

18701414#ABSTRACT##Telepathology is useful when distance is an obstacle to timely diagnosis. Performance of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) at locations distant from cytopathologists can limit timely assessment of adequacy and preliminary diagnosis. We evaluated a telepathology system for consultation between residents and faculty for assessment of FNA specimen adequacy and preliminary diagnosis using 100 consecutive cases. We compared findings with the original assessment of adequacy,, preliminary interpretation,, and final diagnosis. Two residents initially screened 50 cases,, and images were then transmitted to cytopathologists,, who communicated by telephone. We found 97% diagnostic concordance and 99% accuracy. The screening time ranged from 41 seconds to 30:19 minutes (mean,, 6:35 minutes). The viewing time ranged from 10 seconds to 12:50 minutes (mean,, 3:52 minutes). Our telepathology system is efficient and accurate for the initial assessment and preliminary diagnosis of FNA specimens,, but we recommend its use by more senior and experienced trainees.

28267868#ABSTRACT##The accurate measurement of sport exposure time and injury occurrence is key to effective injury prevention and management. Current measures are limited by their inability to identify all types of sport-related injury,, narrow scope of injury information,, or lack the perspective of the injured athlete. The aims of the study were to evaluate the proportion of injuries and the agreement between sport exposures reported by the SMS messaging and follow-up telephone part of the SMS,, Phone,, and medical staff Examination (SPEx) sports injury surveillance system when compared to measures obtained by trained on-field observers and medical staff (comparison method). We followed 24 elite adolescent handball players over 12 consecutive weeks. Eighty-six injury registrations were obtained by the SPEx and comparison methods. Of them,, 35 injury registrations (41%) were captured by SPEx only,, 10 injury registrations (12%) by the comparison method only,, and 41 injury registrations (48%) by both methods. Weekly exposure time differences (95% limits of agreement) between SPEx and the comparison method ranged from -4.2 to 6.3 hours (training) and -1.5 to 1.0 hours (match) with systematic differences being 1.1 hours (95% CI 0.7 to 1.4) and -0.2 (95% CI -0.3 to -0.2),, respectively. These results support the ability of the SPEx system to measure training and match exposures and injury occurrence among young athletes. High weekly response proportions (mean 83%) indicate that SMS messaging can be used for player measures of injury consequences beyond time-loss from sport. However,, this needs to be further evaluated in large-scale studies.

35481559#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 4% of the world's population and is one of the major causes of stroke,, heart failure,, sudden death,, and cardiovascular morbidity. It can be difficult to diagnose when asymptomatic or in the paroxysmal stage,, and its natural history is not well understood. New wearables and connected devices offer an opportunity to improve on this situation.
35481559#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Eligible patients were recruited from 4 sites in Paris,, France. Electrocardiograms (12-lead reference and single lead) were captured simultaneously. The electrocardiograms were reviewed by independent,, blinded board-certified cardiologists. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm were calculated. The quality of single-lead electrocardiograms (visibility and polarity of waves,, interval durations,, heart rate) was assessed in comparison with the gold standard (12-lead electrocardiogram).
35481559#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 262 patients (atrial fibrillation: n=100,, age: mean 74.3 years,, SD 12.3; normal sinus rhythm: n=113,, age: 61.8 years,, SD 14.3; other arrhythmia: n=45,, 66.9 years,, SD 15.2; unreadable electrocardiograms: n=4) were included in the final analysis; 6.9% (18/262) were classified as Noise by the algorithm. Excluding other arrhythmias and Noise,, the sensitivity for atrial fibrillation detection was 0.963 (95% CI lower bound 0.894),, and the specificity was 1.000 (95% CI lower bound 0.967). Visibility and polarity accuracies were similar (1-lead electrocardiogram: P waves: 96.9%,, QRS complexes: 99.2%,, T waves: 91.2%; 12-lead electrocardiogram: P waves: 100%,, QRS complexes: 98.8%,, T waves: 99.5%). P-wave visibility accuracy was 99% (99/100) for patients with atrial fibrillation and 95.7% (155/162) for patients with normal sinus rhythm,, other arrhythmias,, and unreadable electrocardiograms. The absolute values of the mean differences in PR duration and QRS width were <3 ms,, and more than 97% were <40 ms. The mean difference between the heart rates from the 1-lead electrocardiogram calculated by the algorithm and those calculated by cardiologists was 0.55 bpm.
35481559#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The algorithm demonstrated great diagnostic performance for atrial fibrillation detection. The smartwatch's single-lead electrocardiogram also demonstrated good quality for physician use in daily routine care.
36044264#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#eHealth literacy is emerging as a crucial concept for promoting patient self-management in an overloaded hospital system. However,, to the best of our knowledge,, no tool currently exists to measure the level of eHealth literacy among French-speaking people. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is an easy-to-administer 8-item questionnaire (5-point Likert scale,, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree) that has already been translated into many languages. Currently,, it is the most cited questionnaire in the literature.
36044264#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to translate eHEALS to French and validate the French version of eHEALS (F-eHEALS).
36044264#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The validation of the F-eHEALS scale followed the 5 steps of the transcultural validation method: double reverse translation,, validation by a committee of experts (n=4),, pretest measurement to check the clarity of the items (n=22),, administration of the scale in French via a web-based quantitative study combined with two other questionnaires (Health Literacy Survey-Europe-16 and Patient Activation Measure-13; N=328 students),, and finally test-retest (n=78) to check the temporal stability of the measurements obtained from the scale.

36044264#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=6.416; P<.001) prove the validity and fidelity of the proposed scale. The internal consistency of F-eHEALS was estimated by Cronbach a of .89. The factor analysis with varimax rotation used to validate the construct showed a 2-factor scale. The effect of the construct was analyzed using 3 hypotheses related to the theory. The F-eHEALS score was correlated with the Health Literacy Survey-Europe-16 score (r=0.34; P<.001) and the Patient Activation Measure-13 score (r=0.31; P<.001).
36044264#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#F-eHEALS is consistent with the original version. It presents adequate levels of validity and fidelity. This 2D scale will need to be generalized to other populations in a French-speaking context. Finally,, a version taking into account collaborative applications (ie,, Health 2.0; eg,, Digital Health Literacy Instrument scale) should be considered on the basis of this study.

34713149#ABSTRACT##Digital proximity tracing (DPT) for Sars-CoV-2 pandemic mitigation is a complex intervention with the primary goal to notify app users about possible risk exposures to infected persons. DPT not only relies on the technical functioning of the proximity tracing application and its backend server,, but also on seamless integration of health system processes such as laboratory testing,, communication of results (and their validation),, generation of notification codes,, manual contact tracing,, and management of app-notified users. Policymakers and DPT operators need to know whether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance) and whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation (also in comparison to and beyond established mitigation measures,, particularly manual contact tracing). Thereby,, performance and effectiveness are not to be confused. Not only are there conceptual differences but also diverse data requirements. For example,, comparative effectiveness measures may require information generated outside the DPT system,, e.g.,, from manual contact tracing. This article describes differences between performance and effectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification system for DPT evaluation. We discuss key aspects for critical assessments of whether the integration of additional data measurements into DPT apps may facilitate understanding of performance and effectiveness of planned and deployed DPT apps. Therefore,, the terminology and a classification system may offer some guidance to DPT system operators regarding which measurements to prioritize. DPT developers and operators may also make conscious decisions to integrate measures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this introduces a secondary purpose to DPT. Ultimately,, the integration of further information (e.g.,, regarding exact exposure time) into DPT involves a trade-off between data granularity and linkage on the one hand,, and privacy on the other. More data may lead to better epidemiological information but may also increase the privacy risks associated with the system,, and thus decrease public DPT acceptance. Decision-makers should be aware of the trade-off and take it into account when planning and developing DPT systems or intending to assess the added value of DPT relative to the existing contact tracing systems.

30174018#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To examine if the tablet-based Agilis Health Mobile Audiogram (Agilis Audiogram) is an effective and valid measure of hearing thresholds compared to a pure-tone audiogram in an adult and pediatric population.
30174018#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants underwent an otologic exam,, conventional audiometric evaluation and the self-administered Agilis Audiogram. We examined whether the difference of pure-tone average (PTA) between the two measurement techniques fell within the equivalence range of ±8?dB. The Agilis Audiogram was administered twice for each subject to assess test-retest reliability of the application.

30174018#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 54 ears from 27 participants were evaluated. The average time to complete the self-administered Agilis Audiogram was 10?min. Among participants with normal hearing,, the average PTA from conventional audiometric evaluation was 8.9?dB (±3.8) and the average PTA from the Agilis Audiogram was 8.5?dB (±4.5),, with mean difference of 0.4?dB (±4.2; 95% CI -1.0 to 1.7?dB) falling within the equivalence range (-8 to 8?dB). Among participants with confirmed hearing loss,, the average PTA was 22.5?dB (±17.1) from conventional audiometric evaluation and 24.3?dB (±16.6) from the Agilis Audiogram,, with mean difference of -1.8?dB (±5.4; 95% CI -4.9 to 1.3?dB),, falling within the equivalence range. Overall,, there was a significant correlation between conventional audiometric evaluation and the Agilis Audiogram (Pearson correlation?=?0.93; p?<?0.001).
30174018#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Thresholds obtained by the Agilis Audiogram were found to be a valid measure of hearing among adults with normal hearing and children with hearing loss in the mild-moderate range.

35162470#ABSTRACT##Mobile health (mHealth) platforms have become increasingly popular for delivering health interventions in recent years and particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood obesity treatment is an area where mHealth interventions may be useful due to the multidisciplinary nature of interventions and the need for long-term care. Many mHealth apps targeting youth exist but the evidence base underpinning the methods for assessing technical usability,, user engagement and user satisfaction of such apps with target end-users or among clinical populations is unclear,, including for those aimed at paediatric overweight and obesity management. This review aims to examine the current literature and provide an overview of the scientific methods employed to test usability and engagement with mHealth apps in children and adolescents with obesity. A narrative literature review was undertaken following a systematic search. Four academic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were studies describing the usability of mHealth interventions for childhood obesity treatment. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria,, fifty-nine articles were included for full-text review,, and seven studies met the criteria for usability and engagement in a clinical paediatric population with obesity. Six apps were tested for usability and one for engagement in childhood obesity treatment. Sample sizes ranged from 6-1120 participants. The included studies reported several heterogenous measurement instruments,, data collection approaches,, and outcomes. Recommendations for future research include the standardization and validation of instruments to measure usability and engagement within mHealth studies in this population.

33665044#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic largely depends on scaling up the testing infrastructure for identifying infected individuals. Consumer-grade wearables may present a solution to detect the presence of infections in the population,, but the current paradigm requires collecting physiological data continuously and for long periods of time on each individual,, which poses limitations in the context of rapid screening. Technology: Here,, we propose a novel paradigm based on recording the physiological responses elicited by a short (~2 minutes) sequence of activities (i.e. "snapshot"),, to detect symptoms associated with COVID-19. We employed a novel body-conforming soft wearable sensor placed on the suprasternal notch to capture data on physical activity,, cardio-respiratory function,, and cough sounds.

33665044#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We performed a pilot study in a cohort of individuals (n=14) who tested positive for COVID-19 and detected altered heart rate,, respiration rate and heart rate variability,, relative to a group of healthy individuals (n=14) with no known exposure. Logistic regression classifiers were trained on individual and combined sets of physiological features (heartbeat and respiration dynamics,, walking cadence,, and cough frequency spectrum) at discriminating COVID-positive participants from the healthy group. Combining features yielded an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI=[0.92,, 0.96]) using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation scheme. Conclusions and Clinical Impact: These results,, although preliminary,, suggest that a sensor-based snapshot paradigm may be a promising approach for non-invasive and repeatable testing to alert individuals that need further screening.

36165480#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Several mobile health applications (MHAs) have been developed to assist and improve the quality of life of patients affected by premature ejaculation,, but the scientific quality and adherence to guidelines are not yet addressed.
36165480#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#On 25 May 2022,, we conducted a search in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We reviewed all mobile apps from Apple App Store and Google Play Store for premature ejaculation and evaluated their usage in screening,, prevention,, management,, and adherence to EAU guidelines.
36165480#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total 9 MHA were reviewed. All MHAs are geared towards the patient and provide information about diagnoses and treatment of PE. The mean score were 2.87,, 3.69,, 2.77,, 2.55,, 2.86 for Engagement,, Functionality,, Aesthetics,, Information,, and Subjective quality respectively. MHAs reported low and medium adherence to EAU guidelines.
36165480#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MHAs provide different services in many medical fields,, including male sexual dysfunction. Their development is constantly increasing,, but the problems of scientific validation,, content,, and quality are not yet solved. Much future research is necessary to improve the quality of the apps and promote new user designed,, and high-quality apps.

28326967#ABSTRACT#AIM#Environmental assessments and subsequent modifications conducted by healthcare professionals can enhance home safety and promote independent living. However,, travel time,, expense and the availability of qualified professionals can limit the broad application of this intervention. Remote technology has the potential to increase access to home safety evaluations.
28326967#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#This study describes the development and validation of a remote home safety protocol that can be used by a caregiver of an elderly person to video-record their home environment for later viewing and evaluation by a trained professional.
28326967#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The protocol was developed based on literature reviews and evaluations from clinical and content experts. Cognitive interviews were conducted with a group of six caregivers to validate the protocol.
28326967#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The final protocol included step-by-step directions to record indoor and outdoor areas of the home. The validation process resulted in modifications related to safety,, clarity of the protocol,, readability,, visual appearance,, technical descriptions and usability.

Implications for Rehabilitation The results of this study have several implications for rehabilitation practice The remote home safety evaluation protocol can potentially improve access to rehabilitation services for clients in remote areas and prevent unnecessary delays for needed care. Using our protocol,, a patient's caregiver can partner with therapists to quickly and efficiently evaluate a patient's home before they are released from the hospital. Caregiver narration,, which reflects a caregiver's own perspective,, is critical to evaluating home safety. In-home safety evaluations,, currently not available to all who need them due to access barriers,, can enhance a patient's independence and provide a safer home environment.
35386525#ABSTRACT##Therapeutic or serious games are considered innovative ways of delivering psychological interventions especially suited for children and adolescents,, which can have a positive impact on mental health,, while also being fun and easily accessible online. While most serious games for children and adolescents address specific issues,, such as anxiety or depression,, preventive measures received less attention. REThink is an online therapeutic game designed as a stand-alone prevention tool,, aiming to increase resilience in healthy children and adolescents in a Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy framework (David et al.,, 2019). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the validity of in-game performance measurements or scores as indicators of the game effectiveness in building real life emotion-regulation abilities. We analyzed how scores of different game levels (addressing different skills) are associated with improvements in mental health and emotion regulation abilities. Our preliminary results suggest that in-game performance at some levels (scores) consistently reflect improvements in psychological functioning,, while in-game performance at other levels are less associated with changes in real life self-reported psychological functioning. These results offer important information about which levels can be used as preliminary indicators of psychological improvements,, and which levels need to be revised in terms of task or scoring. Overall,, results of our study offer preliminary validation of REThink's game scoring system,, while also suggesting the elements to be refined.

35188469#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Human papillomavirus (HPV)-attributed cancers are preventable,, yet HPV vaccination rates severely lag behind other adolescent vaccinations. HPVcancerFree (HPVCF) is a mobile health (mHealth) intervention developed to influence parental HPV vaccination decision making by raising awareness of HPV,, reducing HPV vaccination barriers,, and enabling HPV vaccination scheduling and reminders through a smartphone app. Evaluating the user experience of mHealth interventions is a vital component in assessing their quality and success but tends to be underreported in mHealth intervention evaluation.
35188469#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to evaluate the user experience of HPVCF,, an HPV cancer prevention app designed for a pediatric clinic network,, using mixed methods data collected from log files,, survey measures,, and qualitative feedback.
35188469#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Study data were evaluated from parents in a large US pediatric clinic network using HPVCF in the treatment study condition of a group randomized controlled trial. Log data captured HPVCF retention and use. Postintervention rating scales and items assessed HPVCF utility,, usefulness,, understandability,, appeal,, credibility,, and perceived impact. Overall quality was evaluated using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMars). Open-ended responses assessed parent recommendations for HPVCF enhancement.
35188469#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The 98 parents were mainly female (n=94,, 96%),, 41 (5.67) years of age,, college educated (n=55,, 56%),, and White and non-Hispanic (n=55,, 56%) and had private health insurance for their children (n=75,, 77%). Parents used HPVCF 197 times,, with the average visit duration approximating 3.5 minutes. The uMARS app quality score was positively skewed (4.2/5.0). Mean ratings were highest for information (4.46 [SD 0.53]) and lowest for engagement (3.74 [SD 0.69]). In addition,, of 95 parents,, 45 (47%) rated HPVCF as helpful in HPV vaccination decision making and 16 (17%) attributed HPV vaccine initiation to HPVCF. Parents reported that HPVCF increased their awareness (84/95,, 88%),, knowledge (84/95,, 88%),, and HPV vaccination intentions (64/95,, 67%). Most of the 98 parents rated the 4 HPVCF components as useful (72-92 [73%-94%]). Parents also agreed that HPVCF is clear (86/95,, 91%),, accurate (86/95,, 91%),, and more helpful than other HPV vaccine information they had received (89/95,, 94%) and that they would recommend it to others (81/95,, 85%). In addition,, parents suggested ways to increase awareness and engagement with the app,, along with opportunities to enhance the content and functionality.
35188469#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#HPVCF was well received by parents and performed well on indicators of quality,, usefulness,, utility,, credibility,, and perceived impact. This study contributes a multimethod and multimeasure evaluation to the growing body of literature focused on assessing the user experience of patient-focused technology-mediated applications for HPV education.

33637645#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#Childhood blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is increasing as a result of improvements in neonatal care worldwide. We evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening in an Indian ROP telemedicine program and whether differences in ROP severity between neonatal care units (NCUs) identified by using AI are related to differences in oxygen-titrating capability.
33637645#ABSTRACT#METHODS#External validation study of an existing AI-based quantitative severity scale for ROP on a data set of images from the Retinopathy of Prematurity Eradication Save Our Sight ROP telemedicine program in India. All images were assigned an ROP severity score (1-9) by using the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity Deep Learning system. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity and specificity for treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Using multivariable linear regression,, we evaluated the mean and median ROP severity in each NCU as a function of mean birth weight,, gestational age,, and the presence of oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors.
33637645#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity was 0.98,, with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity. We found higher median (interquartile range) ROP severity in NCUs without oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors,, most apparent in bigger infants (>1500 g and 31 weeks' gestation: 2.7 [2.5-3.0] vs 3.1 [2.4-3.8]; P = .007,, with adjustment for birth weight and gestational age).
33637645#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Integration of AI into ROP screening programs may lead to improved access to care for secondary prevention of ROP and may facilitate assessment of disease epidemiology and NCU resources.

33189131#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Technological advances in healthcare have enabled patients to participate in digital self-assessment,, with reported benefits of enhanced healthcare efficiency and self-efficacy. This report describes the design and validation of a patient-administered preanaesthesia health assessment digital application for gathering medical history relevant to preanaesthesia assessment. Effective preoperative evaluation allows for timely optimization of medical conditions and reduces case cancellations on day of surgery.
33189131#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using an iterative mixed-methods approach of literature review,, surveys and panel consensus,, the study sought to develop and validate a digitized preanaesthesia health assessment questionnaire in terms of face and criterion validity. A total of 228 patients were enrolled at the preoperative evaluation clinic of a tertiary women's hospital. Inclusion criteria include: age  = 21?years,, scheduled for same-day-admission surgery,, literacy in English and willingness to use a digital device. Patient perception of the digitized application was also evaluated using the QQ10 questionnaire. Reliability of health assessment questionnaire was evaluated by comparing the percentage agreement of patient responses with nurse assessment.
33189131#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Moderate to good criterion validity was obtained in 81.1 and 83.8% of questions for the paper and digital questionnaires respectively. Of total 3626 response-pairs obtained,, there were 3405 (93.4%) concordant and 221 (6.1%) discrepant response-pairs for the digital questionnaire. Discrepant response-pairs,, such as ""no/yes" and "unsure/yes",, constitute only 3.7% of total response-pairs. Patient acceptability of the digitized assessment was high,, with QQ10 value and burden scores of 76 and 30%,, respectively.
33189131#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Self-administration of digitized preanaesthesia health assessment is acceptable to patients and reliable in eliciting medical history. Further iteration should focus on improving reliability of the digital tool,, adapting it for use in other languages and incorporating clinical decision tools.

15871741#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Association for Pathology Informatics (API) Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) TMA Data Exchange Specification (TMA DES) proposed in April 2003 provides a community-based,, open source tool for sharing tissue microarray (TMA) data in a common format. Each tissue core within an array has separate data including digital images; therefore an organized,, common approach to produce,, navigate and publish such data facilitates viewing,, sharing and merging TMA data from different laboratories. The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a HIV/AIDS tissue bank consortium sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). The ACSR offers HIV-related malignancies and uninfected control tissues in microarrays (TMA) accompanied by de-identified clinical data to approved researchers. Exporting our TMA data into the proposed API specified format offers an opportunity to evaluate the API specification in an applied setting and to explore its usefulness.
15871741#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A document type definition (DTD) that governs the allowed common data elements (CDE) in TMA DES export XML files was written,, tested and evolved and is in routine use by the ACSR. This DTD defines TMA DES CDEs which are implemented in an external file that can be supplemented by internal DTD extensions for locally defined TMA data elements (LDE).
15871741#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#ACSR implementation of the TMA DES demonstrated the utility of the specification and allowed application of a DTD to validate the language of the API specified XML elements and to identify possible enhancements within our TMA data management application. Improvements to the specification have additionally been suggested by our experience in importing other institution's exported TMA data. Enhancements to TMA DES to remove ambiguous situations and clarify the data should be considered. Better specified identifiers and hierarchical relationships will make automatic use of the data possible. Our tool can be used to reorder data and add identifiers; upgrading data for changes in the specification can be automatically accomplished. Using a DTD (optionally reflecting our proposed enhancements) can provide stronger validation of exported TMA data.

36951913#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Assessing a patient's suicide risk is challenging for health professionals because it depends on voluntary disclosure by the patient and often has limited resources. The application of novel machine learning approaches to determine suicide risk has clinical utility.
36951913#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches to assess suicidality based on acoustic voice features of psychiatric patients using artificial intelligence.
36951913#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We collected 348 voice recordings during clinical interviews of 104 patients diagnosed with mood disorders at baseline and 2,, 4,, 8,, and 12 months after recruitment. Suicidality was assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation and suicidal behavior using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The acoustic features of the voice,, including temporal,, formal,, and spectral features,, were extracted from the recordings. A between-person classification model that examines the vocal characteristics of individuals cross sectionally to detect individuals at high risk for suicide and a within-person classification model that detects considerable worsening of suicidality based on changes in acoustic features within an individual were developed and compared. Internal validation was performed using 10-fold cross validation of audio data from baseline to 2-month and external validation was performed using data from 2 to 4 months.
36951913#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A combined set of 12 acoustic features and 3 demographic variables (age,, sex,, and past suicide attempts) were included in the single-layer artificial neural network for the between-person classification model. Furthermore,, 13 acoustic features were included in the extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm for the within-person model. The between-person classifier was able to detect high suicidality with 69% accuracy (sensitivity 74%,, specificity 62%,, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.62),, whereas the within-person model was able to predict worsening suicidality over 2 months with 79% accuracy (sensitivity 68%,, specificity 84%,, area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.67). The second model showed 62% accuracy in predicting increased suicidality in external sets.
36951913#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Within-person analysis using changes in acoustic features within an individual is a promising approach to detect increased suicidality. Automated analysis of voice can be used to support the real-time assessment of suicide risk in primary care or telemedicine.

35775349#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Nowadays numerous mobile health applications (MHA) have been developed to assist and simplify the life of patients affected by erectile dysfunction (ED),, however the scientific quality and the adherence to guidelines are not yet addressed and solved.
35775349#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#On 17 January 2022,, we conducted a search in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.We reviewed all mobile apps from iTunes App Store and Google Play Store for ED and evaluated different aspects as well as their usage in screening,, prevention,, management,, and their adherence to EAU guidelines.
35775349#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 18 apps were reviewed. All apps are geared towards the patient and provide information about diagnoses and treatment of ED.
35775349#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MHA represent an integral part of patients' lives,, and apps providing services for male sexual dysfunction are constantly increasing. Despite this the overall quality is still low. Although many of these devices are useful in ED,, the problems of scientific validation,, content,, and quality are not yet solved. Further work is needed to improve the quality of apps and developing new accessible,, user designed,, and high-quality apps.

35187469#ABSTRACT##It is currently estimated that 67% of malaria deaths occur in children under-five years (WHO,, 2020). To improve the identification of children at clinical risk for malaria,, the WHO developed community (iCCM) and clinic-based (IMCI) protocols for frontline health workers using paper-based forms or digital mobile health (mHealth) platforms. To investigate improving the accuracy of these point-of-care clinical risk assessment protocols for malaria in febrile children,, we embedded a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) workflow into THINKMD's (IMCI) mHealth clinical risk assessment platform. This allowed us to perform a comparative analysis of THINKMD-generated malaria risk assessments with mRDT truth data to guide modification of THINKMD algorithms,, as well as develop new supervised machine learning (ML) malaria risk algorithms. We utilized paired clinical data and malaria risk assessments acquired from over 555 children presenting to five health clinics in Kano,, Nigeria to train ML algorithms to identify malaria cases using symptom and location data,, as well as confirmatory mRDT results. Supervised ML random forest algorithms were generated using 80% of our field-based data as the ML training set and 20% to test our new ML logic. New ML-based malaria algorithms showed an increased sensitivity and specificity of 60 and 79%,, and PPV and NPV of 76 and 65%,, respectively over THINKD initial IMCI-based algorithms. These results demonstrate that combining mRDT "truth" data with digital mHealth platform clinical assessments and clinical data can improve identification of children with malaria/non-malaria attributable febrile illnesses.

37354171#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The aim of this study was to independently validate the approach of using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify underlying paroxysmal AF from a 12-lead ECG in sinus rhythm (SR).
37354171#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An AI algorithm was trained to identify patients with underlying paroxysmal AF,, using electrocardiographic data from all in- and outpatients from a single center with at least 1 ECG in SR. For patients without AF,, all ECGs in SR were included. For patients with AF,, all ECGs in SR starting 31 days before the first AF event were included. The patients were randomly allocated to training,, internal validation,, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. In a secondary analysis,, the AF prevalence of the testing group was modified. Additionally,, the performance of the algorithm was validated at an external hospital.
37354171#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The dataset consisted of 494,,042 ECGs in SR from 142,,310 patients. Testing the model on the first ECG of each patient (AF prevalence 9.0%) resulted in accuracy of 78.1% (95% CI: 77.6%-78.5%),, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.87),, and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.48 (0.46-0.50). In a low-risk group (AF prevalence 3%),, the AUPRC decreased to 0.21 (95% CI: 0.18-0.24). In a high-risk group (AF prevalence 30%),, the AUPRC increased to 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78). This performance was robust when validated in an external hospital.

21937077#ABSTRACT##During the last decade,, whole slide images have been used in many areas of pathology such as teaching,, research,, digital archiving,, teleconsultation,, and quality assurance testing. However,, whole slide images have as yet not much been used for up-front diagnostics because of the lack of validation studies. The aim of this study was,, therefore,, to test the feasibility of whole slide images for diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract specimens,, one of the largest areas of diagnostic pathology. One hundred gastrointestinal tract biopsies and resections that had been diagnosed using light microscopy 1 year before were rediagnosed on whole slide images scanned at ×20 magnification by 5 pathologists (all reassessing their own cases),, having the original clinical information available but blinded to their original light microscopy diagnoses. The original light microscopy and whole slide image-based diagnoses were compared and classified as concordant,, slightly discordant (without clinical consequences),, and discordant. The diagnoses based on light microscopy and the whole slide image-based rediagnoses were concordant in 95% of the cases. Light microscopy and whole slide image diagnosis in the remaining 5% of cases were slightly discordant,, none of these were with clinical or prognostic implications. Up-front histopathologic diagnosis of gastrointestinal biopsies and resections can be done on whole slide images.

33136062#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#An aging population and increasing multimorbidity challenge health care systems worldwide. Patient segmentation aims to recognize groups of patients with similar needs,, offer targeted services to these groups,, and reduce the burden of health care. In this study,, the unique Finnish innovation Navigator,, a web-based service for patient segmentation,, is presented. Both patients and health care professionals complete the electronic questionnaire concerning patients' coping in everyday life and health state. Thus,, it considers the patient perspective on self-care. One of four customership-strategy (CS) groups (self-acting,, community,, cooperating,, and network) is then proposed in response to the answers given. This resulting strategy helps both professionals to coordinate patient health care and patients to utilize appropriate health services.
33136062#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to determine the feasibility,, validity,, and reliability of the Navigator service in the segmentation of patients with diabetes into four CS groups in a primary care setting. Patient characteristics concerning demographic status,, chronic conditions,, disabilities,, health-related quality of life,, and well-being in different CS groups will be described. We hypothesize that patients in the network group will be older,, have more illnesses,, chronic conditions or disabilities,, and require more health care services than patients in the self-acting group.
33136062#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this mixed methods study,, data collection was based on questionnaires (user experience of Navigator,, demographic and health status,, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0,, EuroQol 5D,, Wellbeing Questionnaire 12,, and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire) issued to 300 patients with diabetes and on user-experience questionnaires for and semistructured focus-group interviews with 12 nurses. Navigator-database reports and diabetes-care values (blood pressure,, BMI,, HbA1c,, low-density lipoprotein,, albumin-creatinine,, smoking status) were collected. Qualitative and descriptive analyses were used to study the feasibility,, content,, concurrent,, and face validity of Navigator. While criterion and concurrent validity were examined with correlations,, reliability was examined by calculating Cohen kappa and Cronbach alpha. Construct validity is studied by performing exploratory-factor analysis on Navigator data reports and by hypothesis testing. The values,, demographics,, and health status of patients in different groups were described,, and differences between groups were studied by comparing means. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess which variables affect CS group variation.
33136062#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Data collection was completed in September 2019,, and the first feasibility results are expected by the end of 2020. Further results and publications are expected in 2021 and 2022.

The study will examine the segregation of patients with diabetes into four CS groups in a primary care setting and the differences between patients in groups. This study will assist in Navigator's further development as a patient segmentation method considering patients' perspectives on self-care. This study will not prove the effectiveness or efficacy of Navigator; therefore,, it is essential to study these outcomes of separate care pathways.

36736890#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To examine the classification rates and screening properties,, including sensitivity and specificity,, of the web-based Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddler,, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F) compared with paper-phone administration,, and to determine the extent to which electronic M-CHAT-R/F streamlines screening,, increases screening fidelity,, increases diagnostic evaluation participation,, and decreases waiting time from screening to evaluation compared with paper-phone modality.
36736890#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#Primary-care practices in urban and suburban settings administered either the web-based or paper-phone M-CHAT-R/F using a prospective nonrandomized control design. Toddlers (n=17,,900) were screened between 2009 and 2016 at routine well-child check-ups. Toddlers who screened at risk on the M-CHAT-R/F were invited to complete diagnostic evaluations; 176 children were diagnosed with autism. Chi-square,, Fisher's exact,, and t-tests,, as well as regression and screening properties were used to compare outcome distributions,, screening properties,, and implementation by modality.
36736890#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Classification rates of the initial M-CHAT-R into low,, medium,, and high risk were significantly different across modalities with very small effect sizes. Sensitivity and specificity were high across both modalities. For children in the medium-risk range,, the web-based modality had a higher rate of predicting risk for autism after Follow-Up compared with the paper-phone modality,, and the web eliminated delay between initial screen and Follow-Up. The web-based modality showed increased screening fidelity,, no data loss,, and similar rates of evaluation attendance and time to evaluation from Follow-Up administration.

15969790#ABSTRACT##Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of vision loss in industrialized countries. Diabetic retinopathy has features which make it ideal for disease management by telemedicine. The American Telemedicine Association (ATA) has recently established consensus recommendations for ocular telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy,, in cooperation with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. The guiding principle is that it would be inappropriate to use telemedicine to provide anything less than the accepted standard of clinical care. The ATA practice recommendations delineate performance standards for the clinical,, technical and administrative elements of ocular telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy. Four clinical categories of assessment were identified. Category 4 validation,, for example,, indicates that a system matches or exceeds the ability of current photographs to identify lesions of diabetic retinopathy. To create the practice recommendations,, workshops were held to address each of the three components: (1) clinical,, (2) technical,, and (3) operational and business. Ocular telemedicine programmes will need to demonstrate sustainability and cost-effectiveness,, and respect a patient's right to privacy. Nevertheless,, ocular telemedicine seems poised to become an integral part of eye health care,, as long as programmes meet or exceed present clinical standards of care,, and patient and provider expectations are clearly defined.

23920536#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Screening guidelines for diabetic patients recommend yearly eye examinations to detect diabetic retinopathy and other forms of diabetic eye disease. However,, annual screening rates for retinopathy in US urban safety net settings remain low.
23920536#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using data gathered from a study of teleretinal screening in six urban safety net clinics,, we assessed whether predictive modeling could be of value in identifying patients at risk of developing retinopathy. We developed and examined the accuracy of two predictive modeling approaches for diabetic retinopathy in a sample of 513 diabetic individuals,, using routinely available clinical variables from retrospective medical record reviews. Bayesian networks and radial basis function (neural) networks were learned using ten-fold cross-validation.
23920536#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The predictive models were modestly predictive with the best model having an AUC of 0.71.
23920536#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Using routinely available clinical variables to predict patients at risk of developing retinopathy and to target them for annual eye screenings may be of some usefulness to safety net clinics.

36904954#ABSTRACT##Determining the presence and severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a valuable application of inertial measurement units (IMUs) in the remote monitoring of patients. This study aimed to employ the Fourier representation of IMU signals to differentiate between individuals with and without knee OA. We included 27 patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis (15 females) and 18 healthy controls (11 females). Gait acceleration signals were recorded during overground walking. We obtained the frequency features of the signals using the Fourier transform. The logistic LASSO regression was employed on the frequency domain features as well as the participant's age,, sex,, and BMI to distinguish between the acceleration data from individuals with and without knee OA. The model's accuracy was estimated by 10-fold cross-validation. The frequency contents of the signals were different between the two groups. The average accuracy of the classification model using the frequency features was 0.91 ± 0.01. The distribution of the selected features in the final model differed between patients with different severity of knee OA. In this study,, we demonstrated that using logistic LASSO regression on the Fourier representation of acceleration signals can accurately determine the presence of knee OA.

20854068#ABSTRACT##There has been a recent upsurge in worldwide attention on digital pathology,, which has transformed from static snapshots from camera-equipped microscopes to its modern form that encompasses scanning of whole glass slides with evaluation of histological images on a computer screen,, along with management of its accompanying information. Although it has been widely accepted in education and research,, its implementation in diagnostic surgical pathology practice is not without challenges in workflow integration,, technological infrastructure,, pathologist acclimatisation,, global standardisation for clinical practice,, and cost issues,, among others. Nonetheless,, early adopters have harnessed its benefits in specific niches,, like frozen section services and remote second opinion consultations. Its tremendous potential is worthy of further validation to compare with conventional glass slide evaluation,, even while it is already paving the way for advancement into virtual three-dimensional imaging technology,, with a glimpse into a possible future digital diagnostic pathology practice.

36077668#ABSTRACT##Traditional cancer registries have often been siloed efforts,, established by single groups with limited objectives. There is the potential for registry data to support a broad range of research,, audit and education initiatives. Here,, we describe the establishment of a series of comprehensive cancer registries across the spectrum of common solid cancers. The experience and learnings of each registry team as they develop,, implement and then use collected data for a range of purposes,, that informs the conduct and output of other registries in a virtuous cycle. Each registry is multi-site,, multi-disciplinary and aims to collect data of maximal interest and value to a broad range of enquiry,, which would be accessible to any researcher with a high-quality proposal. Lessons learnt include the need for careful and continuous curation of data fields,, with regular database updates,, and the need for a continued focus on data quality. The registry data as a standalone resource has supported numerous projects,, but linkage with external datasets with patients in common has enhanced the audit and research potential. Multiple projects have linked registry data with matched tissue specimens to support prognostic and predictive biomarker studies,, both validation and discovery. Registry-based biomarker trials have been successfully supported,, generating novel and practice-changing data. Registry-based clinical trials,, particularly randomised studies exploring the optimal use of available therapy options are now complementing the research conducted in traditional clinical trials. More recent projects supported by the registries include health economic studies,, personalised patient education material,, and increased consumer engagement,, including consumer entered data.

37316858#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) can be readily calculated from real-world data collected with wearable devices and ad-hoc algorithms,, technical validation is still required. The aim of this paper is to comparatively assess and validate DMOs estimated using real-world gait data from six different cohorts,, focusing on gait sequence detection,, foot initial contact detection (ICD),, cadence (CAD) and stride length (SL) estimates.
37316858#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Overall,, the identified algorithms enabled a robust estimation of key DMOs. Our findings showed that the choice of algorithm for estimation of gait sequence detection and CAD should be cohort-specific (e.g.,, slow walkers and with gait impairments). Short walking bout length and slow walking speed worsened algorithms' performances. Trial registration ISRCTN - 12246987.

37316858#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Twenty healthy older adults,, 20 people with Parkinson's disease,, 20 with multiple sclerosis,, 19 with proximal femoral fracture,, 17 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 12 with congestive heart failure were monitored for 2.5 h in the real-world,, using a single wearable device worn on the lower back. A reference system combining inertial modules with distance sensors and pressure insoles was used for comparison of DMOs from the single wearable device. We assessed and validated three algorithms for gait sequence detection,, four for ICD,, three for CAD and four for SL by concurrently comparing their performances (e.g.,, accuracy,, specificity,, sensitivity,, absolute and relative errors). Additionally,, the effects of walking bout (WB) speed and duration on algorithm performance were investigated.
37316858#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified two cohort-specific top performing algorithms for gait sequence detection and CAD,, and a single best for ICD and SL. Best gait sequence detection algorithms showed good performances (sensitivity?>?0.73,, positive predictive values?>?0.75,, specificity?>?0.95,, accuracy?>?0.94). ICD and CAD algorithms presented excellent results,, with sensitivity?>?0.79,, positive predictive values?>?0.89 and relative errors?<?11% for ICD and?<?8.5% for CAD. The best identified SL algorithm showed lower performances than other DMOs (absolute error?<?0.21 m). Lower performances across all DMOs were found for the cohort with most severe gait impairments (proximal femoral fracture). Algorithms' performances were lower for short walking bouts; slower gait speeds (<?0.5 m/s) resulted in reduced performance of the CAD and SL algorithms.

32840673#ABSTRACT##Digital pathology with whole-slide imaging (WSI) has a large potential to make the process of expert consultation and expert panel diagnosis more rapid and more efficient. However,, comparison with the current methods is necessary for validation of the technique. In this study,, we determined if digital assessment of whole-slide images of hematopathology specimens with a focus on the assessment of lymphoma can be used for consultation and panel diagnostics. Ninety-three histological specimens with a suspicion for lymphoma were assessed both with conventional microscopy and digital microscopy with a wash out period between assessments. A consensus diagnosis was based on full concordance between the pathologists or,, in case of discordances,, was reached at a joint session at a multi-headed microscope. In 81% of the cases,, there was a full concordance between digital and light microscopical assessment for all three pathologists. Discordances between conventional microscopy and digital pathology were present in 3% of assessments. In comparison with the consensus diagnosis,, discordant diagnoses were made in 5 cases with digital microscopy and in 3 cases with light microscopy. The reported level of confidence and need for additional investigations were similar between assessment by conventional and by digital microscopy. In conclusion,, the performance of assessment by digital pathology is in general comparable with that of conventional light microscopy and pathologists feel confident using digital pathology for this subspecialty.

35776504#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two of the most prevalent chronic conditions worldwide. An unhealthy lifestyle greatly contributes to someone's risk of developing these conditions. Mobile health is an emerging technology that can help deliver health promotion interventions to the population,, for example,, in the form of health apps.
35776504#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of an app-based intervention for cardiovascular and diabetes risk awareness and prevention by measuring nonusage,, dropout,, adherence to app use,, and usability of the app over 3 months.

35776504#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Recruitment took place between September and October 2021. Of the 46 participants who consented to the study,, 20 (44%) never used the app and 15 (33%) dropped out. The median age of the app users at baseline was 62 (IQR 56-67) years. Adherence to app use,, that is,, using the app at least once a week over 3 months,, was 17% (8/46) of the total sample and 31% (8/26) of all app users. The mean app quality rating on the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale was 3.5 (SD 0.6) of 5 points. The app scored the highest for the information section and the lowest for the engagement section of the scale.
35776504#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Nonusage and dropouts were too high,, and the adherence was too low to consider the intervention in its current form feasible. Potential barriers that we identified include the research team not actively engaging with participants early in the study to verify that all participants could install the app,, the intervention did not involve direct contact with health care professionals,, and the app did not have enough interactive features.

35124665#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) consumer applications (apps) have been integrated with deep learning for skin cancer risk assessments. However,, prospective validation of these apps is lacking.
35124665#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To identify the diagnostic accuracy of an app integrated with a convolutional neural network for the detection of premalignant and malignant skin lesions.
35124665#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed a prospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study of a CE-marked mHealth app from January 1 until August 31,, 2020,, among adult patients with at least one suspicious skin lesion. Skin lesions were assessed by the app on an iOS or Android device after clinical diagnosis and before obtaining histopathology. The app outcome was compared to the histopathological diagnosis,, or if not available,, the clinical diagnosis by a dermatologist. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of the app to detect premalignant and malignant skin lesions. Subgroup analyses were conducted for different smartphone types,, the lesion's origin,, indication for dermatological consultation,, and lesion location.

35124665#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 785 lesions,, including 418 suspicious and 367 benign control lesions,, among 372 patients (50.8% women) with a median age of 71 years were included. The app performed at an overall 86.9% (95% CI 82.3-90.7) sensitivity and 70.4% (95% CI 66.2-74.3) specificity. The sensitivity was significantly higher on the iOS device compared to the Android device (91.0 vs. 83.0%; p = 0.02). Specificity calculated on benign control lesions was significantly higher than suspicious skin lesions (80.1 vs. 45.5%; p < 0.001). Sensitivity was higher in skin fold areas compared to smooth skin areas (92.9 vs. 84.2%; p = 0.01),, while the specificity was higher for lesions in smooth skin areas (72.0 vs. 56.6%; p = 0.02).
35124665#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The diagnostic accuracy of the mHealth app is far from perfect,, but is potentially promising to empower patients to self-assess skin lesions before consulting a health care professional. An additional prospective validation study,, particularly for suspicious pigmented skin lesions,, is warranted. Furthermore,, studies investigating mHealth implementation in the lay population are needed to demonstrate the impact on health care systems.

36201476#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The development of optimal strategies to treat impaired mobility related to ageing and chronic disease requires better ways to detect and measure it. Digital health technology,, including body worn sensors,, has the potential to directly and accurately capture real-world mobility. Mobilise-D consists of 34 partners from 13 countries who are working together to jointly develop and implement a digital mobility assessment solution to demonstrate that real-world digital mobility outcomes have the potential to provide a better,, safer,, and quicker way to assess,, monitor,, and predict the efficacy of new interventions on impaired mobility. The overarching objective of the study is to establish the clinical validity of digital outcomes in patient populations impacted by mobility challenges,, and to support engagement with regulatory and health technology agencies towards acceptance of digital mobility assessment in regulatory and health technology assessment decisions.
36201476#ABSTRACT#METHODS/DESIGN#The Mobilise-D clinical validation study is a longitudinal observational cohort study that will recruit 2400 participants from four clinical cohorts. The populations of the Innovative Medicine Initiative-Joint Undertaking represent neurodegenerative conditions (Parkinson's Disease),, respiratory disease (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),, neuro-inflammatory disorder (Multiple Sclerosis),, fall-related injuries,, osteoporosis,, sarcopenia,, and frailty (Proximal Femoral Fracture). In total,, 17 clinical sites in ten countries will recruit participants who will be evaluated every six months over a period of two years. A wide range of core and cohort specific outcome measures will be collected,, spanning patient-reported,, observer-reported,, and clinician-reported outcomes as well as performance-based outcomes (physical measures and cognitive/mental measures). Daily-living mobility and physical capacity will be assessed directly using a wearable device. These four clinical cohorts were chosen to obtain generalizable clinical findings,, including diverse clinical,, cultural,, geographical,, and age representation. The disease cohorts include a broad and heterogeneous range of subject characteristics with varying chronic care needs,, and represent different trajectories of mobility disability.
36201476#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The results of Mobilise-D will provide longitudinal data on the use of digital mobility outcomes to identify,, stratify,, and monitor disability. This will support the development of widespread,, cost-effective access to optimal clinical mobility management through personalised healthcare. Further,, Mobilise-D will provide evidence-based,, direct measures which can be endorsed by regulatory agencies and health technology assessment bodies to quantify the impact of disease-modifying interventions on mobility.

36910572#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Traditional methods for obtaining outcomes for patients after acute stroke are resource-intensive. This study aimed to examine the feasibility,, reliability,, cost,, and acceptability of collecting outcomes after acute stroke with a short message service (SMS)-text messaging program.
36910572#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients were enrolled in an SMS-text messaging program at acute stroke hospitalization discharge. Participants were prompted to complete assessments including the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement (PROM) Information System Global-10 at 30,, 60,, and 90 days postdischarge via SMS-text. Agreement and cost of SMS-text data collection were compared to those obtained from traditional follow-up methods (via phone or in the clinic). Participant satisfaction was surveyed upon program conclusion.
36910572#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# ?=?0.4,, p?<?0.01). A cost equation showed that gathering outcomes via SMS texting would be less costly than phone follow-up for cohorts with more than 181 patients. Nearly all participants (91%) found the program acceptable and not burdensome (94%),, and most (53%) felt it was helpful. Poststroke outcome data collection via SMS texting is feasible,, reliable,, low-cost,, and acceptable. Reliability was higher for functional outcomes as compared to PROMs.
36910572#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#While further validation is required,, our findings suggest that SMS texting is a feasible method for gathering outcomes after stroke at scale to evaluate the efficacy of acute stroke treatments.

25393698#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Several studies have revealed the need for development of communication competence in telenursing. Structured analyses of conversations with patients/callers,, is one way to increase telenurses' awareness of their unique communication and interpersonal competence.
25393698#ABSTRACT#METHOD#The process to determine content validity was done in two stages; the development stage and the assessment stage. The development stage started with a literature search. The assessment stage was separated into two phases,, assessment by an expert group and assessment and test by telenurses. The telenurses also participated in consensus discussions.
25393698#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study describes the thorough development process of the telenursing self-assessment tool to be used by telenurses in order to become aware of their unique communication and interpersonal competence when analysing their own conversations with patients/callers. As a formative tool it is meant to provide self-direction,, feedback and coaching,, and create learning opportunities.
25393698#ABSTRACT#RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE#The self-assessment tool helps the telenurse to follow the nursing process,, to be patient-centred,, and it is meant to provide self-direction,, feedback,, and coaching,, as well as create learning opportunities. The tool can contribute to the development of communication and interpersonal competence in telephone advice nursing. Further development of the tool may provide an objective scoring instrument for evaluating communication training and education in the field.

32047860#ABSTRACT##Fueled by advances in technology,, increased access to smartphones,, and capital investment,, the number of available health "apps" has exploded in recent years. Patients use their smartphones for many things,, but not as much as they might for health,, especially for managing their chronic conditions. Moreover,, while significant work is ongoing to develop,, validate,, and evaluate these apps,, it is less clear how to effectively disseminate apps into routine clinical practice. We propose a framework for prescribing apps and outline the key issues that need to be addressed to enable app dissemination in clinical care. This includes: education and awareness,, creating digital formularies,, workflow and EHR integration,, payment models,, and patient/provider support. As work in digital health continues to expand,, integrating health apps into clinical care delivery will be critical if digital health is to achieve its potential.

19382868#ABSTRACT##Thermal imaging of the skin has been used for several decades for monitoring of temperature distribution of human skin for the detection of thermal abnormalities indicating pathologies (malignancies,, inflammation,, infection,, and vascular,, dermatological,, and rheumatic disorders). Literature has shown that to detect and monitor the thermal abnormalities related to pathologic conditions,, there is a need to extend acquisition over 8,, 12,, 16,, or 24 hours. A wearable device is strongly needed in contact thermography to reach the objective of long-term monitoring of contact thermography,, especially in telemedicine applications. A wearable system has been designed and constructed that allows the continuous thermographic monitoring of a skin region at the point of affixation. Measurement allowed by this system is direct and not hampered by the influence of the environment--as with IR thermography--nor by the geometry of skin surface (curvatures,, roughness) thanks to the flexible adaptation of the sensing head to the surface. The validation of the system embedded in a pilot preliminary telemedicine application was successful. The next step will be the wide focusing and adaptation to telemedicine clinical applications to assess the response to the chemotherapy and tune the therapy at home of the breast cancer or the response to the inflammation care.

36104666#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 17 studies meeting eligibility criteria were included in the analysis,, from which about 70% of the studies have prognostic level I (n?=?8) and level II (n?=?4) evidence. The review found that various guidelines are recommending different algorithms for CVD risk prediction. The QRISK® was the most accurate CVD risk calculator for several study populations,, whereas World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) risk scores were the least accurate. The key features of CVD risk calculators are variables,, predictive accuracy,, discrimination index,, applicability,, understandability,, and cost-effectiveness.
36104666#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#For the selected risk prediction tool,, development and validation research must be done,, which considers a mix of stroke-specific risk and CVD risk to establish its usability in the local community and advantages to the particular health-care environment. To get healthcare professionals more involved in preventing and treating CVDs,, each healthcare setting should use an online CVD risk assessment tool that is more useful,, accurate,, and easy to use,, based on the population and health system.

15668886#ABSTRACT##This paper describes the design and fabrication of a novel array microscope for the first ultrarapid virtual slide processor (DMetrix DX-40 digital slide scanner). The array microscope optics consists of a stack of three 80-element 10 x 8-lenslet arrays,, constituting a "lenslet array ensemble." The lenslet array ensemble is positioned over a glass slide. Uniquely shaped lenses in each of the lenslet arrays,, arranged perpendicular to the glass slide constitute a single "miniaturized microscope." A high-pixel-density image sensor is attached to the top of the lenslet array ensemble. In operation,, the lenslet array ensemble is transported by a motorized mechanism relative to the long axis of a glass slide. Each of the 80 miniaturized microscopes has a lateral field of view of 250 microns. The microscopes of each row of the array are offset from the microscopes in other rows. Scanning a glass slide with the array microscope produces seamless two-dimensional image data of the entire slide,, that is,, a virtual slide. The optical system has a numerical aperture of N.A.= 0.65,, scans slides at a rate of 3 mm per second,, and accrues up to 3,,000 images per second from each of the 80 miniaturized microscopes. In the ultrarapid virtual slide processing cycle,, the time for image acquisition takes 58 seconds for a 2.25 cm2 tissue section. An automatic slide loader enables the scanner to process up to 40 slides per hour without operator intervention. Slide scanning and image processing are done concurrently so that post-scan processing is eliminated. A virtual slide can be viewed over the Internet immediately after the scanning is complete. A validation study compared the diagnostic accuracy of pathologist case readers using array microscopy (with images viewed as virtual slides) and conventional light microscopy. Four senior pathologists diagnosed 30 breast surgical pathology cases each using both imaging modes,, but on separate occasions. Of 120 case reads by array microscopy,, there were 3 incorrect diagnoses,, all of which were made on difficult cases with equivocal diagnoses by light microscopy. There was a strong correlation between array microscopy vs. "truth" diagnoses based on surgical pathology reports. The kappa statistic for the array microscopy vs. truth was 0.96,, which is highly significant (z=10.33,, p <0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between rates of agreement with truth between array microscopy and light microscopy (z=0.134,, p >0.05). Array microscopy and light microscopy did not differ significantly with respect to the number/percent of correct decisions rendered (t=0.552,, p=0.6376) or equivocal decisions rendered (t=2.449,, p=0.0917). Pathologists rated 95.8% of array microscopy virtual slide images as good or excellent. None were rated as poor. The mean viewing time for a DMetrix virtual slide was 1.16 minutes. The DMetrix virtual slide processor has been found to reduce the virtual slide processing cycle more than 10 fold,, as compared with other virtual slide systems reported to date. The virtual slide images are of high quality and suitable for diagnostic pathology,, second opinions,, expert opinions,, clinical trials,, education,, and research.

36807680#ABSTRACT##There are concerns about the validation and accuracy of currently available consumer sleep technology for sleep-disordered breathing. The present report provides a background review of existing consumer sleep technologies and discloses the methods and procedures for a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy of these devices and apps for the detection of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring in comparison with polysomnography. The search will be performed in four databases (PubMed,, Scopus,, Web of Science,, and the Cochrane Library). Studies will be selected in two steps,, first by an analysis of abstracts followed by full-text analysis,, and two independent reviewers will perform both phases. Primary outcomes include apnea-hypopnea index,, respiratory disturbance index,, respiratory event index,, oxygen desaturation index,, and snoring duration for both index and reference tests,, as well as the number of true positives,, false positives,, true negatives,, and false negatives for each threshold,, as well as for epoch-by-epoch and event-by-event results,, which will be considered for the calculation of surrogate measures (including sensitivity,, specificity,, and accuracy). Diagnostic test accuracy meta-analyses will be performed using the Chu and Cole bivariate binomial model. Mean difference meta-analysis will be performed for continuous outcomes using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. Analyses will be performed independently for each outcome. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will evaluate the effects of the types (wearables,, nearables,, bed sensors,, smartphone applications),, technologies (e.g.,, oximeter,, microphone,, arterial tonometry,, accelerometer),, the role of manufacturers,, and the representativeness of the samples.

25627857#ABSTRACT##Telemedicine projects are aimed at offering medical services to people who do not have access to direct diagnosis and treatment services. As a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of complex systems and taking probable events into consideration,, systemic simulation can facilitate the analysis of implementation processes of telemedicine projects in real-life-like situations. The aim of the present study was to propose a model for planning resource capacities and allocating human and operational resources to promote the efficiency of telemedicine project by investigating the process of teleradiology. In this article,, after verification of the conceptual model by the experts of this field,, the computerized simulation model is developed using simulation software Arena. After specifying the required data,, different improvement scenarios are run using the computerized model by feeding the data into the software and validation and verification of the model. Fixing input data of the system such as the number of patients,, their waiting time,, and process time of each function,, for example,, magnetic resonance imaging or scan,, has been compared with the current radiology process. Implementing the teleradiology model resulted in reduction of time of patients in the system (current: 1.84 ± 0.00,, tele: 0.81 ± 0.00). Furthermore,, through this process,, they can allocate the lower resources to perform better functions of staff. The use of computerized simulation is essential for designing processes,, optimal allocation of resources,, planning,, and making appropriate decisions for providing timely services to patients.
29494361#ABSTRACT##This study explored the use of unsupervised machine learning to identify subgroups of patients with heart failure who used telehealth services in the home health setting,, and examined intercluster differences for patient characteristics related to medical history,, symptoms,, medications,, psychosocial assessments,, and healthcare utilization. Using a feature selection algorithm,, we selected seven variables from 557 patients for clustering. We tested three clustering techniques: hierarchical,, k-means,, and partitioning around medoids. Hierarchical clustering was identified as the best technique using internal validation methods. Intercluster differences among patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed with either ? test or one-way analysis of variance. Ranging in size from 153 to 233 patients,, three clusters displayed patterns that differed significantly (P < .05) in patient characteristics of age,, sex,, medical history of comorbid conditions,, use of beta blockers,, and quality of life assessment. Significant (P < .001) intercluster differences in number of medications,, comorbidities,, and healthcare utilization were also revealed. The study identified patterns of association between (1) mental health status,, pulmonary disorders,, and obesity,, and (2) healthcare utilization for patients with heart failure who used telehealth in the home health setting. Study results also revealed a lack of prescription guideline-recommended heart failure medications for the subgroup with the highest proportion of older female adults.

36850433#ABSTRACT##In response to rapid population ageing,, digital technology represents the greatest resource in supporting the implementation of active and healthy ageing principles at clinical and service levels. However,, digital information platforms that deliver coordinated health and social care services for older people to cover their needs comprehensively and adequately are still not widespread. The present work is part of a project that focuses on creating a new personalised healthcare and social assistance model to enhance older people's quality of life. This model aims to prevent acute events to favour the elderly staying healthy in their own home while reducing hospitalisations. In this context,, the prompt identification of criticalities and vulnerabilities through ICT devices and services is crucial. According to the human-centred care vision,, this paper proposes a decision-support algorithm for the automatic and patient-specific assignment of tailored sets of devices and local services based on adults' health and social needs. This decision-support tool,, which uses a tree-like model,, contains conditional control statements. Using sequences of binary divisions drives the assignation of products and services to each user. Based on many predictive factors of frailty,, the algorithm aims to be efficient and time-effective. This goal is achieved by adequately combining specific features,, thresholds,, and constraints related to the ICT devices and patients' characteristics. The validation was carried out on 50 participants. To test the algorithm,, its output was compared to clinicians' decisions during the multidimensional evaluation. The algorithm reported a high sensitivity (96% for fall monitoring and 93% for cardiac tracking) and a lower specificity (60% for fall monitoring and 27% for cardiac monitoring). Results highlight the preventive and protective behaviour of the algorithm.

29077532#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#As Internet bandwidth has risen,, resulting in an exponential increase in the amount of data,, one of the challenges is to transform large amounts of unstructured health data into legible information through visualization techniques to facilitate the decision-making between the telehealth managers. Traditionally,, data visualization has been two-dimensional (2D),, but it is often difficult to visualize and interpret when making decisions with multidimensional data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization techniques are emerging to address this issue. This study aims to investigate and demonstrate the hypothesis that the use of 3D techniques for information visualization is more effective than some 2D visualization techniques. Hypothesis validation was performed with a usability methodology analyzing of the time,, efficiency,, effectiveness,, and mental workload required in the execution of a task with a developed prototype.
29077532#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The study showed that mental workload,, despite the time of task execution and effectiveness of the prototype,, with 3D technique was less than the 2D technique. The 3D technique required less mental effort than the 2D technique.
29077532#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The 3D environment supports the service manager to verify the telehealth quality of service toward the features provided by 3D environment,, especially,, its capability to identify trends,, clusters of interest,, and perform indicators comparison.

30339669#ABSTRACT##It is not fully clear which measurable factors can reliably predict chronic stroke patients' recovery of motor ability. In this analysis,, we investigate the impact of patient demographic characteristics,, movement features,, and a three-week upper-extremity intervention on the post-treatment change in two widely used clinical outcomes-the Upper Extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer and the Wolf Motor Function Test. Models based on LASSO,, which in validation tests account for 65% and 86% of the variability in Fugl-Meyer and Wolf,, respectively,, were used to identify the set of salient demographic and movement features. We found that age,, affected limb,, and several measures describing the patient's ability to efficiently direct motions with a single burst of speed were the most consequential in predicting clinical recovery. On the other hand,, the upper-extremity intervention was not a significant predictor of recovery. Beyond a simple prognostic tool,, these results suggest that focusing therapy on the more important features is likely to improve recovery. Such validation-intensive methods are a novel approach to determining the relative importance of patient-specific metrics and may help guide the design of customized therapy.

28263938#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The current ability to predict readmissions in patients with heart failure is modest at best. It is unclear whether machine learning techniques that address higher dimensional,, nonlinear relationships among variables would enhance prediction. We sought to compare the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for predicting readmissions.
28263938#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#Using data from the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes trial,, we compared the effectiveness of random forests,, boosting,, random forests combined hierarchically with support vector machines or logistic regression (LR),, and Poisson regression against traditional LR to predict 30- and 180-day all-cause readmissions and readmissions because of heart failure. We randomly selected 50% of patients for a derivation set,, and a validation set comprised the remaining patients,, validated using 100 bootstrapped iterations. We compared C statistics for discrimination and distributions of observed outcomes in risk deciles for predictive range. In 30-day all-cause readmission prediction,, the best performing machine learning model,, random forests,, provided a 17.8% improvement over LR (mean C statistics,, 0.628 and 0.533,, respectively). For readmissions because of heart failure,, boosting improved the C statistic by 24.9% over LR (mean C statistic 0.678 and 0.543,, respectively). For 30-day all-cause readmission,, the observed readmission rates in the lowest and highest deciles of predicted risk with random forests (7.8% and 26.2%,, respectively) showed a much wider separation than LR (14.2% and 16.4%,, respectively).
28263938#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Machine learning methods improved the prediction of readmission after hospitalization for heart failure compared with LR and provided the greatest predictive range in observed readmission rates.

34977563#ABSTRACT##Breast cancer screening using Mammography serves as the earliest defense against breast cancer,, revealing anomalous tissue years before it can be detected through physical screening. Despite the use of high resolution radiography,, the presence of densely overlapping patterns challenges the consistency of human-driven diagnosis and drives interest in leveraging state-of-art localization ability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The growing availability of digitized clinical archives enables the training of deep segmentation models,, but training using the most widely available form of coarse hand-drawn annotations works against learning the precise boundary of cancerous tissue in evaluation,, while producing results that are more aligned with the annotations rather than the underlying lesions. The expense of collecting high quality pixel-level data in the field of medical science makes this even more difficult. To surmount this fundamental challenge,, we propose LatentCADx,, a deep learning segmentation model capable of precisely annotating cancer lesions underlying hand-drawn annotations,, which we procedurally obtain using joint classification training and a strict segmentation penalty. We demonstrate the capability of LatentCADx on a publicly available dataset of 2,,620 Mammogram case files,, where LatentCADx obtains classification ROC of 0.97,, AP of 0.87,, and segmentation AP of 0.75 (IOU = 0.5),, giving comparable or better performance than other models. Qualitative and precision evaluation of LatentCADx annotations on validation samples reveals that LatentCADx increases the specificity of segmentations beyond that of existing models trained on hand-drawn annotations,, with pixel level specificity reaching a staggering value of 0.90. It also obtains sharp boundary around lesions unlike other methods,, reducing the confused pixels in the output by more than 60%.

29600495#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The purpose of this project was to develop a telemedicine platform that supports home site monitoring and integrates biochemical,, physiological,, and dietary parameters for individual patients with hepatic glycogen storage disease (GSD).
29600495#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#The GSD communication platform (GCP) was designed with input from software developers,, GSD patients,, researchers,, and healthcare providers. In phase 1,, prototyping and software design of the GCP has occurred. The GCP was composed of a GSD App for patients and a GSD clinical dashboard for healthcare providers. In phase 2,, the GCP was tested by retrospective patient data entry. The following software functionalities were included (a) dietary registration and prescription module,, (b) emergency protocol module,, and (c) data import functions for continuous glucose monitor devices and activity wearables. In phase 3,, the GSD App was implemented in a pilot study of eight patients with GSD Ia (n?=?3),, GSD IIIa (n?=?1),, and GSD IX (n?=?4). Usability was measured by the system usability scale (SUS). The mean SUS score was 64/100 [range: 38-93].
29600495#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This report describes the design,, development,, and validation process of a telemedicine platform for patients with hepatic GSD. The GCP can facilitate home site monitoring and data exchange between patients with hepatic GSD and healthcare providers under varying circumstances. In the future,, the GCP may support cross-border healthcare,, second opinion processes and clinical trials,, and could possibly also be adapted for other diseases for which a medical diet is the cornerstone.

15024319#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA#Accurate visualization of the surgical field with high-resolution video imaging cameras such as the closed-coupled device (CCD) of the laparoscope can serve to insure clear visual observation of surgery and share the surgical procedure with trainees and,, or consultants in a distant location. Prior work has successfully applied optics and technical advances to achieve precise visualization in laparoscopy.
15024319#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Twenty-five thyroidectomy explorations in 15 patients were monitored and transmitted bidirectionally with audio and video data in real-time. Remotely located surgical trainees (n = 4) and medical students (n = 3) confirmed 7 different anatomic landmarks during each surgical procedure. The study used the Socrates System (Computer Motion,, Inc. [CMI],, Goleta,, CA),, an interactive telementoring system inclusive of a telestration whiteboard,, in conjunction with the AESOP robotic arm and Hermes voice command system (CMI). A 10-mm flat laparoscopic telescope was used to capture the optical surgical field. As voice,, telestrator,, or marker confirmed each anatomic landmark the image parameters of resolution,, chroma (light position and intensity),, and luminance were assessed with survey responses.
15024319#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Confirmation of greater than 90% was achieved for the majority of relevant anatomic landmarks,, which were viewed by the remote audience.
15024319#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The data presented in this study support the feasibility for mentoring and consultation to a remote audience with visual transmission of the surgical field,, which is otherwise very difficult to share. Additionally,, validation of technical protocols as teaching tools for robotic instrumentation and computer imaging of surgical fields was documented.

35942677#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE OF REVIEW#The field of digital health is evolving rapidly with applications relevant to the prediction,, detection and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). This review will summarize recent publications in these areas.
35942677#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#Machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied predominantly for AKI prediction,, but also to identify patients with AKI at higher risk of adverse outcomes,, and to discriminate different subgroups (subphenotypes) of AKI. There have been multiple publications in this area,, but a smaller number of ML models have robust external validation or the ability to run in real-time in clinical systems. Recent studies of AKI alerting systems and clinical decision support systems continue to demonstrate variable results,, which is likely to result from differences in local context and implementation strategies. In the design of AKI alerting systems,, choice of baseline creatinine has a strong effect on performance of AKI detection algorithms.

35942677#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#Further research is required to overcome barriers to the validation and implementation of ML models for AKI care. Simpler electronic systems within the electronic medical record can lead to improved care in some but not all settings,, and careful consideration of local context and implementation strategy is recommended.
18821157#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telerehabilitation is the remote delivery of rehabilitation services via information technology and telecommunication systems. There have been a number of studies that have used videoconferencing to assess speech and language skills in people with acquired neurogenic communication disorders. However,, few studies have focused on cases of apraxia of speech. In order to perform accurately differential diagnosis via the telerehabilitation medium,, it is important that validation of the assessment of apraxia of speech be established as part of the overall evidence base for telerehabilitation communication assessment protocols.
18821157#ABSTRACT#METHODS & PROCEDURES#Eleven participants with an acquired apraxia of speech were assessed simultaneously via telerehabilitation and face-to-face methods on the Apraxia Battery for Adults - 2 (ABA-2). A custom-built telerehabilitation system developed at the University of Queensland enabled real-time telerehabilitation assessment over a 128 kbit/s internet connection. Data analysis included tests of significant difference between raw scores using the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic and analysis of the degree of agreement between the two methods using weighted Kappa statistics. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were also examined for the telerehabilitation-led assessments.
18821157#ABSTRACT#OUTCOMES & RESULTS#Results revealed no significant differences between the subtest scores of the ABA-2 obtained in the telerehabilitation and face-to-face test environments (p = 0.06-0.68). Weighted Kappa statistics indicated moderate to very good agreement (0.59-1.00) between the two environments for the subtests of the ABA-2. The reliability study was hampered by small sample size; however,, the data were suggestive of reasonable reliability. Participants reported high overall satisfaction,, comfort level,, and audio and visual quality in the telerehabilitation environment. The speech-language pathologists (SLP) reported some difficulties assessing participants with severe apraxia of speech via the telerehabilitation system.
31513328#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The TISQ consists of 60 items. Twenty items cover perceived interaction in terms of health information,, affective support,, decisional control and professional/technical competence. Five items cover satisfaction with interaction and five items overall satisfaction. Remaining items reflect singularity of the caller and descriptive items of the call. The TISQ was found to exhibit good content validity,, and test-retest reliability was moderate to good (ICC = 0.39-0.84).

18821157#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS#This study suggests that valid assessment of apraxia of speech using the ABA-2 over the internet is feasible. The reliability study on the telerehabilitation assessments was encouraging with results suggesting that telerehabilitation assessment using the ABA-2 could be reliable. Findings from the participant satisfaction questionnaire were favourable. However,, comments from the SLP suggested that participants exhibiting severe apraxia of speech might be better suited to face-to-face assessment. These findings may have implications for the development of evidence-based guidelines for the use of telerehabilitation in the assessment of apraxia of speech. The authors propose that future research should include larger sample sizes with a range of participant severity levels and be conducted over higher bandwidth connections to explore further the validity and reliability of telerehabilitation assessment of apraxia of speech.

32804279#ABSTRACT##The novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed several challenges for neuromuscular disorder (NMD) patients. The risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased in all but the mildest forms of NMDs. High-risk conditions include reduced airway clearance due to oropharyngeal weakness and risk of worsening with fever,, fasting or infection Isolation requirements may have an impact on treatment regimens administered in hospital settings,, such as nusinersen,, glucosidase alfa,, intravenous immunoglobulin,, and rituximab infusions. In addition,, specific drugs for SARS-CoV2 infection under investigation impair neuromuscular function significantly; chloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended in myasthenia gravis without available ventilatory support and prolonged prone positioning may influence options for treatment. Other therapeutics may affect specific NMDs (metabolic,, mitochondrial,, myotonic diseases) and experimental approaches for Coronavirus disease 2019 may be offered "compassionately" only after consulting the patient's NMD specialist. In parallel,, the reorganization of hospital and outpatient services may change the management of non-infected NMD patients and their caregivers,, favouring at-distance approaches. However,, the literature on the validation of telehealth in this subgroup of patients is scant. Thus,, as the first wave of the pandemic is progressing,, clinicians and researchers should address these crucial open issues to ensure adequate caring for NMD patients. This manuscript summarizes available evidence so far and provides guidance for both general neurologists and NMD specialists dealing with NMD patients in the time of COVID-19.
28608999#ABSTRACT##The use of minimally invasive procedures for diagnosis and treatment decisions means that very often cytological samples are the only material available for testing. Cytology has evolved from a strictly morphological approach to the routine use of immunohistochemistry. The advent of personalized medicine has increased the demand for molecular testing,, making rapid on-site evaluation even more relevant. This article presents current rapid on-site evaluation practice patterns in different settings,, with a special focus on the variety of professionals involved. Technological advances such as telepathology can help to alleviate distance constraints. This article also provides an overview of telecytopathology,, describing challenges to its implementation and how to address them. Issues such as hardware,, personnel training,, communication,, guidelines,, validation,, use,, and future directions are highlighted.

35814822#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Many have argued that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to designing digital health is not optimal and that personalisation is essential to achieve targeted outcomes. Yet,, most digital health practitioners struggle to identify which design aspect require personalisation. Personas are commonly used to communicate patient needs in consumer-oriented digital health design,, however there is often a lack of reproducible clarity on development process and few attempts to assess their accuracy against the targeted population. In this study,, we present a transparent approach to designing and validating personas,, as well as identifying aspects of "patient work,," defined as the combined total of work tasks required to manage one's health and the contextual factors influencing such tasks,, that are sensitive to an individual's context and may require personalisation.
35814822#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A data-driven approach was used to develop and validate personas for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),, focusing on patient work. Eight different personas of T2DM patient work were constructed based physical activity,, dietary control and contextual influences of 26 elderly Australian participants (median age = 72 years) via wearable camera footage,, interviews,, and self-reported diaries. These personas were validated for accuracy and perceived usefulness for design,, both by the original participants and a younger (median age bracket = 45-54 years) independent online cohort f 131 T2DM patients from the United Kingdom and the United States.
35814822#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both the original participants and the independent online cohort reported the personas to be accurate representations of their patient work routines. For the independent online cohort,, 74% (97/131) indicated personas stratified to their levels of exercise and diet control were similar to their patient work routines. Findings from both cohorts highlight aspects that may require personalisation include daily routine,, use of time,, and social context.
35814822#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Personas made for a specific purpose can be very accurate if developed from real-life data. Our personas retained their accuracy even when tested against an independent cohort,, demonstrating their generalisability. Our data-driven approach clarified the often non-transparent process of persona development and validation,, suggesting it is possible to systematically identify whether persona components are accurate or. and which aspects require more personalisation and tailoring.

9453683#ABSTRACT##As part of the NIMH Genetics Initiative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Study Group,, a brief structured telephone interview to distinguish individuals with normal cognitive functioning from those with changes in cognition and daily functioning suggestive of early AD was developed. The Structured Telephone Interview for Dementia Assessment (STIDA),, yields a dementia score between 0 and 81 (higher scores indicating greater impairment). Subscales corresponding to the subscales of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) can be derived. The STIDA performed well as a screening instrument for mildly demented individuals. When a score of 10 or more (based on informant interview and subject testing) was used to identify mildly impaired individuals,, the STIDA had a sensitivity of .93 and a specificity of .92 for a clinician-derived CDR of 0.5 or more. The STIDA was also capable of accurately assessing the level of dementia. STIDA-derived CDR ratings agreed with clinician-derived CDR scores in 23 of 28 cases,, corresponding to an unweighted kappa of.71 and a weighted kappa of.81. A much-abbreviated short STIDA that could be administered directly to the subject was able to detect possible impairment with a sensitivity of .93 and a specificity of.77. These results suggest that the short STIDA provides a sensitive and fairly specific telephone screen for dementia,, and that the full STIDA,, consisting of an interview with a knowledgeable informant and subject testing,, approximates the success of a face-to-face clinical interview,, and provides reliable and valid screening and staging of dementia over the telephone.

31513328#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Caller satisfaction with telephone advice nursing (TAN) is generally high,, and the interaction is essential. However,, a valid questionnaire exploring caller satisfaction in TAN with focus on perceived interaction is lacking.
31513328#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop and assess content validity and test-retest reliability of a theoretically anchored questionnaire,, the Telenursing Interaction and Satisfaction Questionnaire (TISQ),, that explores caller satisfaction in TAN by focusing on perceived interaction between the caller and the telenurse.
31513328#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was performed in three stages. First,, variables relevant for patient satisfaction in health care were identified through a literature search. Variables were then structured according to the Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB),, which provided theoretical guidance. Items relevant for a TAN context were developed through consensus discussions. Then,, evaluation and refinement were performed through cognitive interviews with callers and expert ratings of the Content Validity Index (CVI). Finally,, test-retest reliability of items was evaluated in a sample of 109 individuals using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).

35006083#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic search for mobile apps available in Russia was carried out between April 1 and 15,, 2020,, December 1 and 15,, 2020,, and in March 2021 in the iPhone App Store,, Google Play Store,, and the 4PDA forum. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),, and structured searches in electronic libraries and bibliographic databases were used to evaluate the apps' evidence base. The number of features facilitating changes in lifestyle behavior was assessed using the App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS).
35006083#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified 63 mobile apps for reducing alcohol use. The mean MARS quality ratings were high for the subscales of functionality (3.92 out of 5,, SD 0.58) and aesthetics (2.96,, SD 0.76) and low for engagement (2.42,, SD 0.76) and information (1.65,, SD 0.60). Additional searches in electronic libraries and bibliographic databases (eLibrary,, CyberLeninka,, Google Scholar) yielded no studies involving the identified apps. ABACUS scores ranged from 1 to 15 out of 25,, with a mean of 5 (SD 3.24). Two of the identified apps might be useful for screening and brief interventions in Russian primary health care after improvements in content and scientific testing.
35006083#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Russian-language mobile apps for reducing alcohol use are accessible in the app stores. Many of them are aesthetically pleasing,, functional,, and easy to use. However,, information about their scientific trialing or testing is lacking. Most apps contain a low number of features that facilitate changes in lifestyle behavior. Further research should examine the context of Russian-language mobile apps for reducing alcohol use. Our findings underline the need to develop evidence-based apps to mitigate alcohol consumption in Russia and elsewhere.

35499866#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Health professionals' perceptions of persuasive design techniques for use in technological solutions to improve health workforce capability have not been previously explored.
35499866#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to explore rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability and persuasive design techniques; and translate these into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase their impact and usefulness.
35499866#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Qualitative interviews with 13 rural health professionals were conducted. Subsequently,, 32 persuasive techniques were used as a framework to deductively analyze the data. Persuasive design technique domains were Primary Task Support,, Dialog Support,, System Credibility Support,, Social Support,, and Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion.
35499866#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Persuasive design techniques can be applied across the factors that influence health workforce capability including health and personal qualities; competencies and skills; values,, attitudes,, and motivation; and factors that operate outside of work and at the team,, organizational,, and labor market levels. The majority of the 32 persuasive design techniques were reflected in the data from the interviews and led to recommendations as to how these could be translated into practice,, with the exception of scarcity. Many suggestions and persuasive design techniques link back to the need for tailored and localized solutions such as the need for country-specific-based evidence,, the wish for localized communities of practice,, learning from other rural health professionals,, and referral pathways to other clinicians. Participants identified how persuasive design techniques can optimize the user experience to help meet rural health professionals needs for more efficient systems to improve patient access to care,, quality care,, and to enable working in interprofessional team-based care. Social inclusion plays a vital role for health professionals,, indicating the importance of the Social Support domain of persuasive techniques. Overall,, health professionals were open to self-monitoring of their work performance and some professionals used wearables to monitor their health.

33184088#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Items on RECAP-V0 align strongly with published evidence,, clinical judgement and patient experience. The validation phase of this study is ongoing.
33184088#ABSTRACT#TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER#NCT04435041.
35499866#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability informed which persuasive design techniques can be used to optimize the user experience of an app. These were translated into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase likelihood of adoption. This study has also contributed to the further validation of the Persuasive Systems Design model through empirically aligning elements of the model to increase persuasive system content and functionality with real-world applied data,, in this case the health workforce capability of rural health professionals. Our findings confirm that these techniques can be used to develop a future prototype of an app that may assist health professionals in improving or maintaining their health workforce capability which in turn may increase recruitment and retention in rural areas. Health professionals need to be central during the design phase. Interventions are needed to provide a supportive environment to rural and remote health professionals to increase their rural health workforce capability.
33184088#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#To develop items for an early warning score (RECAP: REmote COVID-19 Assessment in Primary Care) for patients with suspected COVID-19 who need escalation to next level of care.
33184088#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was based in UK primary healthcare. The mixed-methods design included rapid review,, Delphi panel,, interviews,, focus groups and software development. Participants were 112 primary care clinicians and 50 patients recovered from COVID-19,, recruited through social media,, patient groups and snowballing. Using rapid literature review,, we identified signs and symptoms which are commoner in severe COVID-19. Building a preliminary set of items from these,, we ran four rounds of an online Delphi panel with 72 clinicians,, the last incorporating fictional vignettes,, collating data on R software. We refined the items iteratively in response to quantitative and qualitative feedback. Items in the penultimate round were checked against narrative interviews with 50 COVID-19 patients. We required,, for each item,, at least 80% clinician agreement on relevance,, wording and cut-off values,, and that the item addressed issues and concerns raised by patients. In focus groups,, 40 clinicians suggested further refinements and discussed workability of the instrument in relation to local resources and care pathways. This informed design of an electronic template for primary care systems.
33184088#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The prevalidation RECAP-V0 comprises a red flag alert box and 10 assessment items: pulse,, shortness of breath or respiratory rate,, trajectory of breathlessness,, pulse oximeter reading (with brief exercise test if appropriate) or symptoms suggestive of hypoxia,, temperature or fever symptoms,, duration of symptoms,, muscle aches,, new confusion,, shielded list and known risk factors for poor outcome. It is not yet known how sensitive or specific it is.

32084596#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telemedicine in a school-based setting involving partnerships between a child with asthma and health care provider can provide patients and caregivers with opportunities to better manage chronic conditions,, communicate among partners,, and collaborate for solutions in convenient locations.
32084596#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review examined outcomes for school-age children with asthma involving asthma-based telemedical education.
32084596#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses,, we searched 4 databases with terms related to asthma,, education,, and pediatrics. Included articles involved a school-based setting,, children and adolescents,, a telemedical mechanism for training,, empirical study designs,, and peer review. We extracted data regarding (a) participant background,, (b) research methods and purpose,, and (c) outcomes.
32084596#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 408 articles were identified. Five met inclusion criteria. Three studies were randomized and 2 were cohort studies. In addition to clinical and educational outcomes,, studies reported on satisfaction,, self-management,, asthma knowledge gain,, and quality of life (QOL). We found support for caregiver/parent QOL and participant self-management behaviors. We also found mixed results for participant QOL. Clinical outcomes showed mixed support regarding airway inflammation improvement,, medication use improvement,, improvements in symptom burden and symptom-free days,, and spirometry improvements.
32084596#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Results of real-time telemedically delivered asthma education to improve QOL,, enhance symptom management ability,, and reduce symptom burden were positive or nonsignificant. No study indicated negative effects due to telemedicine. Limited results indicate that patient education can,, under certain circumstances,, positively influence asthma burden. Further validation of intervention methods and tools as well as outcome measurement consistency is recommended.

32529042#ABSTRACT##Digital health metrics promise to advance the understanding of impaired body functions,, for example in neurological disorders. However,, their clinical integration is challenged by an insufficient validation of the many existing and often abstract metrics. Here,, we propose a data-driven framework to select and validate a clinically relevant core set of digital health metrics extracted from a technology-aided assessment. As an exemplary use-case,, the framework is applied to the Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT),, a technology-aided assessment of upper limb sensorimotor impairments. The framework builds on a use-case-specific pathophysiological motivation of metrics,, models demographic confounds,, and evaluates the most important clinimetric properties (discriminant validity,, structural validity,, reliability,, measurement error,, learning effects). Applied to 77 metrics of the VPIT collected from 120 neurologically intact and 89 affected individuals,, the framework allowed selecting 10 clinically relevant core metrics. These assessed the severity of multiple sensorimotor impairments in a valid,, reliable,, and informative manner. These metrics provided added clinical value by detecting impairments in neurological subjects that did not show any deficits according to conventional scales,, and by covering sensorimotor impairments of the arm and hand with a single assessment. The proposed framework provides a transparent,, step-by-step selection procedure based on clinically relevant evidence. This creates an interesting alternative to established selection algorithms that optimize mathematical loss functions and are not always intuitive to retrace. This could help addressing the insufficient clinical integration of digital health metrics. For the VPIT,, it allowed establishing validated core metrics,, paving the way for their integration into neurorehabilitation trials.

34465384#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Identification of reliable,, affordable,, and easy-to-use strategies for detection of dementia is sorely needed. Digital technologies,, such as individual voice recordings,, offer an attractive modality to assess cognition but methods that could automatically analyze such data are not readily available.
34465384#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND FINDINGS#We used 1264 voice recordings of neuropsychological examinations administered to participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS),, a community-based longitudinal observational study. The recordings were 73 min in duration,, on average,, and contained at least two speakers (participant and examiner). Of the total voice recordings,, 483 were of participants with normal cognition (NC),, 451 recordings were of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),, and 330 were of participants with dementia (DE). We developed two deep learning models (a two-level long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a convolutional neural network (CNN)),, which used the audio recordings to classify if the recording included a participant with only NC or only DE and to differentiate between recordings corresponding to those that had DE from those who did not have DE (i.e.,, NDE (NC+MCI)). Based on 5-fold cross-validation,, the LSTM model achieved a mean (±std) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.740 ± 0.017,, mean balanced accuracy of 0.647 ± 0.027,, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.596 ± 0.047 in classifying cases with DE from those with NC. The CNN model achieved a mean AUC of 0.805 ± 0.027,, mean balanced accuracy of 0.743 ± 0.015,, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.742 ± 0.033 in classifying cases with DE from those with NC. For the task related to the classification of participants with DE from NDE,, the LSTM model achieved a mean AUC of 0.734 ± 0.014,, mean balanced accuracy of 0.675 ± 0.013,, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.671 ± 0.015. The CNN model achieved a mean AUC of 0.746 ± 0.021,, mean balanced accuracy of 0.652 ± 0.020,, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.635 ± 0.031 in classifying cases with DE from those who were NDE.
34465384#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that automated deep learning-driven processing of audio recordings of neuropsychological testing performed on individuals recruited within a community cohort setting can facilitate dementia screening.

36166294#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our results show that VR sickness significantly decreased when a new approach was applied to VR content (in all cases,, P<.05).
35412465#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Loneliness and social isolation are associated with multiple health problems,, including depression,, functional impairment,, and death. Mobile sensing using smartphones and wearable devices,, such as fitness trackers or smartwatches,, as well as ambient sensors,, can be used to acquire data remotely on individuals and their daily routines and behaviors in real time. This has opened new possibilities for the early detection of health and social problems,, including loneliness and social isolation.
35412465#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This scoping review aimed to identify and synthesize recent scientific studies that used passive sensing techniques,, such as the use of in-home ambient sensors,, smartphones,, and wearable device sensors,, to collect data on device users' daily routines and behaviors to detect loneliness or social isolation. This review also aimed to examine various aspects of these studies,, especially target populations,, privacy,, and validation issues.
35412465#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A scoping review was undertaken,, following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Studies on the topic under investigation were identified through 6 databases (IEEE Xplore,, Scopus,, ACM,, PubMed,, Web of Science,, and Embase). The identified studies were screened for the type of passive sensing detection methods for loneliness and social isolation,, targeted population,, reliability of the detection systems,, challenges,, and limitations of these detection systems.
35412465#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After conducting the initial search,, a total of 40,,071 papers were identified. After screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria,, 29 (0.07%) studies were included in this scoping review. Most studies (20/29,, 69%) used smartphone and wearable technology to detect loneliness or social isolation,, and 72% (21/29) of the studies used a validated reference standard to assess the accuracy of passively collected data for detecting loneliness or social isolation.
35412465#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the growing use of passive sensing technologies for detecting loneliness and social isolation,, some substantial gaps still remain in this domain. A population heterogeneity issue exists among several studies,, indicating that different demographic characteristics,, such as age and differences in participants' behaviors,, can affect loneliness and social isolation. In addition,, despite extensive personal data collection,, relatively few studies have addressed privacy and ethical issues. This review provides uncertain evidence regarding the use of passive sensing to detect loneliness and social isolation. Future research is needed using robust study designs,, measures,, and examinations of privacy and ethical concerns.

36166294#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Recently,, technology that provides virtual reality (VR) content based on streaming services has been rapidly developed. However,, there have been few studies to reduce VR sickness that occurs while the user watches VR content while wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) in real time.
36166294#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The proposed approach is to apply VR sickness reduction methods in accordance with the user's real-time VR sickness level. Three methods that are known to be effective in reducing VR sickness and a single type of VR content were used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach,, which was confirmed by the experimental results.
36166294#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#From our results,, it was confirmed that VR sickness could be measured without wearing additional equipment,, and its reduction method could be applied in real time in accordance with the user's condition by the proposed approach in this paper.

32660876#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous stress on the mental health of frontline health care workers.
32660876#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress.
32660876#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians,, resident physicians,, and nursing staff,, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition,, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists.

32660876#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups,, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later,, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings,, peer support,, consensual validation,, peer-learning,, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions.
32660876#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.

30682726#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Depression is a very common condition that impairs functioning and is often untreated. More than 60% of the treatments for depressive disorder are administered in primary care settings by care providers who lack the time and expertise to treat depression. To address this issue,, we developed Ascend,, a therapist-supported,, mobile phone-delivered 8-week intervention administered at the Meru Health Online Clinic in Finland.
30682726#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We conducted two pilot studies to examine the feasibility of the Ascend intervention,, specifically,, dropout rates,, daily practice,, weekly group chat use,, and changes in depression symptoms. We also explored whether daily practice and weekly group chat use were associated with changes in depression symptoms.

30682726#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 117 Finnish adults with elevated depressive symptoms enrolled in Ascend,, a program that included daily cognitive behavioral and mindfulness meditation exercises delivered through a mobile phone app,, anonymous group chat with other users,, and chat/phone access to a licensed therapist. Eight weekly themes were delivered in a fixed,, sequential format. Depression symptoms were measured at baseline,, every second week during the intervention,, immediately after the intervention,, and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat repeated-measures analysis of variance and linear regression models.
30682726#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This therapist-supported,, mobile phone-delivered treatment for depression is feasible and associated with reduced depression symptoms. Design features that enhance daily practice and group chat use are areas of future investigation. Validation of these results using a controlled study design is needed to establish the evidence base for the Ascend intervention.
15666487#ABSTRACT##The authors had experienced the telediagnosis on digital snapshots of standard radiology imaging (chest,, abdomen,, and bones),, sent by e-mailing,, to support the medical doctors working in remote areas of developing countries. In order to validate the overall procedure,, the authors have set up a simulating model and estimated some parameters of accuracy of the diagnosis on digital snapshots against the golden standard of the diagnosis by direct look. The study concerned the standard X-ray tests of one hundred randomly-selected patients out of a hospital archive. Four years later the diagnosis by direct look,, the team of radiologists carried out the blind cross check on the digital snapshots of the radiograms and stated their second diagnosis. Sensibility,, specificity,, predictive value of positives,, predictive value of negatives and efficiency of the whole series have been 83.0,, 95.1,, 96.1,, 79.6 and 88.0%. By breaking up the series by apparatus,, the skeleton test shows similar data of the whole series. The chest test shows a specificity and predictive value of positives of 100.0%. Although the number of cases is low,, the abdomen test apparently shows a sensibility and predictive value of negatives as high as 100%,, but a lower specificity and predictive value of negatives (85.7 and 87.5%). Though this data is supportive to the validation of the procedure,, even better results are supposedly achieved by increasing the quality of the snapshots and by improving the skills of using the software.

34365801#ABSTRACT##Background Our Cardiac High Acuity Monitoring Program (CHAMP) uses home video telemetry (HVT) as an adjunct to monitor infants with single ventricle during the interstage period. This study describes the development of an objective early warning score using HVT,, for identification of infants with single ventricle at risk for clinical deterioration and unplanned hospital admissions (UHA). Methods and Results Six candidate scoring parameters were selected to develop a pragmatic score for routine evaluation of HVT during the interstage period. We evaluated the individual and combined ability of these parameters to predict UHA. All infants with single ventricle monitored at home by CHAMP between March 2014 and March 2018 were included. Videos obtained within 48 hours before UHA were compared with videos obtained at baseline. We used binary logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate the parameters' performance in discriminating the outcome of interest. Thirty-nine subjects with 64 UHA were included. We compared 64 pre-admission videos to 64 paired baseline videos. Scoring was feasible for a mean of 91.6% (83.6%-98%) of all observations. Three different HVT score models were proposed,, and a final model composed of respiratory rate,, respiratory effort,, color,, and behavior exhibited an excellent discriminatory capability with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93% (89%-98%). HVT score of 5 was associated with specificity of 93.8% and sensitivity of 88.7% in predicting UHA. Conclusions We developed a feasible and reproducible HVT score that can serve as a tool to predict UHA in infants with single ventricle. Future directions involve prospective,, multicenter validation of this tool.

32551815#ABSTRACT#CONTEXT.—#The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is placing unparalleled burdens on regional and institutional resources in medical facilities across the globe. This disruption is causing unprecedented downstream effects to traditionally established channels of patient care delivery,, including those of essential anatomic pathology services. With Washington state being the initial North American COVID-19 epicenter,, the University of Washington in Seattle has been at the forefront of conceptualizing and implementing innovative solutions in order to provide uninterrupted quality patient care amidst this growing crisis.
32551815#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE.—#To conduct a rapid validation study assessing our ability to reliably provide diagnostic neuropathology services via a whole slide imaging (WSI) platform as part of our departmental COVID-19 planning response.
32551815#ABSTRACT#DESIGN.—#This retrospective study assessed diagnostic concordance of neuropathologic diagnoses rendered via WSI as compared to those originally established via traditional histopathology in a cohort of 30 cases encompassing a broad range of neurosurgical and neuromuscular entities. This study included the digitalization of 93 slide preparations,, which were independently examined by groups of board-certified neuropathologists and neuropathology fellows.
32551815#ABSTRACT#RESULTS.—#There were no major or minor diagnostic discrepancies identified in either the attending neuropathologist or neuropathology trainee groups for either the neurosurgical or neuromuscular case cohorts.
32551815#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS.—#Our study demonstrates that accuracy of neuropathologic diagnoses and interpretation of ancillary preparations via WSI are not inferior to those generated via traditional microscopy. This study provides a framework for rapid subspecialty validation and deployment of WSI for diagnostic purposes during a pandemic event.

30194059#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Disease-related malnutrition is a common challenge among hospitalized patients. There seems to be a lack of an effective system to follow-up nutritional monitoring and treatment of patients at nutritional risk after risk assessment. We identify a need for a more standardized system to prevent and treat disease-related malnutrition.
30194059#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to develop a dietary assessment app for tablets for use in a hospital setting and to evaluate the app's ability to measure individual intake of energy,, protein,, liquid,, and food and beverage items among hospitalized patients for two days. We also aimed to measure patients' experiences using the app.
30194059#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We have developed the MyFood app,, which consists of three modules: 1) collection of information about the patient,, 2) dietary assessment function,, and 3) evaluation of recorded intake compared to individual needs. We used observations from digital photography of the meals,, combined with partial weighing of the meal components,, as a reference method to evaluate the app's dietary assessment system for two days. Differences in the intake estimations of energy,, protein,, liquid,, and food and beverage items between MyFood and the photograph method were analyzed on both group and individual level.
30194059#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Thirty-two patients hospitalized at Oslo University Hospital were included in the study. The data collection period ran from March to May 2017. About half of the patients had =90% agreement between MyFood and the photograph method for energy,, protein,, and liquid intake on both recording days. Dinner was the meal with the lowest percent agreement between methods. MyFood overestimated patients' intake of bread and cereals and underestimated fruit consumption. Agreement between methods increased from day 1 to day 2 for bread and cereals,, spreads,, egg,, yogurt,, soup,, hot dishes,, and desserts. Ninety percent of participants reported that MyFood was easy to use,, and 97% found the app easy to navigate.
30194059#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We developed the MyFood app as a tool to monitor dietary intake among hospitalized patients at nutritional risk. The recorded intake of energy,, protein,, and liquid using MyFood showed good agreement with the photograph method for the majority of participants. The app's ability to estimate intake within food groups was good,, except for bread and cereals which were overestimated and fruits which were underestimated. The app was well accepted among study participants and has the potential to be a dietary assessment tool for use among patients in clinical practice.
34081022#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Multiple symptoms of suicide risk have been assessed based on visual and auditory information,, including flattened affect,, reduced movement,, and slowed speech.

35403853#ABSTRACT##Since the COVID-19 pandemic started,, there have been changes in clinical practice to limit transmission,, such as switching from face-to-face to remote consultations. We aimed to study the influence of technical factors on remote consultations in our experience during the pandemic. 12 clinicians completed data collection forms after consultations,, recording the technology used (video vs phone); technical problems encountered; discharge or subsequent appointment status; and technical aspects of the consultation process using 0-10 numerical rating scales (NRS) (Time Adequate; Relevant History; Physical Exam; Management Plan; and Communication Quality). Data were collated on an MS Access 2016 database and transferred to SPSS version 25 for statistics. Of 285 forms valid for analysis,, 48 (16.8%) had video consultations. Of 259 forms with technical problems data recorded,, 48 (18.5%) had a technical problem. Video patients were significantly younger (mean 49.3 vs 61.3 years,, p?<?0.001),, had higher scores on Physical Exam scale (mean 4.0 vs 2.6,, p?<?0.001),, but had no significant difference on Management Plan scale (7.3 vs 7.2). Those with technical problems were more common among video consultations (33.3% vs 15.4%,, p?=?0.005),, had lower scores on Time Adequate scale (7.7 vs 8.7,, p?<?0.001) and Communication Quality scale (7.1 vs 8.4,, p?<?0.001),, but had no significant difference on Management Plan scale (7.3 vs 7.2). The strongest correlation of Management Plan scale was with Communication Quality scale (Rho?=?0.64). Of the NRS,, a 1-point reduction in scores on Management Plan scale was the strongest predictor of subsequent face-to-face appointment (Odds Ratio 1.88,, 95% CI 1.58-2.24),, and this remained an independent predictor in multivariate analysis (adjusted OR 1.90,, 1.57-2.31). Having a technical problem was inversely associated with the outcome of a subsequent face-to-face appointment (OR 0.17,, 0.04-0.74),, and this remained significant after adjustment for Management Plan in multivariate analysis (adjusted OR 0.09,, 0.12-0.54). Video patients were younger suggesting a preference for video amongst younger patients. Although technical problems were more common with video,, having a video consultation or a technical problem had no significant impact on management plan. Scoring lower on the Management Plan scale was the strongest predictor of,, and independently associated with,, requesting a subsequent face-to-face appointment. The inverse relationship of technical problems with subsequent face-to-face appointment request will need validation in further studies.

32399511#ABSTRACT##The proliferation of digital technologies and the application of sophisticated data analysis techniques are increasingly viewed as having the potential to transform translational research and precision medicine. While digital technologies are rapidly applied in innovative ways to develop new diagnostics and therapies,, the ultimate approval and adoption of these emerging methods presents several scientific and regulatory challenges. To better understand and address these regulatory science gaps,, a working group of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program convened the Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine Forum focused on digital health,, particularly examining gaps in the use,, validation,, and interpretation of data from sensors that collect and tools that analyze digital biomarkers. The key findings and recommendations provided here emerged from the Forum and include the need to enhance areas related to data standards,, data quality and validity,, knowledge management,, and building trust between all stakeholders.

9735425#ABSTRACT##Radiographs are ordered and interpreted for immediate clinical decisions 24 hours a day by emergency physicians (EP's). The Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Care Organizations requires that all these images be reviewed by radiologists and that there be some mechanism for quality improvement (QI) for discrepant readings. There must be a log of discrepancies and documentation of follow up activities,, but this alone does not guarantee effective Q.I. Radiologists reviewing images from the previous day and night often must guess at the preliminary interpretation of the EP and whether follow up action is necessary. EP's may remain ignorant of the final reading and falsely assume the initial diagnosis and treatment were correct. Some hospitals use a paper system in which the EP writes a preliminary interpretation on the requisition slip,, which will be available when the radiologist dictates the final reading. Some hospitals use a classification of discrepancies based on clinical import and urgency,, and communicated to the EP on duty at the time of the official reading,, but may not communicate discrepancies to the EP's who initial read the images. Our computerized radiology department and picture archiving and communications system have increased technologist and radiologist productivity,, and decreased retakes and lost films. There are fewer face-to-face consultants of radiologists and clinicians,, but more communication by telephone and electronic annotation of PACS images. We have integrated the QI process for emergency department (ED) images into the PACS,, and gained advantages over the traditional discrepancy log. Requisitions including clinical indications are entered into the Hospital Information System and then appear on the PACS along with images on readings. The initial impression,, time of review,, and the initials of the EP are available to the radiologist dictating the official report. The radiologist decides if there is a discrepancy,, and whether it is category I (potentially serious,, needs immediate follow-up),, category II (moderate risk,, follow-up in one day),, or category III (low risk,, follow-up in several days). During the working day,, the radiologist calls immediately for category I discrepancies. Those noted from the evening,, night,, or weekend before are called to the EP the next morning. All discrepancies with the preliminary interpretation are communicated to the EP and are kept in a computerized log for review by a radiologist at a weekly ED teaching conference. This system has reduced the need for the radiologist to ask or guess what the impression was in the ED the night before. It has reduced the variability in recording of impressions by EP's,, in communication back from radiologists,, in the clinical] follow-up made,, and in the documentation of the whole QI process. This system ensures that EP's receive notification of their discrepant readings,, and provides continuing education to all the EP's on interpreting images on their patients.

36382716#ABSTRACT##The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has publicly recognized the importance of improving drug development efficiency,, deeming translational biomarkers a top priority. The use of imaging biomarkers has been associated with increased rates of drug approvals. An appropriate level of validation provides a pragmatic way to choose and implement these biomarkers. Standardizing imaging modality selection,, data acquisition protocols,, and image analysis (in ways that are agnostic to equipment and algorithms) have been key to imaging biomarker deployment. The best known examples come from studies done via precompetitive collaboration efforts,, which enable input from multiple stakeholders and data sharing. Digital health technologies (DHTs) provide an opportunity to measure meaningful aspects of patient health,, including patient function,, for extended periods of time outside of the hospital walls,, with objective,, sensor-based measures. We identified the areas where learnings from the imaging biomarker field can accelerate the adoption and widespread use of DHTs to develop novel treatments. As with imaging,, technical validation parameters and performance acceptance thresholds need to be established. Approaches amenable to multiple hardware options and data processing algorithms can be enabled by sharing DHT data and by cross-validating algorithms. Data standardization and creation of shared databases will be vital. Pre-competitive consortia (public-private partnerships and professional societies that bring together all stakeholders,, including patient organizations,, industry,, academic experts,, and regulators) will advance the regulatory maturity of DHTs in clinical trials.
34081022#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We utilized video to quantify facial,, vocal,, and movement markers associated with mood,, emotion,, and motor functioning from a structured clinical conversation in 20 patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital following a suicide risk attempt. Measures were calculated using open-source deep learning algorithms for processing facial expressivity,, head movement,, and vocal characteristics. Derived digital measures of flattened affect,, reduced movement,, and slowed speech were compared to suicide risk with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation controlling for age and sex,, using multiple linear regression.
34081022#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Digital measurements of facial affect,, movement,, and speech prevalence demonstrated strong effect sizes and linear associations with the severity of suicidal ideation.

30722763#ABSTRACT##Digital pathology is defined as the ability to examine digitized microscopic slides and to generate qualitative and quantitative data. The field of digital pathology is rapidly evolving and has the potential to revolutionize toxicologic pathology. Techniques such as automated 2-D image analysis,, whole slide imaging,, and telepathology are already considered "mature" technologies and have been used for decades in exploratory studies; however,, many organizations are reluctant to use digital pathology in regulatory toxicology studies. Innovative technologies using digitized slides including high-content imaging modalities and artificial intelligence are still under development but are increasingly used in toxicologic pathology. While software validation requirements are already described,, clear guidance for application of these rules to the digital pathology field are few and the acceptance of these technologies by regulatory authorities remains necessary for successful adoption of digital pathology into the mainstream of toxicologic pathology. This topic was discussed during a roundtable at the 2018 Annual Congress of the French Society of Toxicologic Pathology. This opinion article summarizes the discussion regarding the current questions and challenges on the integration of innovative digital pathology tools within a good laboratory practice framework and is meant to stimulate further discussion among the toxicologic pathology community. *This is an opinion article submitted to the Toxicologic Pathology Forum and does not constitute an official position of the Society of Toxicologic Pathology or the journal Toxicologic Pathology.

12537921#ABSTRACT##We compared a computerized version of the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) cognitive assessment test battery and a completely automated telephone version of the same battery. These assessed aspects of attention,, working memory and long-term memory. Both methods were used to assess the cognitive performance of a cohort of 30 people with confirmed chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and a group of 30 healthy controls matched for age and education. The CFS group had significantly slower reaction times on all four cognitive measures on both the computerized and telephone tests. The mood data followed similar patterns inthe computer and telephone assessments. The results from both forms of the test battery confirmed the pattern and severity of cognitive impairment in CFS. Furthermore,, the two methods of testing were similarly sensitive in detecting cognitive deficits. The incapacitating nature of CFS may cause problems for researchers if the restrictions to mobility affect the representativeness of the study group. The findings of the present study support the use of a fully automated telephone cognitive testing system for detecting deficits in CFS.

34074037#ABSTRACT##Background and Objectives: Thyroid nodules are lumps of solid or liquid-filled tumors that form inside the thyroid gland,, which can be malignant or benign. Our aim was to test whether the described features of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) could improve radiologists' decision making when integrated into a computer system. In this study,, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system integrated into multiple-instance learning (MIL) that would focus on benign-malignant classification. Data were available from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Materials and Methods: There were 99 cases (33 Benign and 66 malignant). In this study,, the median filter and image binarization were used for image pre-processing and segmentation. The grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract seven ultrasound image features. These data were divided into 87% training and 13% validation sets. We compared the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms based on their accuracy score,, sensitivity,, and specificity. The outcome measure was whether the thyroid nodule was benign or malignant. We also developed a graphic user interface (GUI) to display the image features that would help radiologists with decision making. Results: ANN and SVM achieved an accuracy of 75% and 96% respectively. SVM outperformed all the other models on all performance metrics,, achieving higher accuracy,, sensitivity,, and specificity score. Conclusions: Our study suggests promising results from MIL in thyroid cancer detection. Further testing with external data is required before our classification model can be employed in practice.

35156270#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Functional gastroduodenal disorders include functional dyspepsia,, chronic nausea and vomiting syndromes,, and gastroparesis. These disorders are common,, but their overlapping symptomatology poses challenges to diagnosis,, research,, and therapy. This study aimed to introduce and validate a standardized patient symptom-logging system and App to aid in the accurate reporting of gastroduodenal symptoms for clinical and research applications.
35156270#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The system was implemented in an iOS App including pictographic symptom illustrations,, and two validation studies were conducted. To assess convergent and concurrent validity,, a diverse cohort with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms undertook App-based symptom logging for 4 h after a test meal. Individual and total post-prandial symptom scores were averaged and correlated against two previously validated instruments: PAGI-SYM (for convergent validity) and PAGI-QOL (for concurrent validity). To assess face and content validity,, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with patients.
35156270#ABSTRACT#KEY RESULTS#  = -0.34; concurrent validity; p = 0.002). Interviews demonstrated that the pictograms had adequate face and content validity.
35156270#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES#The continuous patient symptom-logging App demonstrated robust convergent,, concurrent,, face,, and content validity when used within a 4-h post-prandial test protocol. The App will enable standardized symptom reporting and is anticipated to provide utility in both research and clinical practice.

32532222#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#This study evaluates the accuracy of an automated classification tool of single attacks of the two major primary headache disorders migraine and tension-type headache used in an electronic headache diary.
32532222#ABSTRACT#METHODS#One hundred two randomly selected reported headache attacks from an electronic headache-diary of patients using the medical app M-sense were classified by both a neurologist with specialisation in headache medicine and an algorithm,, constructed based on the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine and tension-type headache. The level of agreement between the headache specialist and the algorithm was compared by using a kappa statistic. Cases of disagreement were analysed in a disagreement validity assessment.
32532222#ABSTRACT#RESULT#The neurologist and the algorithm classified migraines with aura (MA),, migraines without aura (MO),, tension-type headaches (TTH) and non-migraine or non-TTH events. Of the 102 headache reports,, 86 cases were fully agreed on,, and 16 cases not,, making the level of agreement unweighted kappa 0.74 and representing a substantial level of agreement. Most cases of disagreement (12 out of 16) were due to inadvertent mistakes of the neurologist identified in the disagreement validity assessment. The second most common reason (3 out of 16) was insufficient information for classification by the neurologist.
32532222#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The substantial level of agreement indicates that the classification tool is a valuable instrument for automated evaluation of electronic headache diaries,, which can thereby support the diagnostic and therapeutic clinical processes. Based on this study's results,, additional diagnostic functionalities of primary headache management apps can be implemented. Finally,, future research can use this classification algorithm for large scale database analysis for epidemiological studies.

29868227#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The aim of this study was to design and develop a set of,, short message service (SMS) to promote specialized mental health care seeking within the framework of the Allillanchu Project.
29868227#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The design phase consisted of 39 interviews with potential recipients of the SMS,, about use of cellphones,, and perceptions and motivations towards seeking mental health care. After the data collection,, the research team developed a set of seven SMS for validation. The content validation phase consisted of 24 interviews. The participants answered questions regarding their understanding of the SMS contents and rated its appeal.

29868227#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The seven SMS subjected to content validation were tailored to the recipient using their name. The reminder message included the working hours of the psychology service at the patient's health center. The motivational messages addressed perceived barriers and benefits when seeking mental health services. The average appeal score of the seven SMS was 9.0 (SD±0.4) of 10 points. Participants did not make significant suggestions to change the wording of the messages.
29868227#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Five SMS were chosen to be used. This approach is likely to be applicable to other similar low-resource settings,, and the methodology used can be adapted to develop SMS for other chronic conditions.

23207446#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To assess the application of TeleCyP for real-time fine-needle aspiration interpretation (RFI) necessary for case management and specimen triage.
23207446#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#Twenty-two endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided mediastinal and pulmonary cases were included in the learning phase to determine the time and efficiency of TeleCyP. Slides were scanned by a cytopathology fellow in real time,, and high-speed transmitted images over a secure network were interpreted by a cytopathologist while maintaining audio communication. In the validation phase,, an additional 38 pancreas cases from endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were evaluated recapitulating the RFI scenario from the learning phase. The cytopathologist was blinded to the results of the diagnosis in both phases.
23207446#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The time to provide assessment of specimen adequacy and a preliminary diagnosis was 53 s in the learning phase and 49 s in the validation phase. There was 100% correlation between RFI and TeleCyP assessment for specimen adequacy. TeleCyP particularly posed challenges in providing definitive interpretation on EUS-fine-needle aspiration of some of the pancreatic solid masses (11%,, 4/36).
23207446#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#TeleCyP can serve as a powerful alternative,, time-efficient strategy to provide RFI,, and for specimen triaging which is critical for personalized medicine and patient management.

32250314#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The emergence of new technologies measuring outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD) to complement the existing clinical rating scales has introduced the possibility of measurement occurring in patients' own homes whilst they freely live and carry out normal day-to-day activities.
32250314#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This systematic review seeks to provide an overview of what technology is being used to test which outcomes in PD from free-living participant activity in the setting of the home environment. Additionally,, this review seeks to form an impression of the nature of validation and clinimetric testing carried out on the technological device(s) being used.
32250314#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Five databases (Medline,, Embase,, PsycInfo,, Cochrane and Web of Science) were systematically searched for papers dating from 2000. Study eligibility criteria included: adults with a PD diagnosis; the use of technology; the setting of a home or home-like environment; outcomes measuring any motor and non-motor aspect relevant to PD,, as well as activities of daily living; unrestricted/unscripted activities undertaken by participants.
32250314#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#65 studies were selected for data extraction. There were wide varieties of participant sample sizes (<10 up to hundreds) and study durations (<2 weeks up to a year). The metrics evaluated by technology,, largely using inertial measurement units in wearable devices,, included gait,, tremor,, physical activity,, bradykinesia,, dyskinesia and motor fluctuations,, posture,, falls,, typing,, sleep and activities of daily living.
32250314#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Home-based free-living testing in PD is being conducted by multiple groups with diverse approaches,, focussing mainly on motor symptoms and sleep.

34018047#ABSTRACT##Digital therapeutics (DTx) is a section of digital health defined by the DTx Alliance as "delivering evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by software to prevent,, manage,, or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in concert with medications,, devices,, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes". Chronic disabling diseases could greatly benefit from DTx. In this narrative review,, we provide an overview of DTx in the care of patients with neurological dysfunctions.

32910735#ABSTRACT## = 67.5 years). Signal-related factors: SNR of the experimental patch was not inferior to the SNR of the conventional electrodes (p < .0056). Similarly,, baseline amplitude obtained with the experimental patch was not inferior to that obtained with conventional electrodes (p < .0001). Finally,, normalized amplitude values were equivalent across swallows (5 ml: p < .025; 10 ml: p < .0012),, and sEMG burst duration was also equivalent (5 ml: p < .0001; 10 ml: p < .0001). Safety/preclinical factors: The experimental patch resulted in fewer mild adverse effects. Participant satisfaction was higher with the experimental patch (p = .0476,, d = 0.226). Conclusions Our new wearable sEMG patch is equivalent with widely used conventional sEMG electrodes in terms of technical performance. In addition,, our patch is safe,, and healthy older adults are satisfied with it. With lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic,, efforts to develop optimal swallowing telerehabilitation devices are more urgent than ever. Upon further validation,, this new technology has the potential to improve rehabilitation and telerehabilitation efforts for patients with dysphagia.

35106643#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#In this correspondence,, we highlight general and domain-specific caveats in the development and validation of prediction models.
35106643#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Development and use of the "QUiPP" application,, a tool for preterm birth prediction which is supported by the United Kingdom National Health Service,, is scrutinised and commented on.
35106643#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We highlight and elaborate ten points which may be perceived to be unclear or potentially misleading.
35106643#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#While the QUiPP application has high potential,, it lacks transparency (on certain aspects related to model development) and proper validation. This precludes transportability to settings with other treatment policies and to other countries where the app has been made publicly available.

30578234#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of new mobile technologies in the health and social welfare sectors is already a reality. The ICT Social Health Foundation,, in accordance with the technology strategy of the Catalan government's Ministry of Health and its Ministry of Labour,, Social Affairs and Families,, is leading an initiative to create a public library of apps for its AppSalut Site.
30578234#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this paper is to present an account of the design of the project,, with a global perspective,, applied to the Catalan ecosystem,, which can be divided into 3 areas: the framework governing the recommendation and prescription of apps,, the subset of interoperability for mobile environments,, and the data storage infrastructure.
30578234#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The security and credibility of the apps included in the catalog is ensured by submitting them to an accreditation process in the public domain that provides users with the guarantee that they are fit for purpose and trustworthy for the management and care of their health,, while providing health care professionals with the possibility of recommending the apps in the doctor's surgery,, as well as adding the information generated by the users' mobile devices to the information systems of the various organizations concerned.

30578234#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#An examination of the abovementioned areas suggests possibilities for improvements in the future. The experience obtained from the development of this element has shown the heterogeneity of the vocabularies used,, as expected,, due to the lack of awareness on the part of the developers regarding the need to standardize the information generated by the app,, requiring the foundation to take on the role of consultant.
30578234#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The project has evolved in keeping with changes in the technological and social paradigm and responds very satisfactorily to the needs posed to it. It can be seen as a landmark experience in mobile strategies in the fields of health and welfare of any public health system. The experience has shown itself to be feasible in organizational terms,, necessary in any attempt to integrate mobile technologies into public health practice,, and a global pioneer in the field.

29848473#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Hypertensive disorders are the most common complications during pregnancy,, occurring in 5% to 11% of pregnancies; gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are the leading causes of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality,, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where maternal and perinatal mortality ratios are still high. Pregnant women with hypertensive disorders could greatly benefit from mobile health (mHealth) solutions as a novel way to identify and control early symptoms,, as shown in an increasing number of publications in the field. Such digital health solutions may overcome access limiting factors and the lack of skilled medical professionals and finances commonly presented in resource-poor environments.
29848473#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to conduct a literature review of mHealth solutions used as support in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy,, with the objective to identify the most relevant protocols and prototypes that could influence and improve current clinical practice.
29848473#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A methodological review following a scoping methodology was conducted. Manuscripts published in research journals reporting technical information of mHealth solutions for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were included,, categorizing articles in different groups: Diagnosis and Monitoring,, mHealth Decision Support System,, Education,, and Health Promotion,, and seven research questions were posed to study the manuscripts.

29848473#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The search in electronic research databases yielded 327 articles. After removing duplicates,, 230 articles were selected for screening. Finally,, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria,, and data were extracted from them. Very positive results in the improvement of maternal health and acceptability of solutions were found,, although most of the studies involved a small number of participants,, and none were complete clinical studies. Accordingly,, none of the reported prototypes were integrated in the different health care systems. Only 4 studies used sensors for physiological measurements,, and only 2 used blood pressure sensors despite the importance of this physiological parameter in the control of hypertension. The reported mHealth solutions have great potential to improve clinical practice in areas lacking skilled medical professionals or with a low health care budget,, of special relevance in LMIC,, although again,, no extensive clinical validation has been carried out in these environments.
29848473#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#mHealth solutions hold enormous potential to support hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and improve current clinical practice. Although very positive results have been reported in terms of usability and the improvement of maternal health,, rigorous complete clinical trials are still necessary to support integration in health care systems. There is a clear need for simple mHealth solutions specifically developed for resource-poor environments that meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG); of enormous interest in LMIC.

25565398#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Telepathology may play an important role in pathology consultation and quality control for cancer diagnosis in China,, as the country has the largest population of cancer patients worldwide. In 2011,, the Pathology Quality Control Center of China and Ministry of Health developed and implemented a nationwide telepathology consultation and quality control program for cancer diagnosis in China. We here report the results of the two-year implementation and experiences.
25565398#ABSTRACT#METHODS#the program built an Internet based telepathology platform to connect participating hospitals and expert consultants. The hardware and software used for the platform were validated in previous validation studies in China. The program had three regional centers consisting of Peking Union Medical College,, Huasi Medical College of Sichuan and 2nd affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University. It also had 20 provincial consultation centers based in the provincial referral hospitals. 80 provincial or national pathologists served as expert consultants for the program,, providing telepathology consultation for cancer diagnosis for more than 60 participating hospitals.
25565398#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#our results of two years' implementation indicated that telepathology could solve the problem of uneven distribution of pathology resources and provide a solution for countrywide pathology quality control in China. Telepathology could play an important role in improving pathology diagnosis in China.

35511253#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#With the aging of populations worldwide,, early detection of cognitive impairments has become a research and clinical priority,, particularly to enable preventive intervention for dementia. Automated analysis of the drawing process has been studied as a promising means for lightweight,, self-administered cognitive assessment. However,, this approach has not been sufficiently tested for its applicability across populations.
35511253#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of automated analysis of the drawing process for estimating global cognition in community-dwelling older adults across populations in different nations.
35511253#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We collected drawing data with a digital tablet,, along with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores for assessment of global cognition,, from 92 community-dwelling older adults in the United States and Japan. We automatically extracted 6 drawing features that characterize the drawing process in terms of the drawing speed,, pauses between drawings,, pen pressure,, and pen inclinations. We then investigated the association between the drawing features and MoCA scores through correlation and machine learning-based regression analyses.

37327053#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention,, but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers when seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated,, gender dysphoria is associated with depression,, anxiety,, suicidality,, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely,, safely,, and flexibly,, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating how accurately these methods model clinical constructs.
37327053#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP,, using transgender and nonbinary people's social media data.
37327053#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings suggest that ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have significant potential to be integrated into technology-delivered interventions. The results contribute to the growing evidence on the importance of incorporating ML and NLP designs in clinical science,, especially when studying marginalized populations.

37327053#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Overall,, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit (Reddit Inc) posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science,, a research team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria was present in each Reddit post (ie,, the dependent variable). NLP (eg,, n-grams,, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count,, word embedding,, sentiment,, and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable in predicting gender dysphoria. Misclassified posts were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria.
37327053#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Results indicated that a supervised ML algorithm (ie,, optimized extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]) modeled gender dysphoria with a high degree of accuracy (0.84),, precision (0.83),, and speed (1.23 seconds). Of the NLP-generated independent variables,, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) clinical keywords (eg,, dysphoria and disorder) were most predictive of gender dysphoria. Misclassifications of gender dysphoria were common in posts that expressed uncertainty,, featured a stressful experience unrelated to gender dysphoria,, were incorrectly coded,, expressed insufficient linguistic markers of gender dysphoria,, described past experiences of gender dysphoria,, showed evidence of identity exploration,, expressed aspects of human sexuality unrelated to gender dysphoria,, described socially based gender dysphoria,, expressed strong affective or cognitive reactions unrelated to gender dysphoria,, or discussed body image.
20144417#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of telemedicine for diabetes care has evolved over time,, proving that it contributes to patient self-monitoring,, improves glycemic control,, and provides analysis tools for decision support. The timely development of a safe and robust ambulatory artificial pancreas should rely on a telemedicine architecture complemented with automatic data analysis tools able to manage all the possible high-risk situations and to guarantee the patient's safety.
20144417#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Intelligent Control Assistant system (INCA) telemedical artificial pancreas architecture is based on a mobile personal assistant integrated into a telemedicine system. The INCA supports four control strategies and implements an automatic data processing system for risk management (ADP-RM) providing short-term and medium-term risk analyses. The system validation comprises data from 10 type 1 pump-treated diabetic patients who participated in two randomized crossover studies,, and it also includes in silico simulation and retrospective data analysis.
20144417#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The ADP-RM short-term risk analysis prevents hypoglycemic events by interrupting insulin infusion. The pump interruption has been implemented in silico and tested for a closed-loop simulation over 30 hours. For medium-term risk management,, analysis of capillary blood glucose notified the physician with a total of 62 alarms during a clinical experiment (56% for hyperglycemic events). The ADP-RM system is able to filter anomalous continuous glucose records and to detect abnormal administration of insulin doses with the pump.

32856494#ABSTRACT##To validate and assess the reliability of the Italian version of self-administered ALSFRS-R,, considering patients' clinical and cognitive features and caregiver's help. Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic,, by analyzing the results of 70 paired self-administered vs standard telephone-administered ALSFRS-R,, we calculated overall score,, single item scores,, ALSFRS-R domain scores,, King's and MiToS stage inter-rater agreement and reliability using different validated methods. We created the Italian version of self-administered ALSFRS-R following ENCALS recommendation. Results: Correlation between the two scales was 0.94 and no systematic directional bias was found. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was very high (>0.90) for the vast majority of the considered classification criteria,, especially King's total score (0.96) and MiToS score (0.94). A higher ICC was found when the patients answered the questionnaire with the caregiver's help (0.95). Conclusions: Online self-administered ALSFRS-R scale is a valid tool to stratify ALS patients into clinical stages and to implement telemedicine monitoring.

25412853#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to assess the functional outcome after stroke. Several studies on mRS showed good reliability,, feasibility,, and interrater agreement of this scale using a face-to-face assessment. However,, telephone assessment is a more time-efficient way to obtain an mRS grade than a face-to-face interview. The aim of this study was to validate the telephone assessment of mRS among the Portuguese using a structured interview in a sample of Brazilian stroke patients.
25412853#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We evaluated 50 stroke outpatients twice. The first interview was face-to-face and the second was made by telephone and the time between the two assessments ranged between 7 and 14 days. Four certified raters evaluated the patients using a structured interview based on a questionnaire previously published in the literature. Raters were blinded for the Rankin score given by the other rater. For both assessments,, the rater could also interview a caregiver if necessary.
25412853#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The patients' mean age was 62.8 ± 14.7,, mean number of years of study 5.2 ± 3.4,, 52% were males,, 55.2% of patients needed a caregiver's help to answer the questions. The majority of caregivers were female (85%),, mean age 49.1 ± 15,, and mean number of years of study 8.3 ± 3.4. Perfect agreement between the telephone and face-to-face assessments was obtained for 27 (54%) patients,, corresponding to an unweighted Kappa of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27-0.61) and a weighted Kappa of 0.89. The median of telephone assessment mRS was 3.5 (interquartile range = 2-4) and of face-to-face assessment was 4 (interquartile range = 2-5). There was no difference between the two assessments (Wilcoxon test,, p = 0.35).
25412853#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the low education level of our sample,, the telephone assessment of functional impairment of stroke patients using a translated and culturally adapted Brazilian Portuguese version of the mRS showed good validity and reliability. Therefore,, the telephone assessment of mRS can be used in clinical practice and scientific studies in Brazil.

32658876#ABSTRACT##The CoViD-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the health care's digital revolution with the unprecedented accelerated expansion of telehealth,, telemedicine and other digital health tools. Several tools have been developed and launched at national and international level to face the emergency,, including tools to perform online triage,, symptoms checking,, video visits and remote monitoring,, and to conduct local and national epidemiological surveillance studies. Artificial intelligence-based tools have also been developed to diagnose cases of CoViD-19 or to identify patients at risk. Most of these technologies have been endorsed by medical societies such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians which launched specific guidelines about their use. The growth in telemedicine services and in digital health technologies could not have occurred without important telehealth regulatory changes that have occurred in some countries aimed at promoting their use to face the CoViD-19 emergency,, such as the deregulation of the use of video conferencing and video chat systems to carry out video visits,, and the payment parity between telehealth and in clinic care. In order to decide whether to continue using these tools even after the pandemic is over,, it could be useful to perform validation and efficacy studies of these tools to study their implications on the doctor-patient relationship,, to understand if the new features can be integrated with the other technological tools already in use,, and if they can improve clinical practice and quality of care.

20421616#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Telehealth has the potential to improve children's access to speech-language pathology services. Validation of telehealth applications,, including the assessment of childhood language disorders,, is necessary for telehealth to become an accepted alternative mode of service provision. The aim of this study was to validate an Internet-based telehealth system for assessing childhood language disorders.
20421616#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Twenty-five children ages 5 to 9 years were assessed using the core language subtests of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals--4th Edition (CELF-4; Semel,, Wiig,, & Secord,, 2003). Each participant was simultaneously assessed online and face-to-face (FTF). Assessments were administered by either an online or an FTF speech-language pathologist (SLP),, but were simultaneously rated by both SLPs.
20421616#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#No significant difference was found between the online and FTF total raw scores and scaled scores for each subtest. Weighted kappas revealed very good agreement on the individual items,, total raw scores,, scaled scores,, core language score,, and severity level. Intra- and interrater reliability were determined for a sample of online ratings,, with intraclass correlation analysis revealing very good agreement on all measures.
20421616#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The results of this study support the validity and reliability of scoring the core language subtests of the CELF-4 via telehealth.

36940081#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Adherence to secondary prevention medications following acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is a predictor of future major adverse cardiovascular events. Underutilisation of these medications is associated with higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events globally.
36940081#ABSTRACT#AIM#To explore the effects of a telehealth cardiology pharmacist clinic on patient adherence to secondary prevention medications in the 12 months following ACS.
36940081#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Retrospective matched cohort study within a large regional health service comparing patient populations before and after implementation of pharmacist clinic with 12-month follow up. Patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention for ACS were consulted by the pharmacist at 1,, 3- and 12-months. Matching criteria included age,, sex,, presence of left ventricular dysfunction and ACS type. Primary outcome was difference in adherence in adherence at 12 months post ACS. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events at 12 months and validation of self-reported adherence using medication possession ratios from pharmacy dispensing records.
36940081#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There were 156 patients in this study (78 matched pairs). Analysis of adherence at 12 months demonstrated an absolute increase in adherence by 13% (31 vs. 44%,, p?=?0.038). Furthermore,, sub-optimal medical therapy (less than 3 ACS medication groups at 12 months) reduced by 23% (31 vs. 8%,, p?=?0.004).
36940081#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This novel intervention significantly improved adherence to secondary prevention medications at 12 months,, a demonstrated contributor to clinical outcomes. Primary and secondary outcomes in the intervention group were both statistically significant. Pharmacist-led follow up improves adherence and patient outcomes.

34831811#ABSTRACT##Virtual assistants are programs that interact with users through text or voice messages simulating a human-based conversation. The development of healthcare virtual assistants that use messaging platforms is rapidly increasing. Still,, there is a lack of validation of these assistants. In particular,, this work aimed to validate the effectiveness of a healthcare virtual assistant,, integrated within messaging platforms,, with the aim of improving medication adherence in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder. For this purpose,, a nine-month pilot study was designed and subsequently conducted. The virtual assistant reminds patients about their medication and provides healthcare professionals with the ability to monitor their patients. We analyzed the medication possession ratio (MPR),, measured the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c),, and obtained the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) score in the patients before and after the study. We also conducted interviews with all participants. A total of thirteen patients and five nurses used and evaluated the proposed virtual assistant using the messaging platform Signal. Results showed that on average,, the medication adherence improved. In the final interview,, 69% of the patients agreed with the idea of continuing to use the virtual assistant after the study.

31286989#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted among postpartum women (n?=?25) and FP providers (n?=?17) at 4 Kenyan maternal and child health clinics,, 2 in the Nyanza region (Kisumu and Siaya Counties) and 2 in Nairobi. Stratified purposive sampling was used to enroll postpartum women and FP providers. Data were analyzed using an inductive content analysis approach by 3 independent coders,, with consensual validation.
31286989#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#FP providers stated that the Interactive Mobile Application for Contraceptive Choice (iMACC) tool contained the necessary information about contraceptive methods for postpartum women and believed that it would be a useful tool to help women make informed,, voluntary decisions. Most women valued the decision aid content,, and described it as being useful in helping to dispel myths and misconceptions,, setting realistic expectations about potential side effects and maintaining confidentiality. Both women and providers expressed concerns about literacy and lack of familiarity with smart phones or tablets and suggested inclusion of interactive multimedia such as audio or videos to optimize the effectiveness of the tool.
31286989#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The iMACC decision aid was perceived to be an acceptable tool to deliver client-centered FP counseling by both women and providers. Counseling tools that can support FP providers to help postpartum women make informed and individualized FP decisions in resource-limited settings may help improve FP counseling and contraceptive use in the postpartum period.

27023561#ABSTRACT##The importance of an early rehabilitation process in children with cerebral palsy (CP) is widely recognized. On the one hand,, new and useful treatment tools such as rehabilitation systems based on interactive technologies have appeared for rehabilitation of gross motor movements. On the other hand,, from the therapeutic point of view,, performing rehabilitation exercises with the facial muscles can improve the swallowing process,, the facial expression through the management of muscles in the face,, and even the speech of children with cerebral palsy. However,, it is difficult to find interactive games to improve the detection and evaluation of oral-facial musculature dysfunctions in children with CP. This paper describes a framework based on strategies developed for interactive serious games that is created both for typically developed children and children with disabilities. Four interactive games are the core of a Virtual Environment called SONRIE. This paper demonstrates the benefits of SONRIE to monitor children's oral-facial difficulties. The next steps will focus on the validation of SONRIE to carry out the rehabilitation process of oral-facial musculature in children with cerebral palsy.
36264608#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Most individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a degradation in their speech intelligibility. Research on the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) to assess intelligibility is still sparse,, especially when trying to replicate communication challenges in real-life conditions (ie,, noisy backgrounds). Developing technologies to automatically measure intelligibility in noise can ultimately assist patients in self-managing their voice changes due to the disease.
36264608#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goal of this study was to pilot-test and validate the use of a customized web-based app to assess speech intelligibility in noise in individuals with dysarthria associated with PD.
36264608#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In total,, 20 individuals with dysarthria associated with PD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) recorded a set of sentences using their phones. The Google Cloud ASR API was used to automatically transcribe the speakers' sentences. An algorithm was created to embed speakers' sentences in +6-dB signal-to-noise multitalker babble. Results from ASR performance were compared to those from 30 listeners who orthographically transcribed the same set of sentences. Data were reduced into a single event,, defined as a success if the artificial intelligence (AI) system transcribed a random speaker or sentence as well or better than the average of 3 randomly chosen human listeners. These data were further analyzed by logistic regression to assess whether AI success differed by speaker group (HCs or speakers with dysarthria) or was affected by sentence length. A discriminant analysis was conducted on the human listener data and AI transcriber data independently to compare the ability of each data set to discriminate between HCs and speakers with dysarthria.
36264608#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The data analysis indicated a 0.8 probability (95% CI 0.65-0.91) that AI performance would be as good or better than the average human listener. AI transcriber success probability was not found to be dependent on speaker group. AI transcriber success was found to decrease with sentence length,, losing an estimated 0.03 probability of transcribing as well as the average human listener for each word increase in sentence length. The AI transcriber data were found to offer the same discrimination of speakers into categories (HCs and speakers with dysarthria) as the human listener data.

36264608#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#ASR has the potential to assess intelligibility in noise in speakers with dysarthria associated with PD. Our results hold promise for the use of AI with this clinical population,, although a full range of speech severity needs to be evaluated in future work,, as well as the effect of different speaking tasks on ASR.

21489185#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Standardization and validation of the color displayed by digital slides is an important aspect of digital pathology implementation. While the most common reason for color variation is the variance in the protocols and practices in the histology lab,, the color displayed can also be affected by variation in capture parameters (for example,, illumination and filters),, image processing and display factors in the digital systems themselves.
21489185#ABSTRACT#METHOD#We have been developing techniques for color validation and optimization along two paths. The first was based on two standard slides that are scanned and displayed by the imaging system in question. In this approach,, one slide is embedded with nine filters with colors selected especially for H&E stained slides (looking like tiny Macbeth color chart); the specific color of the nine filters were determined in our previous study and modified for whole slide imaging (WSI). The other slide is an H&E stained mouse embryo. Both of these slides were scanned and the displayed images were compared to a standard. The second approach was based on our previous multispectral imaging research.
21489185#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#As a first step,, the two slide method (above) was used to identify inaccurate display of color and its cause,, and to understand the importance of accurate color in digital pathology. We have also improved the multispectral-based algorithm for more consistent results in stain standardization. In near future,, the results of the two slide and multispectral techniques can be combined and will be widely available. We have been conducting a series of researches and developing projects to improve image quality to establish Image Quality Standardization. This paper discusses one of most important aspects of image quality - color.

17368543#ABSTRACT#METHODS#After pupillary dilation,, a trained ophthalmic photographer obtained 2 sets of images: standard ETDRS,, stereoscopic 7-field 35-mm film photographs and high-resolution,, digital images of the same 7 standard fields (stereoscopic images of fields 1 and 2). Two masked readers graded both sets of images. The 35-mm film photographs were graded by hand using a written template. Digital photographs were compressed,, uploaded to a web site,, and graded by a web-based,, computer-assisted ETDRS algorithm. The ETDRS level of diabetic retinopathy,, presence of retinal thickening,, and referral recommendation based on these 2 diagnoses were recorded and compared.
17368543#ABSTRACT#MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES#The presence of CSME,, ETDRS level of diabetic retinopathy,, and referral threshold diabetic retinopathy.
17368543#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Film and compressed digital grading levels were compared using a simplified ETDRS categorization scheme. Film and digital gradings were highly correlated with exact agreements for level of diabetic retinopathy,, CSME,, and referral thresholds >87% and kappa levels >0.71. McNemar's testing found no statistically significant difference between compressed digital images and film when comparing referral thresholds (defined as the presence of CSME and/or ETDRS level > or = 61; P = 0.76).
17368543#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A modified ETDRS protocol (stereoscopic images of fields 1 and 2 only) with 16:1 JPEG image compression and computer-assisted ETDRS grading algorithm has excellent reproducibility when compared to standard ETDRS stereoscopic slide-film photography. An internet-based teleophthalmology system can correctly and reliably (kappa = 0.78) identify patients requiring referral for CSME and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR; ETDRS level > or = 61).

32374274#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical activity reduces the incidences of noncommunicable diseases,, obesity,, and mortality,, but an inactive lifestyle is becoming increasingly common. Innovative approaches to monitor and promote physical activity are warranted. While individual monitoring of physical activity aids in the design of effective interventions to enhance physical activity,, a basic prerequisite is that the monitoring devices exhibit high validity.
32374274#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our goal was to assess the validity of monitoring heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) while sitting or performing light-to-vigorous physical activity with 4 popular wrist-worn wearables (Apple Watch Series 4,, Polar Vantage V,, Garmin Fenix 5,, and Fitbit Versa).
32374274#ABSTRACT#METHODS#While wearing the 4 different wearables,, 25 individuals performed 5 minutes each of sitting,, walking,, and running at different velocities (ie,, 1.1 m/s,, 1.9 m/s,, 2.7 m/s,, 3.6 m/s,, and 4.1 m/s),, as well as intermittent sprints. HR and EE were compared to common criterion measures: Polar-H7 chest belt for HR and indirect calorimetry for EE.
32374274#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Apple Watch Series 4 provides the highest validity (ie,, smallest error rates) when measuring HR while sitting or performing light-to-vigorous physical activity,, followed by the Polar Vantage V,, Garmin Fenix 5,, and Fitbit Versa,, in that order. The Apple Watch Series 4 and Polar Vantage V are suitable for valid HR measurements at the intensities tested,, but HR data provided by the Garmin Fenix 5 and Fitbit Versa should be interpreted with caution due to higher error rates at certain intensities. None of the 4 wrist-worn wearables should be employed to monitor EE at the intensities and durations tested.
32374274#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#While monitoring HR at different exercise intensities,, the standardized typical errors of the estimates were 0.09-0.62,, 0.13-0.88,, 0.62-1.24,, and 0.47-1.94 for the Apple Watch Series 4,, Polar Vantage V,, Garmin Fenix 5,, and Fitbit Versa,, respectively. Depending on exercise intensity,, the corresponding coefficients of variation were 0.9%-4.3%,, 2.2%-6.7%,, 2.9%-9.2%,, and 4.1%-19.1%,, respectively,, for the 4 wearables. While monitoring EE at different exercise intensities,, the standardized typical errors of the estimates were 0.34-1.84,, 0.32-1.33,, 0.46-4.86,, and 0.41-1.65 for the Apple Watch Series 4,, Polar Vantage V,, Garmin Fenix 5,, and Fitbit Versa,, respectively. Depending on exercise intensity,, the corresponding coefficients of variation were 13.5%-27.1%,, 16.3%-28.0%,, 15.9%-34.5%,, and 8.0%-32.3%,, respectively.

36716081#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) symptoms is an important step to its diagnosis and intervention. We developed a new screening test called "Efficient Online MCI Screening System" (EOmciSS) for use in community-dwelling older adults. It is a self-paced cognitive test to be completed within 10 minutes on tablets or smartphones in homes or care centers for older adults.
36716081#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to test the validity of EOmciSS for identifying community-dwelling older adults with MCI risks.
36716081#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants (N=827) completed EOmciSS and other screening tests for MCI. The psychometric properties tested were "subscale item difficulty,," "discriminative index,," "internal consistency,," and "construct validity." We also tested between-group discrimination using the cross-validation method in an MCI group and a normal cognitive function (NCF) group.

36716081#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 3 accuracy factors and 1 reaction time factor explained the structure of the 20 item factors. The difficulty level of accuracy factors (ie,, "trail making,," "clock drawing,," "cube copying,," "delayed recall") was 0.63-0.99,, whereas that of the reaction time factor was 0.77-0.95. The discriminative index of the medium-to-high-difficulty item factors was 0.39-0.97. The internal consistency (Cronbach a) ranged from .41 (for few item factors) to .96. The training data set contained 9 item factors (CC-Acc1,, P<.001; CD-Acc1,, P=.07; CD-Acc2,, P=.06; CD-Acc3,, P<.001; TM-Acc4,, P=.07; DR-Acc1,, P=.03; RS,, P=.06; DR-RT1,, P=.02; and DR-RT2,, P=.05) that were significant predictors for an MCI classification versus NCF classification. Depressive symptoms were identified as significant factors (P<.001) influencing the performance of participants,, and were an integral part of our test system. Age (P=.15),, number of years of education (P=.18),, and proficiency in using an electronic device (P=.39) did not significantly influence the scores nor classification of participants. Application of the MCI/NCF cutoff score (7.90 out of 9.67) to the validation data set yielded an area under the curve of 0.912 (P<.001; 95% CI 0.868-0.955). The sensitivity was 84.9%,, specificity was 85.1%,, and the Youden index was 0.70.
36716081#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#EOmciSS was valid and reliable for identifying older adults with significant risks of MCI. Our results indicate that EOmciSS has higher sensitivity and specificity than those of the Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment and the Computerized Cognitive Screen. The user interface,, online operation,, and self-paced format allowed the test system to be operated by older adults or their caregivers in different settings (eg,, home or care centers for older adults). Depressive symptoms should be an integral part in future MCI screening systems because they influence the test performance and,, hence,, MCI risk.

33343657#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The aim of the review is to discuss and analyze the recent progress on the application of big data,, artificial intelligence,, telemedicine,, block-chain platforms,, smart devices in healthcare,, and medical education. Basic Design. The publication search was carried out using Google Scholar,, PubMed,, Web of Sciences,, Medline,, Wiley Online Library,, and CrossRef databases. The review highlights the applications of artificial intelligence,, "big data,," telemedicine and block-chain technologies,, and smart devices (internet of things) for solving the real problems in healthcare and medical education. Major Findings. We identified 252 papers related to the digital health area. However,, the number of papers discussed in the review was limited to 152 due to the exclusion criteria. The literature search demonstrated that digital health technologies became highly sought due to recent pandemics,, including COVID-19. The disastrous dissemination of COVID-19 through all continents triggered the need for fast and effective solutions to localize,, manage,, and treat the viral infection. In this regard,, the use of telemedicine and other e-health technologies might help to lessen the pressure on healthcare systems. Summary. Digital platforms can help optimize diagnosis,, consulting,, and treatment of patients. However,, due to the lack of official regulations and recommendations,, the stakeholders,, including private and governmental organizations,, are facing the problem with adequate validation and approbation of novel digital health technologies. In this regard,, proper scientific research is required before a digital product is deployed for the healthcare sector.

31683938#ABSTRACT##Hypertension is one of the most prevalent diseases and is often called the "silent killer" because there are usually no early symptoms. Hypertension is also associated with multiple morbidities,, including chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Early detection and intervention are therefore important. The current routine method for diagnosing hypertension is done using a sphygmomanometer,, which can only provide intermittent blood pressure readings and can be confounded by various factors,, such as white coat hypertension,, time of day,, exercise,, or stress. Consequently,, there is an increasing need for a non-invasive,, cuff-less,, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device. Multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) is a promising new technology that can measure a range of features of the pulse,, including the pulse transit time of the arterial pulse wave,, which can be used to continuously estimate arterial blood pressure. This is achieved by detecting the pulse wave at one body site location and measuring the time it takes for it to reach a second,, distal location. The purpose of this review is to analyze the current research in multi-site PPG for blood pressure assessment and provide recommendations to guide future research. In a systematic search of the literature from January 2010 to January 2019,, we found 13 papers that proposed novel methods using various two-channel PPG systems and signal processing techniques to acquire blood pressure using multi-site PPG that offered promising results. However,, we also found a general lack of validation in terms of sample size and diversity of populations.

32975520#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The experimental results demonstrated that Java-,, Flash-,, and HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However,, for 3D,, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest frame rate of volume rendering. However,, it required the longest time for surface rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without platform dependence. Volume rendering,, surface rendering,, and fly-through performances of the Flash-based app were significantly worse than those of the other 2 apps.
32975520#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Oracle Java,, Adobe Flash,, and HTML5 have individual strengths in the development of remote access medical imaging apps. However,, HTML5 is a promising technology for remote viewing of radiological images and can provide excellent performance without requiring any plug-ins.

28666977#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The implementation of comprehensive alcohol management strategies can reduce excessive alcohol use and reduce the risk of alcohol-related harm at sporting venues. Supporting sports venues to implement alcohol management strategies via the Web may represent an effective and efficient means of reducing harm caused by alcohol in this setting. However,, the feasibility and acceptability of such an approach is unknown.
28666977#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to identify (1) the current access to and use of the Web and electronic devices by sports clubs; (2) the perceived usefulness,, ease of use,, and intention to use a Web-based program to support implementation of alcohol management policies in sports clubs; (3) the factors associated with intention to use such a Web-based support program; and (4) the specific features of such a program that sports clubs would find useful.
28666977#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional survey was conducted with club administrators of community football clubs in the state of New South Wales,, Australia. Perceived usefulness,, ease of use and intention to use a hypothetical Web-based alcohol management support program was assessed using the validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) instrument. Associations between intention to use a Web-based program and club characteristics as well as perceived ease of use and usefulness was tested using Fisher's exact test and represented using relative risk (RR) for high intention to use the program.
34822341#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to get an overview of the research trends that use VR in neuropsychological tests and to analyze the research trends using fully immersive VR neuropsychological tests with experimental articles.

28666977#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 73 football clubs that were approached to participate in the study,, 63 consented to participate and 46 were eligible and completed the survey. All participants reported having access to the Web and 98% reported current use of electronic devices (eg,, computers,, iPads/tablets,, smartphones,, laptops,, televisions,, and smartboards). Mean scores (out of a possible 7) for the TAM constructs were high for intention to use (mean 6.25,, SD 0.87),, perceived ease of use (mean 6.00,, SD 0.99),, and perceived usefulness (mean 6.17,, SD 0.85). Intention to use the Web-based alcohol management program was significantly associated with perceived ease of use (P=.02,, RR 1.4,, CI 1.0-2.9),, perceived usefulness (P=.03,, RR 1.5,, CI 1.0-6.8) and club size (P=.02,, RR 0.8,, CI 0.5-0.9). The most useful features of such a program included the perceived ability to complete program requirements within users' own time,, complete program accreditation assessment and monitoring online,, develop tailored action plans,, and receive email reminders and prompts to complete action.
28666977#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A Web-based alcohol management approach to support sports clubs in the implementation of recommended alcohol management policies appears both feasible and acceptable. Future research should aim to determine if such intended use leads to actual use and club implementation of alcohol management policies.

34822341#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In neuropsychology,, fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has been spotlighted as a promising tool. It is considered that VR not only overcomes the existing limitation of neuropsychological tests but is also appropriate for treating executive functions (EFs) within activities of daily living (ADL) due to its high ecological validity. While fully immersive VR offers new possibilities of neuropsychological tests,, there are few studies that overview the intellectual landscape and academic trends in the research related to mainly targeted EFs with fully immersive VR.

34822341#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This review was carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles were searched in three web databases using keywords related to VR,, EFs,, and cognitive abilities. The study was conducted in two steps,, keyword analysis and in-depth systematic review. In the web database search from 2000 to 2019,, 1167 articles were initially collected,, of which 234 articles in the eligibility phase were used to conduct keyword analysis and a total of 47 articles were included for systematic review.
34822341#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In keyword analysis,, the number of articles focused on dementia including the keywords "MCI,," "SCD,," and "dementia" were highlighted over the period,, rather than other symptoms. In addition,, we identified that the use of behavioral and physiological data in virtual environments (VEs) has dramatically increased in recent studies. In the systematic review,, we focused on the purpose of study,, assessment,, treatment,, and validation of usability and structure. We found that treatment studies and uncategorized studies including presence and cybersickness issues have emerged in the recent period. In addition,, the target symptoms and range of participants were diversified.
34822341#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There has been a continuously increasing interest in dealing with neuropsychology by using fully immersive VR. Target cognitive abilities have been diversified,, as well as target symptoms. Moreover,, the concept of embodied cognition was transplanted in this research area.

28559227#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Design processes such as human-centered design (HCD),, which involve the end user throughout the product development and testing process,, can be crucial in ensuring that the product meets the needs and capabilities of the user,, particularly in terms of safety and user experience. The structured and iterative nature of HCD can often conflict with the necessary rapid product development life-cycles associated with the competitive connected health industry.
28559227#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to apply a structured HCD methodology to the development of a smartphone app that was to be used within a connected health fall risk detection system. Our methodology utilizes so called discount usability engineering techniques to minimize the burden on resources during development and maintain a rapid pace of development. This study will provide prospective designers a detailed description of the application of a HCD methodology.

28559227#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A 3-phase methodology was applied. In the first phase,, a descriptive "use case" was developed by the system designers and analyzed by both expert stakeholders and end users. The use case described the use of the app and how various actors would interact with it and in what context. A working app prototype and a user manual were then developed based on this feedback and were subjected to a rigorous usability inspection. Further changes were made both to the interface and support documentation. The now advanced prototype was exposed to user testing by end users where further design recommendations were made.
28559227#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#With combined expert and end-user analysis of a comprehensive use case having originally identified 21 problems with the system interface,, we have only seen and observed 3 of these problems in user testing,, implying that 18 problems were eliminated between phase 1 and 3. Satisfactory ratings were obtained during validation testing by both experts and end users,, and final testing by users shows the system requires low mental,, physical,, and temporal demands according to the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).
28559227#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#From our observation of older adults' interactions with smartphone interfaces,, there were some recurring themes. Clear and relevant feedback as the user attempts to complete a task is critical. Feedback should include pop-ups,, sound tones,, color or texture changes,, or icon changes to indicate that a function has been completed successfully,, such as for the connection sequence. For text feedback,, clear and unambiguous language should be used so as not to create anxiety,, particularly when it comes to saving data. Warning tones or symbols,, such as caution symbols or shrill tones,, should only be used if absolutely necessary. Our HCD methodology,, designed and implemented based on the principles of the International Standard Organizaton (ISO) 9241-210 standard,, produced a functional app interface within a short production cycle,, which is now suitable for use by older adults in long term clinical trials.

35353046#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#It has been suggested that Bayesian dosing apps can assist in the therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving vancomycin. Unfortunately,, Bayesian dosing tools are often unaffordable to resource-limited hospitals. Our aim was to improve vancomycin dosing in adults. We created a free and open-source dose adjustment app,, VancoCalc,, which uses Bayesian inference to aid clinicians in dosing and monitoring of vancomycin.

35353046#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The app build and model fitting process were described. Previously published pharmacokinetic models were used as priors. The ability of the app to predict vancomycin concentrations was performed using a small data set comprising of 52 patients,, aged 18 years and over,, who received at least 1 dose of intravenous vancomycin and had at least 2 vancomycin concentrations drawn between July 2018 and January 2021 at Lakeridge Health Corporation Ontario,, Canada. With these estimated and actual concentrations,, median prediction error (bias),, median absolute error (accuracy),, and root mean square error (precision) were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the Bayesian estimated pharmacokinetic parameters.
35353046#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 52 unique patients' initial vancomycin concentrations were used to predict subsequent concentration; 104 total vancomycin concentrations were assessed. The median prediction error was -0.600 ug/mL (IQR -3.06,, 2.95),, the median absolute error was 3.05 ug/mL (IQR 1.44,, 4.50),, and the root mean square error was 5.34.
35353046#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We described a free,, open-source Bayesian vancomycin dosing calculator based on revisions of currently available calculators. Based on this small retrospective preliminary sample of patients,, the app offers reasonable accuracy and bias,, which may be used in everyday practice. By offering this free,, open-source app,, further prospective validation could be implemented in the near future.

32815891#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE#Telephone-based assessment may be a valuable and cost-effective approach to improve monitoring and follow-up assessments in patients and research participants. Telephone-based assessment may be of particular value during times when it is important to reduce in-person contract,, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent validity of the telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND for the assessment of manual ability in individuals with stroke.
32815891#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using a cross-sectional study design,, participants with stroke were invited to answer the ABILHAND questionnaire on 2 randomized occasions,, face to face and by telephone,, 5 to 7 days apart. The mean difference (MD) between the interviews was calculated (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) to investigate the concurrent validity. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and weighted ? coefficients were used to investigate the agreement between face-to-face and telephone-based administration.
32815891#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#One hundred two participants (50 men; mean age = 65 years,, SD = 13 years) were included. No significant differences were observed between the mean scores obtained with face-to-face and telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND (MD = -0.06; 95% CI,, -0.72 to 0.60). Very high agreement was found between face-to-face and telephone-based administration (ICC = 0.90; 95% CI,, 0.85 to 0.93) on the ABILHAND total scores. Most of the individual items had moderate or substantial ? agreement.

36361147#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#This research aimed to develop a questionnaire to analyze perceived aspects of using digital technology among nursing students as a collaborative tool. We further sought to evaluate the psychometric reliability of the instrument.
36361147#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional observational study was performed using a questionnaire developed from scratch. Psychometric studies and univariate and bivariate analyses were performed.
36361147#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#132 nursing students participated. The exploratory and confirmatory analyses of the questionnaire excluded 4 of the initial 18 items and established four domains,, and internal consistency was found. The mean global score of the answers to the questionnaire was 4.67 on a scale of 1-5 points,, and all the domains obtained high scores. Men scored higher on the usefulness and the global score,, while no differences were found regarding age.
36361147#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Nursing students positively assess the use of digital technology as a collaborative tool,, regardless of age. Digital technology as a collaborative tool is perceived as beneficial,, improves their involvement,, and allows nursing students to obtain a better knowledge of their partners. These findings can help develop group projects and tools based on technology to train future nursing professionals. The questionnaire developed is a valid tool to assess this.

27096229#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Currently,, the diagnosis of prevalent diseases such as malaria,, tuberculosis,, or diarrheal diseases in rural areas of developing countries requires the displacement of the patient from their community health post to their reference health center or to ship a sample. This delays diagnosis and the treatment of disease.
27096229#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Conduct research to develop a new method for rapid low-cost diagnosis of prevalent diseases in rural areas of developing countries (malaria,, tuberculosis,, parasitic infections,, vaginal infections,, and cervical cancer).
27096229#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was divided into three phases. The first related to the drafting and validating of new protocols for the preparation of samples that should be adapted to be carried out in areas without power and with little trained personnel. The second phase consisted of developing a telemicroscopy system looking for low cost,, software compatibility,, and technical quality. Finally,, the third phase evaluated the system as a diagnostic tool using direct observation with a conventional microscope as the gold standard.
27096229#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The validation of the new protocols showed that 100% of the vaginal swabs were processed correctly when using direct smear,, while they were only 86.3% correct when using Gram stain; 68.3% of fecal samples were correctly processed using Kinyoun stain; 61.7% of blood samples when using thin film; and 83.8% when using thick film. Phase 2 permitted the development of a low-cost (<$250) and low-power (<15?W) telemicroscopy system that allows real-time consultation between health technicians and specialists. Finally,, phase 3 proved that there was no difference between the diagnostics obtained by direct observation in a microscope and those ones obtained through the new telemicroscopy system.
27096229#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study has verified the effectiveness of the telemicroscopy system as a diagnostic tool,, given the complete agreement between the diagnoses made with it and those made with the gold standard.

33327836#ABSTRACT##Objective: Diabetes is a prevalent and growing problem in the United States (U.S.); primary care physicians need to be prepared to initiate and progressively advance treatment. The objective of this study was to understand how diabetes management is taught in U.S. Family Medicine (FM) and Internal Medicine (IM) residency programs.Methods: Invitations to complete an online survey were sent via postal mail to U.S. FM and IM residency programs in 2019.Results: Directors/associate directors from 68 FM residencies and 66 IM residencies completed the online survey out of 645 (10.5%) and 505 (13.1%) programs,, respectively. Most respondents rated cardiovascular disease and risk management in diabetes as 'very important' (90%),, but only about half (47%) did so for newer generation insulin analogs and 27% for digital health technologies. About two-thirds of programs cover non-insulin options for type 2 diabetes (66%) and types of insulin (63%) to a great extent,, but only about one-third of programs cover social determinants of health (36%) and pre-diabetes (35%) to this degree. Many programs report plans to expand training on cardiovascular disease and diabetes (59%),, but only 32% plan to expand training on digital technology for diabetes care. Lack of faculty time and competing priorities are cited as being the biggest barriers to expanding diabetes training.Conclusions: Our study found that the current U.S. FM and IM residency program diabetes curricula are dominantly oriented toward cardiovascular disease and 'traditional' insulins. A variety of training materials and resources could help overcome some of the current barriers to curriculum expansion of other important components of diabetes care that may help future physicians successfully manage diabetes with newer generation insulin and glucose monitoring technologies.Abbreviations: U.S: United States; PCP: Primary Care Physician; FM: Family Medicine; IM: Internal Medicine; CGM: Continuous Glucose Monitor; AAFP: American Academy of Family Physicians; ACGME: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; U/mL: units per milliliter; CME: Continuing Medical Education.

34452892#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Routine monitoring of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the standard of care in diabetes mellitus (DM),, but adhering to regular laboratory appointments may be challenging when access to care is limited,, such as during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020.

34452892#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS#We evaluated trends in patient encounters and laboratory testing for DM in a pediatric healthcare system from March to September 2019 and during the same period in 2020.
34452892#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Evaluation of 17,,367 patient encounters illustrated that the pandemic was associated with significantly fewer in-person office visits and point-of-care HbA1c tests for patients with DM in 2020 relative to 2019. A separate analysis of 7,,193 HbA1c results measured by point-of-care testing in the general population found a significant increase in the number of measured HbA1c >14 % in May 2020 relative to 2019,, but other measured HbA1c values did not differ. As a means to address lapses in the monitoring of HbA1c due to the pandemic,, we evaluated the use of the dried blood spot (DBS) matrix for measurement of HbA1c by the Vitros 5600 chemistry analyzer. DBS HbA1c was well correlated to whole blood (r=0.9889) and exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision from 0.5-3.5%.
34452892#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#DBS measurement of HbA1c presents a viable alternative to routine in-person laboratory monitoring of DM.

21335890#ABSTRACT##Patients scheduled for surgery at the Omaha VA Medical Center were evaluated preoperatively via telemedicine. Following the examination,, patients filled out a 15 item,, 5 point Likert scale questionnaire regarding their opinion of preoperative evaluation in a VTC format. Evaluations were performed under the direction of nationally recognized guidelines and recommendations of experts in the field of perioperative medicine and were overseen by a staff anesthesiologist from the Omaha VA Medical Center. No significant difficulties were encountered by the patient or the evaluator regarding the quality of the audio/visual capabilities of the VTC link and its ability to facilitate preoperative evaluation. 87.5% of patients felt that virtual evaluation would save them travel time; 87.5% felt virtual evaluation could save them money; 7.3% felt uncomfortable using the VTC link; 12.2% felt the virtual evaluation took longer than expected; 70.7% preferred to be evaluated via VTC link; 21.9% were undecided; 9.7% felt they would rather be evaluated face-to-face with 26.8% undecided; 85.0% felt that teleconsultation was as good as being seen at the Omaha surgical evaluation unit; 7.5% were undecided. Our study has shown that effective preoperative evaluation can be performed using a virtual preoperative evaluation clinic; patients are receptive to the VTC format and,, in the majority of cases,, prefer it to face-to-face evaluation.
31465600#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although live and teledermoscopic examination has been successfully used to achieve non-invasive diagnosis of melanocytic skin lesions (MSLs),, early melanoma (EM) and atypical nevi (AN) continue to be a challenge,, and none of the various algorithms proposed have been sufficiently accurate. We designed a scoring classifier diagnostic method,, the iDScore that combines clinical data of the patient with dermoscopic features of the MSL.
31465600#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To test the accuracy of the iDScore in differentiating EM from AN in a teledermoscopy setting and to compare it with intuitive diagnosis,, the ABCD rule and the seven-point checklist.
31465600#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#A dedicated teledermoscopy web platform was designed. This involved the following: (i) collecting a large integrated clinical-historical-dermoscopic data set of difficult MSLs from eight European dermatology centres; (ii) online testing,, education and training in using the iDScore. A total of 904 images were combined with age,, sex,, lesion diameter and body site data and evaluated on the platform by 111 participants with four levels of skill in dermoscopy. Each testing session consisted of 30 blind cases to examine consecutively by the above four methods. 'Management decisions' and personal participant data were also recorded.
31465600#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#iDScore-aided diagnosis achieved satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for all lesions,, irrespective of centre of affiliation,, showing an average AUC of 0.776 in all participant testing sessions. All skill groups improved their accuracy by 10-16% with respect to intuitive diagnosis and the other methods,, showing high concordance and avoiding wrong management decisions.

33539312#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As the COVID-19 pandemic continues,, an initial risk-adapted allocation is crucial for managing medical resources and providing intensive care.
33539312#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we aimed to identify factors that predict the overall survival rate for COVID-19 cases and develop a COVID-19 prognosis score (COPS) system based on these factors. In addition,, disease severity and the length of hospital stay for patients with COVID-19 were analyzed.
33539312#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We retrospectively analyzed a nationwide cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between January and April 2020 in Korea. The cohort was split randomly into a development cohort and a validation cohort with a 2:1 ratio. In the development cohort (n=3729),, we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival and develop a scoring system to predict the overall survival rate by using parameters identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. In the validation cohort (n=1865),, we evaluated the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The score of each variable in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio.
33539312#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The newly developed predictive COPS system may assist in making risk-adapted decisions for the allocation of medical resources,, including intensive care,, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COPS system yielded an area under the curve value of 0.918 for predicting the 14-day survival rate and 0.896 for predicting the 28-day survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system,, 28-day survival rates were discriminatively estimated at 99.8%,, 95.4%,, 82.3%,, and 55.1% in the low-risk,, intermediate-risk,, high-risk,, and very high-risk groups,, respectively,, of the total cohort (P<.001). The length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with overall survival (P<.001),, and the hospital stay duration was significantly longer among survivors (mean 26.1,, SD 10.7 days) than among nonsurvivors (mean 15.6,, SD 13.3 days).

30248151#ABSTRACT#CONTEXT#The prevalence of skin diseases among prisoners is higher than in the general population. Diagnosing and treating these lesions require a dermatologic advice. A tele-expertise network in dermatology for prisoners including 8 health facilities in prison and 2 hospital dermatological departments was developed to improve access to dermatologists' expertise in correctional facilities. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of tele-expertise in dermatology for prisoners.
30248151#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We carried out a retrospective cohort study on data collected by the information system of the tele-expertise network. We used the MAST (Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine) model to perform a multidimensional assessment including the proportion of patients with a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions,, the proportion of technical problems,, the quality of the pictures,, the investment and operating costs and the satisfaction of the professionals.

30248151#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Mean patient age was 34.2 years with 90% men. 511 requests for 450 patients were initiated. The delay from the connection to the tele-expertise software to the validation of the request was inferior to 7 min for 50% of the requests and inferior to 30 min for 85% of the requests. Overall,, with tele-expertise,, 82% of the patients had a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions,, with 2.9% of all patients requiring a later face-to-face appointment or hospitalization,, to be compared to a proportion of 35% of patients with a completed treatment plan when tele-expertise was not available. The most frequent lesions were acnea (22%) and atopic dermatitis (18%). The mean cost for one completed treatment plan was €184 by tele-expertise and €315 without tele-expertise. Tele-expertise was well accepted among physicians with all responders (n = 9) willing to continue using it.
30248151#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Tele-expertise is a dominant intervention in comparison to a face-to face consultation taking into account the cost of transportation and the proportion of canceled appointments and is acceptable for physicians.

14692585#ABSTRACT##There is an increasing interest in assessing telemedicine as alternative method of delivering high quality cancer treatment to patients living in rural areas. In the Province of Trento (north-east Italy) a tele-oncology system was implemented to provide non-surgical oncological consultation to district general hospitals. The aim of this study was to explore user-satisfaction with the system after 6 months of experimentation. During the on-field validation two questionnaires with open and closed-response questions were distributed to 80 physicians and nurses 6 months apart to investigate the users' expected benefits vs. perceived ones. The two questionnaires were compared to assess how perceived benefits differed from expected ones. Significant differences were found regarding improvements in: the standardization of diagnostic-therapeutic procedures using the Electronic Patient Record (EPR)]; information sharing; data updating; consultation speed; and the possibility to diminish patients' travels through the use of teleconsultation (TC). Physicians' responses showed a significant difference regarding the EPR's effects on relationship with patient,, the nurses' responses with regards to its effects on care quality. Physicians felt that both modalities of teleconsultation were useful in enhancing communication with colleagues (86% for the synchronous TC,, 80% for the asynchronous TC). Responses indicated that the major difficulties encountered were in the introduction of the system into the daily routine. Despite this,, user expectations for its future use in clinical field were considerably high.

31438268#ABSTRACT##Self-reported anthropometric data in web-based weight loss interventions may be inaccurate. We studied the agreement between online self-reported and measured weight in the course of the POEmaS randomized controlled trial. Measured weight was not different from reported one (-0.4 kg; 95%CI -0.93 to 0.12). 95.6% of the cases were within the limits of agreement (Bland-Altman method). Self-reported weight collected online was accurate,, which suggests that interventions and outcomes assessment can rely on these data.

24035143#ABSTRACT##The chronically relapsing nature of alcoholism leads to substantial personal,, family,, and societal costs. Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week,, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service,, provided in A-CHESS,, to track patients' recovery progress. The model showed good predictability,, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation. The sensitivity/specificity table assists the tradeoff decisions necessary to apply the model in practice. This study moves us closer to the goal of providing lapse prediction so that patients might receive more targeted and timely support.

34805387#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Expansion in smartphone use and mobile health (mHealth) apps has generated a large and unregulated sector. Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD) is a widely prevalent disease in the UK. The aim of this study is to evaluate the smartphone apps focused on GORD,, available on major digital platforms,, with particular emphasis on their recorded evidence base (EB) and the extent of medical professional involvement (MPI) in their constitution.
34805387#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Relevant apps were extracted using defined search terms and inclusion (using a wide array of search terms) and exclusion criteria (non-English language,, duplicates) were applied. Data was collected from the overview provided by the developer in the app store and from the developer website for each app,, and classified according to various variables. EB and professional involvement data was obtained from the application details provided in the app stores as well as information section of individual apps.
34805387#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A vast majority of the apps (97.3%) were developed targeting the general public. Of the 73 apps,, 11 (15.1%) had a documented EB. Two apps stated if healthcare professionals were involved in the development,, screening or assessment of the app content,, meaning only 2.73% of the apps (2/73) stated their content had been contributed by medical professionals (individual,, group or organisation of health providers). Thirty-four apps had recent updates in 2019 (47%,, 34/73).
34805387#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Regulation and accreditation of mHealth apps related to GORD are needed.

33170109#ABSTRACT##Background: Clinical studies of telemedicine (TM) programs for chronic illness have demonstrated mixed results across settings and populations. With recent uptake in use of digital health modalities,, more precise patient classification may improve outcomes,, efficiency,, and effectiveness. Objective: The purpose of the research was to develop a predictive score that measures the influence of patient characteristics on TM interventions. The central hypothesis is that disease type,, illness severity,, and the social determinants of health influence outcomes,, including resource utilization,, and can be precisely characterized. Methods: The retrospective study evaluated the feasibility of creating a patient "Telemedicine ImPact" (TIP) score derived from a Virginia Medicare and Medicaid claims data set. Claims were randomly selected,, stratified by disease type,, and matched by illness severity into a TM intervention group (N?=?7,,782) and a nontelemedicine "usual care" control cohort (N?=?7,,981). The individual records were then summarized into 15,,762 cases with 80% of the cases used to develop,, train,, and test four predictive models (hospital utilization,, readmissions,, total utilization,, and mortality) using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Bayesian supervised machine learning achieved reference model performance index area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic (AUC/ROC) =0.85. Posterior probabilities for each outcome model were generated on a "hold-back" set of 3,,082 cases. Robust parametric statistical methods enabled dimension reduction,, model validation,, and derivation of a reliable composite scaled score that quantified the overall health risk for each case. The TM intervention cohort demonstrated higher total utilization (representing the sum of inpatient,, outpatient,, and prescription use) and lower mean inpatient utilization than the usual standard of care. This finding suggests TM-based care may shift the composition of health resource utilization,, reducing hospitalizations while increasing outpatient services,, adjusted for patient differences. Conclusions: The creation of a patient score using machine learning to predict the effect of TM on outcomes is feasible. Adoption of the TIP score may reduce variability in results by more precisely accounting for the effects of patient characteristics on health outcomes and utilization. More consistent outcome prediction may lead to greater support for digital health.
37213773#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Family members are important sources of support for patients with cancer. They access,, evaluate,, and engage with online information and discuss it with a cancer clinician. This study validates the 4-dimensions,, 18-item Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument (TeHLI) and proposed to include Clinical eHealth Literacy as a 5th dimension.
37213773#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) disseminated an online survey to 121 family member caregivers between March-June 2020. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses (1) to examine model fit for the 4-factor TeHLI in the cancer caregiver population,, and (2) to examine the model fit when adding the 5th factor.
37213773#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The 4-dimension model yielded acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.09; 90% CI = 0.08-0.11; CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.07). The 5-dimension model also yielded acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.08; 90% CI = 0.07-0.10; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.97; SRMR = 0.08),, supporting the expansion of the TeHLI within this population.
37213773#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The five-dimension TeHLI is a valid and reliable measure of eHealth literacy among blood cancer caregiver populations.
37213773#ABSTRACT#INNOVATION#The TeHLI can be used as an outcome measure for communication skills training for caregivers,, patients,, and clinicians.

36881540#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Vocal biomarker-based machine learning approaches have shown promising results in the detection of various health conditions,, including respiratory diseases,, such as asthma.
36881540#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to determine whether a respiratory-responsive vocal biomarker (RRVB) model platform initially trained on an asthma and healthy volunteer (HV) data set can differentiate patients with active COVID-19 infection from asymptomatic HVs by assessing its sensitivity,, specificity,, and odds ratio (OR).
36881540#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The ability of the RRVB model to differentiate patients with respiratory conditions from healthy controls was previously demonstrated on validation data in asthma,, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,, interstitial lung disease,, and cough,, with ORs of 4.3,, 9.1,, 3.1,, and 3.9,, respectively. The same RRVB model in this study in COVID-19 performed with a sensitivity of 73.2%,, specificity of 62.9%,, and OR of 4.64 (P<.001). Patients who experienced respiratory symptoms were detected more frequently than those who did not experience respiratory symptoms and completely asymptomatic patients (sensitivity: 78.4% vs 67.4% vs 68%,, respectively).

36881540#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A logistic regression model using a weighted sum of voice acoustic features was previously trained and validated on a data set of approximately 1700 patients with a confirmed asthma diagnosis and a similar number of healthy controls. The same model has shown generalizability to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,, interstitial lung disease,, and cough. In this study,, 497 participants (female: n=268,, 53.9%; <65 years old: n=467,, 94%; Marathi speakers: n=253,, 50.9%; English speakers: n=223,, 44.9%; Spanish speakers: n=25,, 5%) were enrolled across 4 clinical sites in the United States and India and provided voice samples and symptom reports on their personal smartphones. The participants included patients who are symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative as well as asymptomatic HVs. The RRVB model performance was assessed by comparing it with the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
36881540#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The RRVB model has shown good generalizability across respiratory conditions,, geographies,, and languages. Results using data set of patients with COVID-19 demonstrate its meaningful potential to serve as a prescreening tool for identifying individuals at risk for COVID-19 infection in combination with temperature and symptom reports. Although not a COVID-19 test,, these results suggest that the RRVB model can encourage targeted testing. Moreover,, the generalizability of this model for detecting respiratory symptoms across different linguistic and geographic contexts suggests a potential path for the development and validation of voice-based tools for broader disease surveillance and monitoring applications in the future.

30273709#ABSTRACT##Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) has evolved from a guideline by using the best approach to integrated care pathways using mobile technology in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma multimorbidity. The proposed next phase of ARIA is change management,, with the aim of providing an active and healthy life to patients with rhinitis and to those with asthma multimorbidity across the lifecycle irrespective of their sex or socioeconomic status to reduce health and social inequities incurred by the disease. ARIA has followed the 8-step model of Kotter to assess and implement the effect of rhinitis on asthma multimorbidity and to propose multimorbid guidelines. A second change management strategy is proposed by ARIA Phase 4 to increase self-medication and shared decision making in rhinitis and asthma multimorbidity. An innovation of ARIA has been the development and validation of information technology evidence-based tools (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network [MASK]) that can inform patient decisions on the basis of a self-care plan proposed by the health care professional.
26888196#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become one of the main pathways to the new paradigm of increased self-management of chronic conditions such as alcohol dependence. Validation of some mobile phone apps has begun,, while validation of many others is forthcoming.
26888196#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To describe the protocol for validation of a new app called SIDEAL (an acronym of the Spanish name "Soporte Innovador a la persona con DEpendencia del ALcohol,," or innovative support for people with alcohol dependence).
26888196#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The project consists of 3 complementary,, consecutive studies,, including a pilot feasibility study,, a qualitative study using focus groups,, and,, finally,, a randomized controlled trial where patients will be randomized to standard treatment or standard treatment plus SIDEAL. During the pilot study,, feasibility,, usability,, and acceptance by users will be the main outcomes explored. An electronic questionnaire will be sent to patients asking for their opinions. Focus groups will be the next step,, after which improvements and refinements will be implemented in the app. During the final phase,, consumption variables (heavy drinking days per month,, mean standard drinks per day) will be investigated,, in order to test app efficacy.
26888196#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Because of the encouraging results with previous similar apps,, we expect patients to widely accept and incorporate SIDEAL into their therapeutic options. Significant reductions in drinking-related variables are also expected. The pilot study has concluded with the inclusion of 29 patients. Results are expected to be available soon (expected mid-2016).

30540838#ABSTRACT##Heterogeneous mobile authentication is a crucial technique to securely retrieve the resource of e-healthcare cloud servers which are commonly implemented in a public key Infrastructure (PKI). Conventionally,, a mobile data user can utilize a self-chosen password along with a portable device to request the access privilege of clouds. However,, to validate the membership of users,, a cloud server usually has to make use of a password table,, which not only increases the burden of management,, but also raises the possibility of information leakage. In this paper,, we propose a secure heterogeneous mobile authentication and key agreement scheme for e-healthcare cloud systems. In our system structure,, an e-healthcare cloud server of traditional PKIs does not have to store a password table. A legitimate data user only possesses a security token hardware and keeps an offline updatable password without using any private key. Our scheme is classified into the category of dynamic ID authentication techniques,, since a data user is able to preserve his/her anonymity during authentication processes. We formally prove that the proposed mechanism fulfills the essential authenticated key exchange (AKE) security and owns lower computational costs. To further ensure the practical application security,, an automatic security validation tool called AVISPA is also adopted to analyze possible attacks and pitfalls of our designed protocol.

30531434#ABSTRACT#RECENT FINDINGS#Numbers of publications on big data and artificial intelligence in the field of urolithiasis are rising,, but still low. Most publications describe the development,, testing,, and validation of automated computational analyses of clinical data sets and/or images in a preclinical setting.
30531434#ABSTRACT#SUMMARY#In the field of digital health services,, there is a discrepancy between the enormous commitment of large private companies and investments of public funds. This situation means a still small number of medical publications on this topic in the urolithiasis field. Nevertheless,, as doctors and scientists,, we should try to provide our patients with secure and worthwhile digital services.

18430039#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The aim of this study was to evaluate the visual acuity scores of a computer-based visual function testing (CVFT) system. The automated chart uses logMAR notation (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) and randomised tilting E as optotype. The test was conducted using a laptop computer.
18430039#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This prospective,, clinic-based,, test validation study was based on a model of repeatability in two observations. The right eyes of a total of 104 participants were randomly tested with both CVFT and the manual,, gold standard Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart.
18430039#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The mean difference between CVFT and ETDRS was -0.01+/-0.11 (SD) logMAR units. The Spearman Rank correlation coefficient (r) between the absolute difference and the average was 0.35. The average time for testing one eye was 54.7+/-11.89 seconds. The mean difference between two consecutive,, repeated CVFT tests in the same eye was 0.02+/-0.07 logMAR units (paired t-test p=0.046).
18430039#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A novel,, automated visual acuity testing application is reported. This automated system should be a useful tool for mass screening of visual impairment in rural and remote regions with its ease of use and shorter testing time.

36409468#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Under the paradigm of precision medicine (PM),, patients with the same disease can receive different personalized therapies according to their clinical and genetic features. These therapies are determined by the totality of all available clinical evidence,, including results from case reports,, clinical trials,, and systematic reviews. However,, it is increasingly difficult for physicians to find such evidence from scientific publications,, whose size is growing at an unprecedented pace.
36409468#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this work,, we propose the PM-Search system to facilitate the retrieval of clinical literature that contains critical evidence for or against giving specific therapies to certain cancer patients.
36409468#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The PM-Search system combines a baseline retriever that selects document candidates at a large scale and an evidence reranker that finely reorders the candidates based on their evidence quality. The baseline retriever uses query expansion and keyword matching with the ElasticSearch retrieval engine,, and the evidence reranker fits pretrained language models to expert annotations that are derived from an active learning strategy.
36409468#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The PM-Search system achieved the best performance in the retrieval of high-quality clinical evidence at the Text Retrieval Conference PM Track 2020,, outperforming the second-ranking systems by large margins (0.4780 vs 0.4238 for standard normalized discounted cumulative gain at rank 30 and 0.4519 vs 0.4193 for exponential normalized discounted cumulative gain at rank 30).
36409468#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We present PM-Search,, a state-of-the-art search engine to assist the practicing of evidence-based PM. PM-Search uses a novel Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining-based active learning strategy that models evidence quality and improves the model performance. Our analyses show that evidence quality is a distinct aspect from general relevance,, and specific modeling of evidence quality beyond general relevance is required for a PM search engine.

36833678#ABSTRACT##Women with breast cancer are keen to know their predicted survival. We developed a new prognostic model for women with breast cancer in Malaysia. Using the model,, this study aimed to design the user interface and develop the contents of a web-based prognostic tool for the care provider to convey survival estimates. We employed an iterative website development process which includes: (1) an initial development stage informed by reviewing existing tools and deliberation among breast surgeons and epidemiologists,, (2) content validation and feedback by medical specialists,, and (3) face validation and end-user feedback among medical officers. Several iterative prototypes were produced and improved based on the feedback. The experts (n = 8) highly agreed on the website content and predictors for survival with content validity indices = 0.88. Users (n = 20) scored face validity indices of more than 0.90. They expressed favourable responses. The tool,, named Malaysian Breast cancer Survival prognostic Tool (myBeST),, is accessible online. The tool estimates an individualised five-year survival prediction probability. Accompanying contents were included to explain the tool's aim,, target user,, and development process. The tool could act as an additional tool to provide evidence-based and personalised breast cancer outcomes.

32281942#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The usual diagnosis of sarcopenia requires a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exam,, which has low accessibility in primary care for Latin American countries.
32281942#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to design and validate software for mobile devices (Android,, IOS) and computers,, based on an adapted version of the diagnostic algorithm of sarcopenia proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP).
32281942#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Follow-up exams were conducted on 430 community-dwelling Chileans 60 years and older (mean 68.2 years,, SD 4.9) participating in the IsaMayor and Alexandros cohorts designed to study sarcopenia and disability associated with obesity,, respectively. All the participants from the cohorts were randomly selected from the registries of primary health care centers and,, for this study,, must have a DXA scan at baseline. The software (HTSMayor) was designed according to an adapted version of the algorithm proposed by the EWGSOP and was divided into four phases: longitudinal validation of diagnostic algorithm of sarcopenia,, alpha version,, beta version,, and release version. The software estimates appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) using an anthropometric equation or DXA measurements with Chilean cut-off points. The predictive validation of the algorithm was estimated,, comparing functional limitations (at least one activity of daily living,, two instrumental activities of daily living,, or three mobility limitations),, falls,, and osteoporosis at follow-ups in patients with and without sarcopenia at baseline,, using adjusted logistic models.
32281942#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We developed and validated a software for the diagnosis of sarcopenia in older Chilean adults that can be used on a mobile device or a computer with good sensitivity and specificity,, thus allowing for the development of programs for the prevention,, delay,, or reversal of this disease. To our knowledge,, HTSMayor is the first software to diagnose sarcopenia.

32281942#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (2078.4 person-years),, 37 (9.9%) new cases of sarcopenia,, out of the 374 patients without sarcopenia at baseline,, were identified (incidence density rate=1.78 per 100 person-years). ASM estimated with the anthropometric equation showed both a high sensitivity and specificity as compared with those estimated by DXA measurements,, yielding a concordance of 0.96. The diagnostic algorithm of sarcopenia considered in the software with the equation showed both a high sensitivity (82.1%) and specificity (94.9%) when compared with DXA (reference standard). Adults without sarcopenia (at baseline) showed better physical performance (after approximately 5 years) than adults with sarcopenia. Loss of functionality was greater in adults with sarcopenia (OR 5.0,, 95% CI 2.2-11.4) than in adults without sarcopenia. In addition,, the risks of falls (OR 2.2,, 95% CI 1.1-4.3) and osteoporosis (OR 2.8,, 95% CI 1.2-6.6) were higher in older persons with sarcopenia than those without sarcopenia. The measurements and results were completed for the beta and release tests with a mean time of 10 minutes and 11 minutes,, respectively.
32004436#ABSTRACT##Background: Historically,, fewer than half of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) with diabetes received the annual diabetic retinopathy (DR) examination that is considered the minimum standard of care; this rate is similar to that of the general United States (U.S.) population with diabetes. Solution: The Indian Health Service-Joslin Vision Network (IHS-JVN) Teleophthalmology Program in 2000 to increase compliance with DR standards of care among AI/AN through validated,, primary care-based telemedicine. The IHS-JVN provides remote diagnosis of DR severity,, with a report including management recommendations that is returned to the patient's primary care provider. The program conforms with the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) Practice Guidelines for Ocular Telehealth-Diabetic Retinopathy. Outcomes: The IHS-JVN has been expanding incrementally since the first patients were recruited in 2000; this expansion coincides with large improvements in the annual DR examination rates reported as part of local,, regional,, and national regulatory compliance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Currently,, with 99 clinical implementations in 23 states,, IHS-JVN is the largest primary care-based ATA validation category three telemedicine program in the U.S. Summary: This article describes the program's workflow,, imaging and reading technologies,, diagnostic protocols,, reports to providers,, training,, quality assurance processes,, and geographical distribution. In addition to its clinical use,, the program has been utilized in research on utilization of diabetic eye care,, cost-effectiveness,, technology development,, and DR epidemiology of the AI/AN population. Potential next steps for this program are discussed.

35089152#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Monitoring social media has been shown to be a useful means to capture patients' opinions and feelings about medical issues,, ranging from diseases to treatments. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a useful indicator of overall patients' health,, which can be captured online.
35089152#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to describe a social media listening algorithm able to detect the impact of diseases or treatments on specific dimensions of HRQoL based on posts written by patients in social media and forums.
35089152#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using a web crawler,, 19 forums in France were harvested,, and messages related to patients' experience with disease or treatment were specifically collected. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) and EQ-5D (Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions) HRQoL surveys were mixed and adapted for a tailored social media listening system. This was carried out to better capture the variety of expression on social media,, resulting in 5 dimensions of the HRQoL,, which are physical,, psychological,, activity-based,, social,, and financial. Models were trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Oversampling was used to increase the infrequent dimension: after annotation,, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) was used to balance the proportions of the dimensions among messages.
35089152#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The training set was composed of 1399 messages,, randomly taken from a batch of 20,,000 health-related messages coming from forums. The algorithm was able to detect a general impact on HRQoL (sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.74),, a physical impact (0.67 and 0.76),, a psychic impact (0.82 and 0.60),, an activity-related impact (0.73 and 0.78),, a relational impact (0.73 and 0.70),, and a financial impact (0.79 and 0.74).
35089152#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The development of an innovative method to extract health data from social media as real time assessment of patients' HRQoL is useful to a patient-centered medical care. As a source of real-world data,, social media provide a complementary point of view to understand patients' concerns and unmet needs,, as well as shedding light on how diseases and treatments can be a burden in their daily lives.

29074470#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent mental health issue among veterans. Access to PTSD treatment is influenced by geographic (ie,, travel distance to facilities),, temporal (ie,, time delay between services),, financial (ie,, eligibility and cost of services),, and cultural (ie,, social stigma) barriers.
29074470#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The emergence of mobile health (mHealth) apps has the potential to bridge many of these access gaps by providing remote resources and monitoring that can offer discrete assistance to trauma survivors with PTSD and enhance patient-clinician relationships. In this study,, we investigate the current mHealth capabilities relevant to PTSD.
29074470#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study consists of two parts: (1) a review of publicly available PTSD apps designed to determine the availability of PTSD apps,, which includes more detailed information about three dominant apps and (2) a scoping literature review performed using a systematic method to determine app usage and efforts toward validation of such mHealth apps. App usage relates to how the end users (eg,, clinicians and patients) are interacting with the app,, whereas validation is testing performed to ensure the app's purpose and specifications are met.
29074470#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results suggest that though numerous apps have been developed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD symptoms,, few apps were designed to be integrated with clinical PTSD treatment,, and minimal efforts have been made toward enhancing the usability and validation of PTSD apps.
29074470#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These findings expose the need for studies relating to the human factors evaluation of such tools,, with the ultimate goal of increasing access to treatment and widening the app adoption rate for patients with PTSD.

36833900#ABSTRACT##(1) Background: In the "post-COVID-19 era",, there is a need to focus on properly assessing and addressing the extent of its well-established mental health collateral damage. The "Electronic Mental Wellness Tool" (E-mwTool) is a 13-item validated stepped-care or stratified management instrument that aims at the high-sensitivity captures of individuals with mental health disorders to determine the need for mental health care. This study validated the E-mwTool in a Spanish-speaking population. (2) Methods: It is a cross-sectional validation study using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview as a criterion standard in a sample of 433 participants. (3) Results: About 72% of the sample had a psychiatric disorder,, and 67% had a common mental disorder. Severe mental disorders,, alcohol use disorders,, substance use disorders,, and suicide risk had a much lower prevalence rate (6.7%,, 6.2%,, 3.2%,, and 6.2%,, respectively). The first three items performed excellently in identifying any mental health disorder with 0.97 sensitivity. Ten additional items classified participants with common mental disorders,, severe mental disorders,, substance use disorders,, and suicide risk. (4) Conclusions: The E-mwTool had high sensitivity in identifying common mental disorders,, alcohol and substance use disorders,, and suicidal risk. However,, the tool's sensitivity in detecting low-prevalence disorders in the sample was low. This Spanish version may be useful to detect patients at risk of mental health burden at the front line of primary and secondary care in facilitating help-seeking and referral by their physicians.

36265042#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The COVID-19 disease has multiple symptoms,, with anosmia and ageusia being the most prevalent,, varying from 75% to 95% and from 50% to 80% of infected patients,, respectively. An automatic assessment tool for these symptoms will help monitor the disease in a fast and noninvasive manner.
36265042#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We hypothesized that people with COVID-19 experiencing anosmia and ageusia had different voice features than those without such symptoms. Our objective was to develop an artificial intelligence pipeline to identify and internally validate a vocal biomarker of these symptoms for remotely monitoring them.
36265042#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study used population-based data. Participants were assessed daily through a web-based questionnaire and asked to register 2 different types of voice recordings. They were adults (aged >18 years) who were confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction test to be positive for COVID-19 in Luxembourg and met the inclusion criteria. Statistical methods such as recursive feature elimination for dimensionality reduction,, multiple statistical learning methods,, and hypothesis tests were used throughout this study. The TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) Prediction Model Development checklist was used to structure the research.
36265042#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This study included 259 participants. Younger (aged <35 years) and female participants showed higher rates of ageusia and anosmia. Participants were aged 41 (SD 13) years on average,, and the data set was balanced for sex (female: 134/259,, 51.7%; male: 125/259,, 48.3%). The analyzed symptom was present in 94 (36.3%) out of 259 participants and in 450 (27.5%) out of 1636 audio recordings. In all,, 2 machine learning models were built,, one for Android and one for iOS devices,, and both had high accuracy-88% for Android and 85% for iOS. The final biomarker was then calculated using these models and internally validated.
36265042#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study demonstrates that people with COVID-19 who have anosmia and ageusia have different voice features from those without these symptoms. Upon further validation,, these vocal biomarkers could be nested in digital devices to improve symptom assessment in clinical practice and enhance the telemonitoring of COVID-19-related symptoms.

32195372#ABSTRACT##This manuscript is focused on the use of connected sensor technologies,, including wearables and other biosensors,, for a wide range of health services,, such as collecting digital endpoints in clinical trials and remotely monitoring patients in clinical care. The adoption of these technologies poses five risks that currently exceed our abilities to evaluate and secure these products: (1) validation,, (2) security practices,, (3) data rights and governance,, (4) utility and usability; and (5) economic feasibility. In this manuscript we conduct a landscape analysis of emerging evaluation frameworks developed to better manage these risks,, broadly in digital health. We then propose a framework specifically for connected sensor technologies. We provide a pragmatic guide for how to put this evaluation framework into practice,, taking lessons from concepts in drug and nutrition labels to craft a connected sensor technology label.
35357312#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#People with diabetes and their support networks have developed open-source automated insulin delivery systems to help manage their diabetes therapy,, as well as to improve their quality of life and glycemic outcomes. Under the hashtag #WeAreNotWaiting,, a wealth of knowledge and real-world data have been generated by users of these systems but have been left largely untapped by research; opportunities for such multimodal studies remain open.
35357312#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of several aspects of open-source automated insulin delivery systems including challenges related to data management and security across multiple disparate web-based platforms and challenges related to implementing follow-up studies.
35357312#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed a mixed methods study to collect questionnaire responses and anonymized diabetes data donated by participants-which included adults and children with diabetes and their partners or caregivers recruited through multiple diabetes online communities. We managed both front-end participant interactions and back-end data management with our web portal (called the Gateway). Participant questionnaire data from electronic data capture (REDCap) and personal device data aggregation (Open Humans) platforms were pseudonymously and securely linked and stored within a custom-built database that used both open-source and commercial software. Participants were later given the option to include their health care providers in the study to validate their questionnaire responses; the database architecture was designed specifically with this kind of extensibility in mind.
35357312#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of 1052 visitors to the study landing page,, 930 participated and completed at least one questionnaire. After the implementation of health care professional validation of self-reported clinical outcomes to the study,, an additional 164 individuals visited the landing page,, with 142 completing at least one questionnaire. Of the optional study elements,, 7 participant-health care professional dyads participated in the survey,, and 97 participants who completed the survey donated their anonymized medical device data.
35357312#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The platform was accessible to participants while maintaining compliance with data regulations. The Gateway formalized a system of automated data matching between multiple data sets,, which was a major benefit to researchers. Scalability of the platform was demonstrated with the later addition of self-reported data validation. This study demonstrated the feasibility of custom software solutions in addressing complex study designs. The Gateway portal code has been made available open-source and can be leveraged by other research groups.

36922957#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Social determinants of health significantly affect health outcomes,, yet are infrequently addressed in prenatal care.
36922957#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to improve the efficiency and experience of addressing social needs in pregnancy through: (1) testing a digital short-form screening tool; and (2) characterizing pregnant people's preferences for social needs screening and management.
36922957#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#We developed a digital short-form social determinants of health screening tool from PRAPARE (Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets,, Risks,, and Experiences),, and a survey to query patients' preferences for addressing social needs. Instruments were administered online to peripartum participants,, with equal representation of patients with public and private insurance. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the short-form tool vs PRAPARE. Quantitative responses were characterized using descriptive statistics. Free-text responses were analyzed with matrix and thematic coding. Survey data were analyzed by subgroups of historically marginalized populations.
36922957#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 215 people completed the survey. Participants were predominantly White (167; 77.7%) and multiparous (145; 67.4%). Unmet social needs were prevalent with both the short-form tool (77.7%) and PRAPARE (96.7%). The sensitivity (79.3%) and specificity (71.4%) of the short-form screener were high for detecting any social need. Most participants believed that it was important for their pregnancy care team to know their social needs (material: 173,, 80.5%; support: 200,, 93.0%),, and over half felt comfortable sharing their needs through in-person or digital modalities if assistance was or was not available (material: 117,, 54.4%; support: 122,, 56.7%). Free-text themes reflected considerations for integrating social needs in routine prenatal care. Acceptability of addressing social needs in pregnancy was high among all groups.
36922957#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A digital short-form social determinants of health screening tool performs well when compared with the gold standard. Pregnant people accept social needs as a part of routine pregnancy care. Future work is needed to operationalize efficient,, effective,, patient-centered approaches to addressing social needs in pregnancy.

37335610#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Achieving the target for eliminating tuberculosis (TB) in India by 2025,, 5 years ahead of the global target,, critically depends on strengthening the capacity of human resources as one of the key components of the health system. Due to the rapid updates of standards and protocols,, the human resources for TB health care suffer from a lack of understanding of recent updates and acquiring necessary knowledge.
37335610#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Despite an increasing focus on the digital revolution in health care,, there is no such platform available to deliver the key updates in national TB control programs with easy access. Thus,, the aim of this study was to explore the development and evolution of a mobile health tool for capacity building of the Indian health system's workforce to better manage patients with TB.
37335610#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This study involved two phases. The first phase was based on a qualitative investigation,, including personal interviews to understand the basic requirements of staff working in the management of patients with TB,, followed by participatory consultative meetings with stakeholders to validate and develop the content for the mobile health app. Qualitative information was collected from the Purbi Singhbhum and Ranchi districts of Jharkhand and Gandhinagar,, and from the Surat districts of Gujarat State. In the second phase,, a participatory design process was undertaken as part of the content creation and validation exercises.
37335610#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The first phase collected information from 126 health care staff,, with a mean age of 38.4 (SD 8.9) years and average work experience of 8.9 years. The assessment revealed that more than two-thirds of participants needed further training and lacked knowledge of the most current updates to TB program guidelines. The consultative process determined the need for a digital solution in easily accessible formats and ready reckoner content to deliver practical solutions to address operational issues for implementation of the program. Ultimately,, the digital platform named Ni-kshay SETU (Support to End Tuberculosis) was developed to support the knowledge enhancement of health care workers.

33325828#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a common metric used to assess the usability of a system,, and it was initially developed in English. The implementation of electronic systems for clinical counseling (eHealth and mobile health) is increasing worldwide. Therefore,, tools are needed to evaluate these applications in the languages and regional contexts in which the electronic tools are developed.
33325828#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to translate,, culturally adapt,, and validate the original English version of the SUS into a Spanish version.
33325828#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The translation process included forward and backward translation. Forward translations were made by 2 native Spanish speakers who spoke English as their second language,, and a backward translation was made by a native English speaker. The Spanish SUS questionnaire was validated by 10 experts in mobile app development. The face validity of the questionnaire was tested with 10 mobile phone users,, and the reliability testing was conducted among 88 electronic application users.

30340488#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Online health information is unregulated and can be of highly variable quality. There is currently no singular quantitative tool that has undergone a validation process,, can be used for a broad range of health information,, and strikes a balance between ease of use,, concision and comprehensiveness. To address this gap,, we developed the QUality Evaluation Scoring Tool (QUEST). Here we report on the analysis of the reliability and validity of the QUEST in assessing the quality of online health information.
30340488#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The QUEST and three existing tools designed to measure the quality of online health information were applied to two randomized samples of articles containing information about the treatment (n?=?16) and prevention (n?=?29) of Alzheimer disease as a sample health condition. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using a weighted Cohen's kappa (?) for each item of the QUEST. To compare the quality scores generated by each pair of tools,, convergent validity was measured using Kendall's tau (t) ranked correlation.
30340488#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The QUEST demonstrated high levels of inter-rater reliability for the seven quality items included in the tool (? ranging from 0.7387 to 1.0,, P?<?.05). The tool was also found to demonstrate high convergent validity. For both treatment- and prevention-related articles,, all six pairs of tests exhibited a strong correlation between the tools (t ranging from 0.41 to 0.65,, P?<?.05).
30340488#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our findings support the QUEST as a reliable and valid tool to evaluate online articles about health. Results provide evidence that the QUEST integrates the strengths of existing tools and evaluates quality with equal efficacy using a concise,, seven-item questionnaire. The QUEST can serve as a rapid,, effective,, and accessible method of appraising the quality of online health information for researchers and clinicians alike.

30914488#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Using telehealth in pulmonary rehabilitation (telerehabilitation) is a new field of health-care practice. To successfully implement a telerehabilitation program,, measures of acceptance of this new type of program need to be assessed among potential users. The purpose of this study was to develop a scale to measure acceptance of using telerehabilitation by health-care practitioners and patients.
30914488#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Three objectives were met (a) constructing a modified scale of the technology acceptance model,, (b) judging the items for content validity,, and (c) judging the scale for face validity. Nine experts agreed to participate and evaluate item relevance to theoretical definitions of domains. To establish face validity,, 7 health-care practitioners and 5 patients were interviewed to provide feedback about the scale's clarity and ease of reading.
30914488#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The final items were divided into 2 scales that reflected the health-care practitioner and patient responses. Each scale included 3 subscales: perceived usefulness,, perceived ease of use,, and behavioral intention.
30914488#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The 2 scales,, each with 3 subscales,, exhibited evidence of content validity and face validity. The 17-item telerehabilitation acceptance scale for health-care practitioners and the 13-item telerehabilitation acceptance scale among patients warrant further psychometric testing as valuable measures for pulmonary rehabilitation programs.

34058641#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#When it comes to critical early post-acute TIA/stroke phase,, there is a lack of a comprehensive multi-parametric telemonitoring system. The COVID-19 emergency,, its related global mobility restrictions and fear of hospitalization further highlighted the need of a comprehensive solution.
34058641#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to design and test a pragmatic e-Health system based on multiparametric telemonitoring to support of TIA/stroke patients in sub-acute phase during the COVID-19 pandemic.
34058641#ABSTRACT#METHODS#/temperature sensing,, panic-button,, gateway,, and a dedicated ICT platform. The protocol is a 14-day multiparametric telemonitoring,, therapy,, and emergency intervention based on vital sign alteration notifications. We conducted a proof-of-concept validation test on 8 TIA/minor stroke patients in the early post-acute phase (< 14 days from ischemic event).
34058641#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The proposed solution allowed to promptly and remotely identify vital sign alterations at home during the early post-acute phase,, allowing therapy and behavioral intervention adjustments. Also,, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life,, as well as a significant reduction of anxiety and depression status. TUQ showed ease of use,, good interface quality and high user satisfaction of the proposed solution. The 3-month follow-up showed total adherence of prescribed therapy and no stroke/TIA recurrence or other emergency department admissions.
34058641#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The proposed e-Health solution and telemonitoring protocol may be highly useful for early post-acute remote patient management,, thus supporting constant monitoring and patient adherence to the treatment pathway,, especially during the COVID-19 emergency.

28251444#ABSTRACT##Research on body-worn sensors has shown how they can be used for the detection of falls in the elderly,, which is a relevant health problem. However,, most systems are trained with simulated falls,, which differ from those of the target population. In this paper,, we tackle the problem of fall detection using a combination of novelty detectors. A novelty detector can be trained only with activities of daily life (ADL),, which are true movements recorded in real life. In addition,, they allow adapting the system to new users,, by recording new movements and retraining the system. The combination of several detectors and features enhances performance. The proposed approach has been compared with a traditional supervised algorithm,, a support vector machine,, which is trained with both falls and ADL. The combination of novelty detectors shows better performance in a typical cross-validation test and in an experiment that mimics the effect of personalizing the classifiers. The results indicate that it is possible to build a reliable fall detector based only on ADL.

31397298#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#A great number of weight loss interventions have been delivered through digital solutions. Analysis of the effectiveness in terms of weight loss is fundamental to understand the real potential of digital technologies as tools for delivery of weight loss interventions. For this,, we need accurate and reliable anthropometric data. For reasons of convenience,, self-reported weight and height often replace actual measurements in these interventions. This might lead to misclassification of BMI status during selection of participants and to bias in the assessment of the outcomes. Therefore,, it is fundamental to have validation studies of self-reported web-based data.
31397298#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We included 12.5% of the POEmaS' population (n=159). Anthropometric data reported on the web-platform were compared to measured data by paired T-tests. Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. Multinomial regression was used to investigate factors associated with self-reported weight validity.
31397298#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There was no significant difference between reported and measured weight (0.4 kg,, SD 1.7; p=0.13) and BMI (0.03 kg/m2,, SD 0.87; p=0.06). Reported height was on average 0.4 cm (SD 1.2) higher than the measured ones (p<0.001). For all anthropometric data,, >=95% of the cases were within the limits of agreement. Higher measured BMI was the only factor associated with low accuracy of weight report. Each unit increase in BMI increased the odds that the reported weight was lower than the one measured (OR 1.13; 95%CI 1.01-1.26).
31397298#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Self-reported weight and BMI change showed good agreement with measured ones. Since these are the primary outcomes of the POEmaS trial,, the findings of the validation study suggest that the outcomes' accuracy is high and that it does not vary across gender,, age,, study group. These findings are relevant to digital health researchers and assessors and suggest that digital health interventions for weight loss might rely on self-reported assessment of outcomes. This might be particularly useful when other modes of assessment,, such as anthropometry and e-scales,, are not feasible or not available. However,, we acknowledge that these results might not be applicable to low educated populations.

30825925#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Self monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy is increasingly popular with both health care professionals and patients. We assessed the validity of the iHealth Track and Omron HEM-9210T automated blood pressure devices (with Bluetooth connectivity) for the use in telemonitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy.
30825925#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this prospective observational study,, the revised 2010 International Protocol of the European Hypertension Society (EHS) was used for the validation of the two devices against auscultatory sphygmomanometry by two independent observers who took 13 same arm measurements in 33 pregnant women,, of which 10 were diagnosed with preeclampsia. The measurements were alternated between the test device and a calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer following the protocol. Both automated devices were assessed sequentially in the same women.

30825925#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the group of 33 women,, the iHealth Track passed the EHS 2010 validation criteria with 86/98/99 of 99 device-observer systolic measurement comparisons and 88/96/98 of 99 device-observer diastolic measurement comparisons within the 5/10/15?mmHg boundaries respectively. The Omron HEM-9210T passed the same criteria with 85/94/99 of 99 device-observer systolic measurement comparisons and 82/95/99 of 99 device-observer diastolic measurement comparisons.
30825925#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The iHealth Track and Omron HEM-9210T automated blood pressure monitors are validated for use in pregnancy. These two devices can now be added to the short list of validated devices in pregnancy and can be used for self-measurement of blood pressure in a telemonitoring setting of pregnant patients with (a high risk of) hypertensive disease.

32459642#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Smartphone-based blood pressure (BP) monitoring using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension.
32459642#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to develop a mobile personal health care system for noninvasive,, pervasive,, and continuous estimation of BP level and variability,, which is user friendly for elderly people.
32459642#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The proposed approach was integrated by a self-designed cuffless,, calibration-free,, wireless,, and wearable PPG-only sensor and a native purposely designed smartphone app using multilayer perceptron machine learning techniques from raw signals. We performed a development and usability study with three older adults (mean age 61.3 years,, SD 1.5 years; 66% women) to test the usability and accuracy of the smartphone-based BP monitor.

32459642#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The employed artificial neural network model had good average accuracy (>90%) and very strong correlation (>0.90) (P<.001) for predicting the reference BP values of our validation sample (n=150). Bland-Altman plots showed that most of the errors for BP prediction were less than 10 mmHg. However,, according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society standards,, only diastolic blood pressure prediction met the clinically accepted accuracy thresholds.
32459642#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#With further development and validation,, the proposed system could provide a cost-effective strategy to improve the quality and coverage of health care,, particularly in rural zones,, areas lacking physicians,, and areas with solitary elderly populations.

32720909#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to transform the global health care landscape. The processing power of mobile devices continues to increase,, and growth of mobile phone use has been observed worldwide. Uncertainty remains among key stakeholders and decision makers as to whether global health interventions can successfully tap into this trend. However,, when correctly implemented,, mHealth can reduce geographic,, financial,, and social barriers to quality health care.
32720909#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to design and test Beacon,, a mobile phone-based tool for evaluating mHealth readiness in global health interventions. Here,, we present the results of an application validation study designed to understand the mobile network landscape in and around Macha,, Zambia,, in 2019.
32720909#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Beacon was developed as an automated mobile phone app that continually collects spatiotemporal data and measures indicators of network performance. Beacon was used in and around Macha,, Zambia,, in 2019. Results were collected,, even in the absence of network connectivity,, and asynchronously uploaded to a database for further analysis.
32720909#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Beacon was used to evaluate three mobile phone networks around Macha. Carriers A and B completed 6820/7034 (97.0%) and 6701/7034 (95.3%) downloads and 1349/1608 (83.9%) and 1431/1608 (89.0%) uploads,, respectively,, while Carrier C completed only 62/1373 (4.5%) file downloads and 0/1373 (0.0%) file uploads. File downloads generally occurred within 4 to 12 seconds,, and their maximum download speeds occurred between 2 AM and 5 AM. A decrease in network performance,, demonstrated by increases in upload and download durations,, was observed beginning at 5 PM and continued throughout the evening.

32720909#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Beacon was able to compare the performance of different cellular networks,, show times of day when cellular networks experience heavy loads and slow down,, and identify geographic "dead zones" with limited or no cellular service. Beacon is a ready-to-use tool that could be used by organizations that are considering implementing mHealth interventions in low- and middle-income countries but are questioning the feasibility of the interventions,, including infrastructure and cost. It could also be used by organizations that are looking to optimize the delivery of an existing mHealth intervention with improved logistics management.

34081607#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Advanced prediction of the daily incidence of COVID-19 can aid policy making on the prevention of disease spread,, which can profoundly affect people's livelihood. In previous studies,, predictions were investigated for single or several countries and territories.
34081607#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to develop models that can be applied for real-time prediction of COVID-19 activity in all individual countries and territories worldwide.
34081607#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data of the previous daily incidence and infoveillance data (search volume data via Google Trends) from 215 individual countries and territories were collected. A random forest regression algorithm was used to train models to predict the daily new confirmed cases 7 days ahead. Several methods were used to optimize the models,, including clustering the countries and territories,, selecting features according to the importance scores,, performing multiple-step forecasting,, and upgrading the models at regular intervals. The performance of the models was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE),, root mean square error (RMSE),, Pearson correlation coefficient,, and Spearman correlation coefficient.
34081607#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our models can accurately predict the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in most countries and territories. Of the 215 countries and territories under study,, 198 (92.1%) had MAEs <10 and 187 (87.0%) had Pearson correlation coefficients >0.8. For the 215 countries and territories,, the mean MAE was 5.42 (range 0.26-15.32),, the mean RMSE was 9.27 (range 1.81-24.40),, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.89 (range 0.08-0.99),, and the mean Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.84 (range 0.2-1.00).

32547277#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although the measurement scale developed by Norman and Skinner is the widely used scale to assess consumers' eHealth literacy,, translating and validating the scale for the language of the target population under consideration is necessary. Amharic is the official national language ?of Ethiopia,, with 29.3% of native speakers.
32547277#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The total sample size calculated was 187 with 6% non-response rate. The internal consistency of the ET-eHEALS was measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Test-retest reliability was assessed by re-administering the ET-eHEALS questionnaire to 74 patients which is 40% of the total sample size. Construct validity was evaluated using ?exploratory factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic and Bartlett's test of sphericity were used to check the suitability of performing the factor analysis.
32547277#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the respondents,, 63.1% (n=118) were males and 55.1% (n=103) were aged between 18 and 35 years,, with 57.2% (n=107) of the participants being educated to high school diploma level or higher. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the translated ET-eHEALS total score was 0.94. Test-retest reliability of ET-eHEALS total score was acceptable for both agreements and consistent with ICC (?interclass correlation coefficient) of 0.92. The KMO ratio of sampling appropriateness was acceptable (0.91),, and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant with p < 0.001. The EFA (?exploratory ?factor ?analysis) extracted two factors based on an extraction principle of a minimum eigenvalue of one. The extracted factor explained 80.2% of the common variance which is 51.8% for factor 1 and 28.4% for factor 2. Except for item,, item fit for both infit and outfit mean squares were within the adequate range (0.5-1.5).
32547277#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study depicted that ET-eHEALS is a consistent and valid instrument to evaluate Amharic-speaking chronic patients' eHealth literacy level. Since there is no prior validation of eHEALS in low-income country,, this finding may indicate important directions for further improvement in eHEALS item performance in resource-limited settings.

29853438#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In the cognitive-behavioral approach,, Functional Behavioural Assessment is one of the most effective methods to identify the variables that determine a problem behavior. In this context,, the use of modern technologies can encourage the collection and sharing of behavioral patterns,, effective intervention strategies,, and statistical evidence about antecedents and consequences of clusters of problem behaviors,, encouraging the designing of function-based interventions.
29853438#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The paper describes the development and validation process used to design a specific Functional Behavioural Assessment Ontology (FBA-Ontology). The FBA-Ontology is a semantic representation of the variables that intervene in a behavioral observation process,, facilitating the systematic collection of behavioral data,, the consequential planning of treatment strategies and,, indirectly,, the scientific advancement in this field of study.
29853438#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The ontology has been developed deducing concepts and relationships of the ontology from a gold standard and then performing a machine-based validation and a human-based assessment to validate the Functional Behavioural Assessment Ontology. These validation and verification processes were aimed to verify how much the ontology is conceptually well founded and semantically and syntactically correct.
29853438#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Pellet reasoner checked the logical consistency and the integrity of classes and properties defined in the ontology,, not detecting any violation of constraints in the ontology definition. To assess whether the ontology definition is coherent with the knowledge domain,, human evaluation of the ontology was performed asking 84 people to fill in a questionnaire composed by 13 questions assessing concepts,, relations between concepts,, and concepts' attributes. The response rate for the survey was 29/84 (34.52%). The domain experts confirmed that the concepts,, the attributes,, and the relationships between concepts defined in the FBA-Ontology are valid and well represent the Functional Behavioural Assessment process.
29853438#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The new ontology developed could be a useful tool to design new evidence-based systems in the Behavioral Interventions practices,, encouraging the link with other Linked Open Data datasets and repositories to provide users with new models of eHealth focused on the management of problem behaviors. Therefore,, new research is needed to develop and implement innovative strategies to improve the poor reproducibility and translatability of basic research findings in the field of behavioral assessment.

36191175#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although a great number of teleconsultation services have been developed during the COVID-19 pandemic,, studies assessing usability and health care provider satisfaction are still incipient.
36191175#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to describe the development,, implementation,, and expansion of a synchronous teleconsultation service targeting patients with symptoms of COVID-19 in Brazil,, as well as to assess its usability and health care professionals' satisfaction.
36191175#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This mixed methods study was developed in 5 phases: (1) the identification of components,, technical and functional requirements,, and system architecture; (2) system and user interface development and validation; (3) pilot-testing in the city of Divinópolis; (4) expansion in the cities of Divinópolis,, Teófilo Otoni,, and Belo Horizonte for Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais faculty and students; and (5) usability and satisfaction assessment,, using Likert-scale and open-ended questions.
36191175#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#During pilot development,, problems contacting users were solved by introducing standardized SMS text messages,, which were sent to users to obtain their feedback and keep track of them. Until April 2022,, the expanded system served 31,,966 patients in 146,,158 teleconsultations. Teleconsultations were initiated through chatbot in 27.7% (40,,486/146,,158) of cases. Teleconsultation efficiency per city was 93.7% (13,,317/14,,212) in Teófilo Otoni,, 92.4% (11,,747/12,,713) in Divinópolis,, and 98.8% (4981/5041) in Belo Horizonte (university campus),, thus avoiding in-person assistance for a great majority of patients. In total,, 50 (83%) out of 60 health care professionals assessed the system's usability as satisfactory,, despite a few system instability problems.
36191175#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The system provided updated information about COVID-19 and enabled remote care for thousands of patients,, which evidenced the critical role of telemedicine in expanding emergency services capacity during the pandemic. The dynamic nature of the current pandemic required fast planning,, implementation,, development,, and updates in the system. Usability and satisfaction assessment was key to identifying areas for improvement. The experience reported here is expected to inform telemedicine strategies to be implemented in a postpandemic scenario.

33713188#ABSTRACT##The role of digital pathology in remote reporting has seen an increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently,, recommendations had been made regarding the urgent need of reorganizing head and neck cancer diagnostic services to provide a safe work environment for the staff. A total of 162 glass slides from 109 patients over a period of 5 weeks were included in this validation and were assessed by all pathologists in both analyses (digital and conventional) to allow intraobserver comparison. The intraobserver agreement between the digital method (DM) and conventional method (CM) was considered almost perfect (? ranged from 0.85 to 0.98,, with 95% CI,, ranging from 0.81 to 1). The most significant and frequent disagreements within trainees encompassed epithelial dysplasia grading and differentiation among severe dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The most frequent pitfall from DM was lag in screen mirroring. The lack of details of inflammatory cells and the need for a higher magnification to assess dysplasia were pointed in one case each. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated and consolidated the use of online meeting tools,, which would be a valuable resource even in the post-pandemic scenario. Adaptation in laboratory workflow,, the advent of digital pathology and remote reporting can mitigate the impact of similar future disruptions to the oral and maxillofacial pathology laboratory workflow avoiding delays in diagnosis and report,, to facilitate timely management of head and neck cancer patients.

37157935#ABSTRACT##Recently,, digital health technologies (DHTs) and digital biomarkers have gained a lot of traction in clinical investigations,, motivating sponsors,, investigators,, and regulators to discuss and implement integrated approaches for deploying DHTs. These new tools present new and unique challenges for optimal technology integration in clinical trial processes,, including operational,, ethical,, and regulatory issues. In this paper,, we gathered different perspectives to discuss challenges and perspectives from three different stakeholders: industry,, US regulators,, and a public-private partnership consortium. The complexities of DHT implementation,, which include regulatory definitions,, defining the scope of validation experiments,, and the need for partnerships between BioPharma and the technology sectors,, are highlighted. Most of these challenges are related to translation of DHT-derived measures into endpoints that are meaningful to clinicians and patients,, participant safety,, training,, and retention and privacy of data. The example of the Wearable Assessments in the Clinic and Home in PD (WATCH-PD) study is discussed as an example that demonstrated the advantages of pre-competitive collaborations,, which include early regulatory feedback,, data sharing,, and multistakeholder alignment. Future advances in DHTs are expected to spur device-agnostic measured development and incorporate patient reported outcomes in drug development. More efforts are needed to define validation experiments for a defined context of use,, incentivize data sharing and development of data standards. Multistakeholder collaborations via precompetitive consortia will help facilitate broad acceptance of DHT-enabled measures in drug development.

34936945#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE#Non-invasive methods for postural assessment are tools used for tracking and monitoring the progression of postural deviations. Different computer-based methods have been used to assess human posture,, including mobile applications based on images and sensors. However,, such solutions still require manual identification of anatomical points. This study aims to present and validate the NLMeasurer,, a mobile application for postural assessment. This application takes advantage of the PoseNet,, a solution based on computer vision and machine learning used to estimate human pose and identify anatomical points. From the identified points,, NLMeasurer calculates postural measures.

34936945#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Postural measurements calculated using the NLMeasurer were in agreement with the biophotogrammetry software. Furthermore,, there was good inter- and intra-rater reliability for most photos without surface markers.
34936945#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#NLMeasurer demonstrated to be a valid tool method to assess postural measurements in the frontal view. The use of surface markers on specific anatomical landmarks (i.e.,, ears,, iliac spines and ankles) can facilitate the digital identification of these landmarks and improve the reliability of the postural measurements performed with NLMeasurer.

35035234#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Chronic shoulder pain (SP) is responsible for significant morbidity,, decreased quality of life and impaired work ability,, resulting in high socioeconomic burden. Successful SP management is dependent on adherence and compliance with effective evidence-based interventions. Digital solutions may improve accessibility to such treatments,, increasing convenience,, while reducing healthcare-related costs.
35035234#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Present the results of a fully remote digital care program (DCP) for chronic SP.
35035234#ABSTRACT#PATIENTS AND METHODS#Interventional,, single-arm,, cohort study of individuals with chronic SP applying for a digital care program. Primary outcome was the mean change between baseline and 12 weeks on the Quick Disabilities of the Arm,, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were change in pain (NPRS),, analgesic consumption,, intention to undergo surgery,, anxiety (GAD-7),, depression (PHQ-9),, fear-avoidance beliefs (FABQ-PA),, work productivity (WPAI) and engagement.
35035234#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From 296 patients at program start,, 234 (79.1%) completed the intervention. Changes in QuickDASH between baseline and end-of-program were both statistically (p < 0.001) and clinically significant,, with a mean reduction of 51.6% (mean -13.45 points,, 95% CI: 11.99; 14.92). Marked reductions were also observed in all secondary outcomes: 54.8% in NPRS,, 44.1% ceased analgesics consumption,, 55.5% in surgery intent,, 37.7% in FABQ-PA,, 50.3% in anxiety,, 63.6% in depression and 66.5% in WPAI overall. Higher engagement was associated with higher improvements in disability. Mean patient satisfaction score was 8.7/10.0 (SD 1.6).

34255673#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Conventional clinical trials are essential for generating high-quality evidence by measuring the efficacy of interventions in rigorously controlled clinical environments. However,, their execution can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition,, clinical trials face several logistical challenges regarding the identification,, recruitment,, and retention of participants; consistent data collection during trials; and adequate patient follow-up. This might lead to inefficient resource utilization. In order to partially address the current problems with conventional clinical trials,, there exists the need for innovations. One such innovation is the virtual clinical trial (VCT). VCTs allow for the collection and integration of diverse data from multiple information sources,, such as electronic health records,, clinical and demographic data,, patient-reported outcomes,, anthropometric and activity measurements,, and data collected by digital biomarkers or (small) samples that participants can collect themselves. Although VCTs have the potential to provide substantial value to clinical research and patients because they can lower clinical trial costs,, increase the volume of data collected from patients' daily environment,, and reduce the burden of patient participation,, so far VCT adoption is not commonplace.
34255673#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper aims to better understand the barriers and facilitators to VCT adoption by determining the factors that influence individuals' considerations regarding VCTs from the perspective of various stakeholders.
34255673#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Based on online semistructured interviews,, a qualitative study was conducted with pharmaceutical companies,, food and health organizations,, and an applied research organization in Europe. Data were thematically analyzed using Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory.

34255673#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 16 individuals with interest and experience in VCTs were interviewed,, including persons from pharmaceutical companies (n=6),, food and health organizations (n=4),, and a research organization (n=6). Key barriers included a potentially low degree of acceptance by regulatory authorities,, technical issues (standardization,, validation,, and data storage),, compliance and adherence,, and lack of knowledge or comprehension regarding the opportunities VCTs have to offer. Involvement of regulators in development processes,, stakeholder exposure to the results of pilot studies,, and clear and simple instructions and assistance for patients were considered key facilitators.
34255673#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Collaboration among all stakeholders in VCT development is crucial to increase knowledge and awareness. Organizations should invest in accurate data collection technologies,, and compliance of patients in VCTs needs to be ensured. Multicriteria decision analysis can help determine if a VCT is a preferred option by stakeholders. The findings of this study can be a good starting point to accelerate the development and widespread implementation of VCTs.

30288504#ABSTRACT#UNLABELLED#The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps,, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion,, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers,, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum,, a realization of such a platform,, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with realtime assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally,, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden- and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps,, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms,, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput,, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.

30848839#ABSTRACT#AIM#To validate a novel digital health monitoring system to measure the volume of voided urine.
30848839#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Micturition volume was calculated using our novel digital self-health monitoring system of urine excretion (s-HMSU) in 18 participants (16 women and 2 men; average age,, 40.8 years),, without a history of voiding symptoms. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their medical history and water intake during the period of observation,, as well as the Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS) questionnaire. To assess the reliability of the voided volumes measured using the s-HMSU,, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated between the volume and the change in body weight before and after micturition.
30848839#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The CLSS questionnaire confirmed the absence of urinary system diseases in all participants. The medical history was also negative with the exception of hypertension in one participant. The ICC (1,,1) between the measured volume of urine excretion using the s-HMSU and the change in body weight was 0.972 (95% confidence interval,, 0.957-0.982).
30848839#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The s-HMSU system provides a reliable measure of voiding volume and is appropriate for home use. It has the potential to facilitate large-scale clinical research to examine the relationship between medical diseases and voiding dysfunction.

31758771#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The uptake of digital health technology (DHT) has been surprisingly low in clinical practice. Despite showing great promise to improve patient outcomes and disease management,, there is limited information on the factors that contribute to the limited adoption of DHT,, particularly for hypertension management.
31758771#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This scoping review provides a comprehensive summary of barriers to and facilitators of DHT adoption for hypertension management reported in the published literature with a focus on provider- and patient-related barriers and facilitators.
31758771#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This review followed the methodological framework developed by Arskey and O'Malley. Systematic literature searches were conducted on PubMed or Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online,, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,, and Excerpta Medica database. Articles that reported on barriers to and/or facilitators of digital health adoption for hypertension management published in English between 2008 and 2017 were eligible. Studies not reporting on barriers or facilitators to DHT adoption for management of hypertension were excluded. A total of 2299 articles were identified based on the above criteria after removing duplicates,, and they were assessed for eligibility. Of these,, 2165 references did not meet the inclusion criteria. After assessing 134 studies in full text,, 98 studies were excluded (full texts were either unavailable or studies did not fulfill the inclusion criteria),, resulting in a final set of 32 articles. In addition,, 4 handpicked articles were also included in the review,, making it a total of 36 studies.
31758771#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 36 studies were selected for data extraction after abstract and full-text screening by 2 independent reviewers. All conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify major themes pertaining to barriers and facilitators of DHT from both provider and patient perspectives. The key facilitators of DHT adoption by physicians that were identified include ease of integration with clinical workflow,, improvement in patient outcomes,, and technology usability and technical support. Technology usability and timely technical support improved self-management and patient experience,, and positive impact on patient-provider communication were most frequently reported facilitators for patients. Barriers to use of DHTs reported by physicians include lack of integration with clinical workflow,, lack of validation of technology,, and lack of technology usability and technical support. Finally,, lack of technology usability and technical support,, interference with patient-provider relationship,, and lack of validation of technology were the most commonly reported barriers by patients.
31758771#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings suggest the settings and context in which DHTs are implemented and individuals involved in implementation influence adoption. Finally,, to fully realize the potential of digitally enabled hypertension management,, there is a greater need to validate these technologies to provide patients and providers with reliable and accurate information on both clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness.

35330469#ABSTRACT##Mobile devices are widely used among young people,, and their use for health promotion is in-creasing. Healthy Jeart is a mobile application aimed at promoting healthy life habits among people aged 8-16 years. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an instrument that allows evaluating the healthy knowledge,, habits and attitudes learned by adolescents aged 12-16 years through the Healthy Jeart application. Attending to the content of Healthy Jeart,, a first version of the evaluation instrument was generated. It was subjected to expert judgement. The second version was administered to 429 adolescents from six educational centres of Andalusia to carry out the validation of the construct through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. After exploration,, a six-factor model was confirmed,, with a very adequate level of fit and good internal consistency. The six factors were: (1) knowledge about eating and physical activity,, (2) habits about eating and physical activity,, (3) emotional health,, (4) consumption of alcohol and drugs,, (5) social relationships and (6) sexual activities and use of technologies. There are at least four instruments that could be used to measure health-promoting behaviours. However,, this new instrument was created ad hoc. It measures exactly the results that can be expected. Healthy Jeart will now have a valid and reliable evaluation instrument: Ev-HealthyJRT v.1.0. Young people,, teachers and other professionals who carry out health-promotion interventions based on Healthy Jeart with adolescents will have at their disposal an instrument integrated in this app that allows verifying the learning results. However,, the validated instrument can be used for evaluation in other interventions,, as long as the multiple and essential aspects of a healthy living are addressed as in Healthy Jeart.

32432558#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic tracking has been utilized for a variety of health conditions. Previous studies have shown that there is higher adherence to electronic methods vs paper-and-pencil tracking modalities. Electronic tracking also ensures that there are no back-filled entries,, where patients have-to appear compliant-entered their responses retrospectively just before their visits with their health care provider. On the basis of the recognition of an unmet need for a Web-based automated platform to track psychiatric outcomes,, Johns Hopkins University partnered with Health Central (a subsidiary of Remedy Health Media LLC) to develop Mood 24/7,, an electronic,, mobile,, automated,, SMS-based mood tracker. This is a pilot study to validate the use of Mood 24/7 in anticipation of clinical trials to demonstrate the therapeutic benefit on patients' health outcomes of utilizing digital mood-tracking technology.
32432558#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Mood 24/7 is an electronic mood-monitoring platform developed to accurately and efficiently track mood over time through automated daily SMS texts or emails. This study was designed to assess the accuracy and validity of Mood 24/7 in an outpatient psychiatric setting.
32432558#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This pilot study involved a retrospective chart review for depressed outpatients (N=9) to compare their self-reported Mood 24/7 daily mood ratings with their psychiatrist's independent clinical mood assessment at the time of the patient's visit. Their mood ratings via Mood 24/7 were collected over 36 weeks. In addition,, a mixed model analysis was applied to compare the weekly Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores with Mood 24/7 scores over an average of 3 months.
32432558#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A 97.2% (315/324) digital mood reporting adherence was found over 36 weeks,, and a significant correlation (r=0.86,, P<.001) was observed between patients' Mood 24/7 scores and their psychiatrist's blinded clinical assessment of the patient's mood when seen in the clinic. In addition,, a significant concordance (intraclass correlation of 0.69,, 95% CI 0.33-0.91,, P<.001) was observed in the mixed model analysis of the clinician-administered MADRS vs Mood 24/7 scores over time.
32432558#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our chart review and mixed model analyses demonstrate that Mood 24/7 is a valid instrument for convenient,, simple,, noninvasive,, and accurate longitudinal mood assessment in the outpatient clinical setting.

15000351#ABSTRACT##A prototype,, content-based image retrieval system has been built employing a client/server architecture to access supercomputing power from the physician's desktop. The system retrieves images and their associated annotations from a networked microscopic pathology image database based on content similarity to user supplied query images. Similarity is evaluated based on four image feature types: color histogram,, image texture,, Fourier coefficients,, and wavelet coefficients,, using the vector dot product as a distance metric. Current retrieval accuracy varies across pathological categories depending on the number of available training samples and the effectiveness of the feature set. The distance measure of the search algorithm was validated by agglomerative cluster analysis in light of the medical domain knowledge. Results show a correlation between pathological significance and the image document distance value generated by the computer algorithm. This correlation agrees with observed visual similarity. This validation method has an advantage over traditional statistical evaluation methods when sample size is small and where domain knowledge is important. A multi-dimensional scaling analysis shows a low dimensionality nature of the embedded space for the current test set.

34846076#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Accurate dietary intake data are critical to nutrition care planning. Commonly used food record charts (FRC) are paper-based,, time consuming,, require nutrient analysis estimations,, and may provide limited accuracy. The present study aimed to validate Mobile Intake® (MI) (an electronic food intake tool incorporating the five-point visual scale and providing automatic nutrient analysis) for usability and efficacy in quantifying dietary intake in the healthcare setting.
34846076#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two research stages within two tertiary hospitals included: (1) examining criterion validity and efficiency of dietary intake quantification using FRC and MI compared to the gold standard weighed food record (WFR) in a controlled environment and (2) comparing efficiency and effectiveness of FRC and MI in usual care conditions.
34846076#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In Stage 1,, dietary intake was calculated (n?=?90) with a significant difference across all methods (FRC,, MI and WFR) for energy (p?=?0.04),, but not between MI and WFR (p?=?1.00). The time taken for MI (40?s) was significantly less than FRC (174?s) and WFR (371?s) (p?<?001). In Stage 2,, dietary intake was determined (n?=?210) using FRC and MI. Sufficient data to complete dietary analysis were available for 35% of meals from FRC compared to 98% from MI. Calculated mean daily energy intake (4764?±?1432?kJ vs. 6636?±?2519?kJ,, p?=?0.002) and mean daily protein intake (62.9?±?12.7?g vs. 78.5?±?22.2?g,, p?=?0.007) were significantly lower with FRC compared to MI. Average time to complete MI was 14.4 seconds.
34846076#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MI demonstrates efficacy as an accurate measure of dietary intake compared to WFR,, as well as usability,, providing faster,, more accurate and comprehensive real-time intake data in practice than FRC.

31445295#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION AND AIM#In recent years,, numerous health-related apps have appeared on the market,, and assessing their quality has become crucial. A very popular tool worldwide,, created especially for this purpose,, is the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). However,, there are no similar tools in Spanish. Therefore,, the aim of this paper is to adapt MARS to the Spanish language and validate the resultant version.
31445295#ABSTRACT#METHOD#The design consists of three processes: cross-cultural adaptation,, translation,, and metric evaluation. 46 mobile applications,, 23 of which were for Apple telephones and 23 of which were for telephones running Android,, were included in the study. The main objective of these applications was to promote physical activity. The internal factor structure and reliability of MARS were examined.
31445295#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#No major differences were observed in the two Spanish translations,, which were carried out independently. The blind back-translation,, reviewed by the original author of MARS,, suggested minor edits. Discrimination indices (item-scale correlation) obtained appropriate results for both raters. The reliability of the scores was found to be appropriate both in terms of internal consistency (a?>?0.77),, temporal stability (r?>?0.72),, and inter-rater reliability (IC?>?0.76). The correlations between the subscales have shown high values with range between 0.47 and 0.83.
31445295#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The Spanish version of MARS was shown to have appropriate metric properties to assess the quality of health apps.

27655245#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Depression is a burdensome,, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries,, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support.

27655245#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is 2-fold,, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level,, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms.
27655245#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS),, collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time,, location,, and personal preference. Biweekly,, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer,, Wifi,, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery.
27655245#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for =2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9=11) at baseline and adherence =8 weeks (n=12),, a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498,, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143),, with a cutoff of PHQ-9=11,, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy,, respectively.
27655245#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi,, accelerometer,, GPS,, and phone use,, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation,, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.

33138889#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Symptoms of serious mental illness are multidimensional and often interact in complex ways. Generative models offer value in elucidating the underlying relationships that characterise these networks of symptoms.
33138889#ABSTRACT#AIMS#In this paper we use generative models to find unique interactions of schizophrenia symptoms as experienced on a moment-by-moment basis.
33138889#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Self-reported mood,, anxiety and psychosis symptoms,, self-reported measurements of sleep quality and social function,, cognitive assessment,, and smartphone touch screen data from two assessments modelled after the Trail Making A and B tests were collected with a digital phenotyping app for 47 patients in active treatment for schizophrenia over a 90-day period. Patients were retrospectively divided up into various non-exclusive subgroups based on measurements of depression,, anxiety,, sleep duration,, cognition and psychosis symptoms taken in the clinic. Associated transition probabilities for the patient cohort and for the clinical subgroups were calculated using state transitions between adjacent 3-day timesteps of pairwise survey domains.
33138889#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The three highest probabilities for associated transitions across all patients were anxiety-inducing mood (0.357,, P < 0.001),, psychosis-inducing mood (0.276,, P < 0.001),, and anxiety-inducing poor sleep (0.268,, P < 0.001). These transition probabilities were compared against a validation set of 17 patients from a pilot study,, and no significant differences were found. Unique symptom networks were found for clinical subgroups.

33138889#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using a generative model using digital phenotyping data,, we show that certain symptoms of schizophrenia may play a role in elevating other schizophrenia symptoms in future timesteps. Symptom networks show that it is feasible to create clinically interpretable models that reflect the unique symptom interactions of psychosis-spectrum illness. These results offer a framework for researchers capturing temporal dynamics,, for clinicians seeking to move towards preventative care,, and for patients to better understand their lived experience.
33574002#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE#The use of smartphone applications is ubiquitous within healthcare. Over recent years there have been multiple applications developed within the field of plastic surgery. In the UK,, applications with a medical purpose should be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) as a medical device. The aim of this study was to evaluate plastic surgery specific smartphone applications designed for healthcare professional usage,, and determine what proportion meet the criteria of a medical device and are suitably certified.
33574002#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A systematic review of the Apple and Google Play App stores was carried out using search terms relevant to plastic surgery. Data was extracted from the app store listing,, developer website and the contents of each application. Each application was evaluated against the criteria given by the MHRA to determine whether it constituted a medical device.
33574002#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#215 applications for plastic surgery healthcare professionals were identified,, of which 22 met the definition of a medical device. Only 14% (n = 3) of these applications were appropriately certified,, 14% (n = 3) were validated in peer-reviewed literature and 45% (n = 10) had documented medical professional involvement.
33574002#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Most applications with a medical purpose were not certified as a medical device,, had not been validated in any peer-reviewed research,, and did not have any documented involvement of medical professionals. The potential consequences of such applications operating incorrectly are stark and represent a risk to patient safety. Usage of multiple applications in a single patient encounter may compound error and safety of clinical care.

33938875#ABSTRACT##TBase is an electronic health record (EHR) for kidney transplant recipients (KTR) combining automated data entry of key clinical data (e.g.,, laboratory values,, medical reports,, radiology and pathology data) via standardized interfaces with manual data entry during routine treatment (e.g.,, clinical notes,, medication list,, and transplantation data). By this means,, a comprehensive database for KTR is created with benefits for routine clinical care and research. It enables both easy everyday clinical use and quick access for research questions with highest data quality. This is achieved by the concept of data validation in clinical routine in which clinical users and patients have to rely on correct data for treatment and medication plans and thereby validate and correct the clinical data in their daily practice. This EHR is tailored for the needs of transplant outpatient care and proved its clinical utility for more than 20 years at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. It facilitates efficient routine work with well-structured,, comprehensive long-term data and allows their easy use for clinical research. To this point,, its functionality covers automated transmission of routine data via standardized interfaces from different hospital information systems,, availability of transplant-specific data,, a medication list with an integrated check for drug-drug interactions,, and semi-automated generation of medical reports among others. Key elements of the latest reengineering are a robust privacy-by-design concept,, modularity,, and hence portability into other clinical contexts as well as usability and platform independence enabled by HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language) based responsive web design. This allows fast and easy scalability into other disease areas and other university hospitals. The comprehensive long-term datasets are the basis for the investigation of Machine Learning algorithms,, and the modular structure allows to rapidly implement these into clinical care. Patient reported data and telemedicine services are integrated into TBase in order to meet future needs of the patients. These novel features aim to improve clinical care as well as to create new research options and therapeutic interventions.

31284810#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Studies show Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are at increased risk of dementia. Whilst there have been several studies evaluating the use of telehealth for improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes,, and studies validating telehealth dementia screening tools for the wider community,, none have addressed the pressing need for culturally appropriate telehealth dementia screening for this at-risk population. The aim of the study was to examine the utility of using a culturally appropriate dementia screening tool (KICA-screen) in a telehealth setting.
31284810#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A prospective field trial was used to compare administration of the short version of the Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment (KICA-screen) face-to-face and via telehealth. A total of 33 medically stable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inpatients/outpatients participated. The stability of the KICA-screen scores,, administered face-to-face and via telehealth,, for each participant was measured.
31284810#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Results of the assessment showed that KICA-screen can be reliably administered via videoconference and resulted in comparable scores to face-to-face testing in the majority of cases. The telehealth process was acceptable to participants,, who were able to understand the process and complete the full screen remotely.

37067854#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Measuring pain on digital devices using classic unidimensional pain scales such as the visual analog scale (VAS),, numerical rating scale (NRS),, and faces pain scale (FPS) has been proven to be reliable and valid. Emoji are pictographs designed in colorful form following the Unicode standard. It could be more beneficial to use emoji as faces of FPS on digital devices because emoji can easily fit on most devices and emoji are open-source so no approval would be needed before use. With a concise and user-friendly design,, the emoji faces pain scale (Emoji-FPS) might be more generalizable to a wider population and more preferred by digital device users.

37067854#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study was designed to develop an Emoji-FPS as well as to evaluate its reliability,, validity,, and preference on mobile devices in adult patients who underwent surgery.
37067854#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A modified Delphi technique with 2 rounds of web-based surveys was applied to obtain panelists' consensus on the sequence of emoji that can best represent 6 levels of pain. The initial candidate sequences of emoji for the Delphi process were constructed referring to 2 well-validated FPSs (Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale [Wong-Baker FACES] and faces pain scale-revised [FPS-R]). Then,, a prospective cohort of patients scheduled to receive perianal surgery was recruited and asked to complete a web-based questionnaire on a mobile device at 5 time points (before surgery [T1],, wake up after surgery [T2],, 4 hours after surgery [T3],, the second day after surgery [T4],, and 15 minutes after T4 [T5]). The 4 well-validated pain scales (NRS,, VAS,, Wong-Baker FACES,, and FPS-R) were used as reference scales.
37067854#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After 2 rounds of surveys on 40 Delphi panelists,, an Emoji-FPS was finally determined to represent 6 pain levels (0,, 2,, 4,, 6,, 8,, and 10) from "no hurt" to "hurts worst." For validation,, 300 patients were recruited and 299 were analyzed,, the mean age of whom was 38.5 (SD 10.5) years,, and 106 (35.5%) were women. For concurrent validity,, the Emoji-FPS was highly correlated with 4 reference scales with Spearman correlation coefficient ? ranging from 0.91 to 0.95. Excellent agreements were observed between 4 versions of Emoji-FPS (iOS,, Android,, Microsoft,, and OpenMoji),, with weighted ? coefficients ranging from 0.96 to 0.97. For discriminant validity,, patients' mean preoperative Emoji-FPS score (T1) was significantly higher than their postoperative Emoji-FPS score (T4) with a difference of 1.4 (95% CI 1.3-1.6; P<.001). For test-retest reliability,, Emoji-FPS scores measured at T4 and T5 were highly correlated with a ? of 0.91. The Emoji-FPS was mostly preferred,, followed by the Wong-Baker FACES,, FPS-R,, NRS,, and VAS.
37067854#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Emoji-FPS is reliable and valid compared with traditional pain scales in adult surgery patients.

29942566#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Internet use may affect health and health service use,, and is seen as a potential lever for empowering patients,, levelling inequalities and managing costs in the health system. However,, supporting evidence is scant,, partially due to a lack of data to investigate the relationship on a larger scale. This paper presents an approach for connecting existing datasets to generate new insights.

29942566#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Spatial microsimulation offers a way to combine a random sample survey on Internet use with aggregate census data and other routine data from the health system based on small geographic areas to examine the relationship between Internet use,, perceived health and health service use. While health research has primarily used spatial microsimulation to estimate the geographic distribution of a certain phenomenon,, this research highlights this simulation technique as a way to link datasets for joint analysis,, with location as the connecting element.
29942566#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Internet use is associated with higher perceived health and lower health service use independently of whether Internet use was conceptualised in terms of access,, support or usage,, and controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Internal validation confirms that differences between actual and simulated data are small; external validation shows that the simulated dataset is a good re?ection of the real world.
29942566#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Spatial microsimulation helps to generate new insights through linking secondary data in a privacy-preserving and cost-effective way. This allows for better understanding the relationship between Internet use and health,, enabling theoretical insights and practical implications for policy with insights down to the local level.

37046978#ABSTRACT##Mobile health (mHealth) apps are designed to support health behavior outcomes and improve well-being. The existing body of literature confirms mHealth's overall efficacy in promoting physical activity; however,, more research on its utility in sustaining user engagement is needed. Understanding the determinants of an individual's willingness to continue using mHealth is vital to improving the intervention's success. This study developed a unified model and survey instrument adapted from extant literature while introducing new constructs to predict the sustained use of gamified mHealth. A pilot study was conducted to validate the survey instrument using 48 gamified fitness app users in Malaysia. The survey instrument was tested following rigorous guidelines for quantitative research in the information system context. According to the findings,, the reliabilities of most measurement items met the criterion,, and those items were retained. Overall,, this paper contributes by integrating social comparison theory and the self-determination theory for sustaining user engagement with gamified mHealth through an extrinsic and intrinsic motivation perspective.

36125855#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mental health issues among emerging adults (aged 19-25 years) on a global scale have underscored the need to address their widespread experiences of depression and anxiety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,, emerging studies are being directed toward the development and deployment of digital peer emotional disclosure and support for the psychological well-being of emerging adults. However,, it is important to explore the implementation and clinical effectiveness,, as well as associated mechanisms of change,, for optimal approaches in conducting digital peer support interventions for emerging adults' psychological well-being.
36125855#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We describe a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the implementation and clinical effectiveness of Acceset,, a digital peer support intervention to address emerging adult mental well-being. The intervention has 2 components. First,, the digital peer support training equips befrienders (ie,, peers who provide support) to harness 4 components of psychological well-being-mattering,, selfhood,, compassion,, and mindfulness-to provide effective peer support for seekers (ie,, peers who seek support). Second,, Acceset incorporates psychological well-being digital markers and harnesses community engagement to drive emotional disclosure among peers.
36125855#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 100 participants (aged 19-25 years) from the National University of Singapore will be recruited and randomized into 2 arms. In arm 1 (n=50),, the seekers will use Acceset with befrienders (n=30) as well as moderators (n=30) for 3 weeks. Arm 2 comprises a wait-listed control group (n=50). A questionnaire battery will be used to monitor seekers and befrienders at 4 time points. These include baseline (before the intervention),, 3 weeks (end of the intervention),, and 6 and 9 weeks (carryover effect measurement). Implementation outcomes of the intervention will involve evaluation of the training curriculum with respect to adoption and fidelity as well as user acceptability of the Acceset platform and its feasibility for broader deployment. Clinical outcomes will include mattering,, selfhood,, compassion,, mindfulness,, perceived social support,, and psychological well-being scores.
36125855#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This protocol received National University of Singapore Institutional Ethics Review Board approval in October 2021. Recruitment will commence in January 2022. We expect data collection and analyses to be completed in June 2022. Preliminary findings are expected to be published in December 2022. The Cohen d index will be used for effect size estimation with a .05 (95% reliability) significance level and 80% power.
36125855#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This protocol considers a novel digital peer support intervention-Acceset-that incorporates components and digital markers of emerging adult mental well-being. Through the validation of the Acceset intervention,, this study defines the parameters and conditions for digital peer support interventions for emerging adults.

35251679#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND AIMS#Accurate and user-friendly assessment tools quantifying alcohol consumption are a prerequisite to effective prevention and treatment programmes,, including Screening and Brief Intervention. Digital tools offer new potential in this field. We developed the 'Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool' (AAA-Tool),, a mobile app providing an interactive version of the World Health Organization's Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) that facilitates the description of individual alcohol consumption via culturally informed animation features. This pilot study evaluated the Russia-specific version of the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool with regard to (1) its usability and acceptability in a primary healthcare setting,, (2) the plausibility of its alcohol consumption assessment results and (3) the adequacy of its Russia-specific vessel and beverage selection.
35251679#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Convenience samples of 55 patients (47% female) and 15 healthcare practitioners (80% female) in 2 Russian primary healthcare facilities self-administered the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool and rated their experience on the Mobile Application Rating Scale - User Version. Usage data was automatically collected during app usage,, and additional feedback on regional content was elicited in semi-structured interviews.
35251679#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#On average,, patients completed the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool in 6:38 min (SD?=?2.49,, range?=?3.00-17.16). User satisfaction was good,, with all subscale Mobile Application Rating Scale - User Version scores averaging >3 out of 5 points. A majority of patients (53%) and practitioners (93%) would recommend the tool to 'many people' or 'everyone'. Assessed alcohol consumption was plausible,, with a low number (14%) of logically impossible entries. Most patients reported the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool to reflect all vessels (78%) and all beverages (71%) they typically used.
35251679#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#High acceptability ratings by patients and healthcare practitioners,, acceptable completion time,, plausible alcohol usage assessment results and perceived adequacy of region-specific content underline the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool's potential to provide a novel approach to alcohol assessment in primary healthcare. After its validation,, the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool might contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm by facilitating Screening and Brief Intervention implementation in Russia and beyond.

36066940#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic health record (EHR) systems are becoming increasingly complicated,, leading to concerns about rising physician burnout,, particularly for primary care physicians (PCPs). Managing the most common cardiometabolic chronic conditions by PCPs during a limited clinical time with a patient is challenging.
36066940#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to evaluate a Cardiometabolic Sutter Health Advanced Reengineered Encounter (CM-SHARE),, a web-based application to visualize key EHR data,, on the EHR use efficiency.
36066940#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed algorithms to identify key clinic workflow measures (eg,, total encounter time,, total physician time in the examination room,, and physician EHR time in the examination room) using audit data,, and we validated and calibrated the measures with time-motion data. We used a pre-post parallel design to identify propensity score-matched CM-SHARE users (cases),, nonusers (controls),, and nested-matched patients. Cardiometabolic encounters from matched case and control patients were used for the workflow evaluation. Outcome measures were compared between the cases and controls. We applied this approach separately to both the CM-SHARE pilot and spread phases.
36066940#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Combining EHR audit log files and clinical information,, our approach offers an innovative and scalable method and new measures that can be used to evaluate clinical EHR efficiency of digital tools used in clinical settings.

36066940#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Time-motion observation was conducted on 101 primary care encounters for 9 PCPs in 3 clinics. There was little difference (<0.8 minutes) between the audit data-derived workflow measures and the time-motion observation. Two key unobservable times from audit data,, physician entry into and exiting the examination room,, were imputed based on time-motion studies. CM-SHARE was launched with 6 pilot PCPs in April 2016. During the prestudy period (April 1,, 2015,, to April 1,, 2016),, 870 control patients with 2845 encounters were matched with 870 case patients and encounters,, and 727 case patients with 852 encounters were matched with 727 control patients and 3754 encounters in the poststudy period (June 1,, 2016,, to June 30,, 2017). Total encounter time was slightly shorter (mean -2.7,, SD 1.4 minutes,, 95% CI -4.7 to -0.9; mean -1.6,, SD 1.1 minutes,, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.1) for cases than controls for both periods. CM-SHARE saves physicians approximately 2 minutes EHR time in the examination room (mean -2.0,, SD 1.3,, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.9) compared with prestudy period and poststudy period controls (mean -1.9,, SD 0.9,, 95% CI -3.8 to -0.5). In the spread phase,, 48 CM-SHARE spread PCPs were matched with 84 control PCPs and 1272 cases with 3412 control patients,, having 1119 and 4240 encounters,, respectively. A significant reduction in total encounter time for the CM-SHARE group was observed for short appointments (=20 minutes; 5.3-minute reduction on average) only. Total physician EHR time was significantly reduced for both longer and shorter appointments (17%-33% reductions).

24161879#ABSTRACT##This paper describes a social media system to prevent dengue in Sri Lanka and potentially in the rest of the South and Southeast Asia regions. The system integrates three concepts of public health prevention that have thus far been implemented only in silos. First,, the predictive surveillance component uses a computer simulation to forewarn health authorities and the general public about impending disease outbreaks. The civic engagement component allows the general public to use social media tools to interact and engage with health authorities by aiding them in surveillance efforts by reporting symptoms,, mosquito bites and breeding sites using smartphone technologies. The health communication component utilizes citizen data gathered from the first two components to disseminate customized health awareness messages to enhance knowledge and increase preventive behaviors among citizens. The system,, known as "Mo-Buzz,," will be made available on a host of digital platforms like simple mobile phones,, smart phones and a website. We present challenges and lessons learnt including content validation,, stakeholder collaborations and applied trans-disciplinary research.

29999214#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To detail the development method used to produce an online,, tailored,, theory-based,, user-centred intervention to encourage help-seeking for potential lung cancer symptoms.
29999214#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#Intervention development was structured around the person-based approach. The feasibility study involved a randomized controlled trial design.
29999214#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Intervention development drew on qualitative inquiries,, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB),, and identifying concrete mechanisms of change to implement in the intervention (Behaviour Change Techniques). The final intervention involved two key features: (1) tailoring and (2) 'TPB components' to target beliefs about help-seeking. In an online feasibility study,, we recruited people reporting potential lung cancer symptoms using mailing lists,, social media,, websites,, and Google AdWords. Participants were randomized to the intervention,, a tailored comparison group (CG) without TPB-components,, an untailored CG with TPB components,, or a CG with neither. Following treatment,, participants clicked a button to indicate whether they wished to make an appointment and completed a TPB questionnaire.
29999214#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 130 participants reporting relevant symptoms were recruited (24% of website visitors). Participants in the intervention group reported higher intention to seek help than those who received tailored information without TPB components (p = .03). User comments indicate more support is needed for people who sought help for symptoms,, but felt dismissed.

29999214#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The potential for differential dropout in online randomized trials requires careful consideration. Future help-seeking interventions should provide support for those who have previously felt dismissed by health professionals. The feasibility study provides some evidence that our 'TPB components' were effective,, but validation in a powered trial is necessary. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? People with lung cancer often delay presenting symptoms to health services. Some patients (or their family/friends) look up symptoms online before their diagnosis,, to decide whether they should see a doctor. Interventions are needed to ensure people can find useful information online that will encourage them to seek help for relevant symptoms. What does this study add? Theory-mapping and user involvement facilitated systematic intervention development. Lung cancer help-seeking interventions should address salient beliefs and personal relevance. The potential for differential dropout in online randomized trials requires careful consideration.

31599936#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To summarize the research literature about safety concerns with consumer-facing health apps and their consequences.
31599936#ABSTRACT#MATERIALS AND METHODS#We searched bibliographic databases including PubMed,, Web of Science,, Scopus,, and Cochrane libraries from January 2013 to May 2019 for articles about health apps. Descriptive information about safety concerns and consequences were extracted and classified into natural categories. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement.
31599936#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 74 studies identified,, the majority were reviews of a single or a group of similar apps (n?=?66,, 89%),, nearly half related to disease management (n?=?34,, 46%). A total of 80 safety concerns were identified,, 67 related to the quality of information presented including incorrect or incomplete information,, variation in content,, and incorrect or inappropriate response to consumer needs. The remaining 13 related to app functionality including gaps in features,, lack of validation for user input,, delayed processing,, failure to respond to health dangers,, and faulty alarms. Of the 52 reports of actual or potential consequences,, 5 had potential for patient harm. We also identified 66 reports about gaps in app development,, including the lack of expert involvement,, poor evidence base,, and poor validation.
31599936#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Safety of apps is an emerging public health issue. The available evidence shows that apps pose clinical risks to consumers. Involvement of consumers,, regulators,, and healthcare professionals in development and testing can improve quality. Additionally,, mandatory reporting of safety concerns is needed to improve outcomes.

35613417#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#To provide effective care for inpatients with COVID-19,, clinical practitioners need systems that monitor patient health and subsequently allow for risk scoring. Existing approaches for risk scoring in patients with COVID-19 focus primarily on intensive care units (ICUs) with specialized medical measurement devices but not on hospital general wards.
35613417#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this paper,, we aim to develop a risk score for inpatients with COVID-19 in general wards based on consumer-grade wearables (smartwatches).
35613417#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients wore consumer-grade wearables to record physiological measurements,, such as the heart rate (HR),, heart rate variability (HRV),, and respiration frequency (RF). Based on Bayesian survival analysis,, we validated the association between these measurements and patient outcomes (ie,, discharge or ICU admission). To build our risk score,, we generated a low-dimensional representation of the physiological features. Subsequently,, a pooled ordinal regression with time-dependent covariates inferred the probability of either hospital discharge or ICU admission. We evaluated the predictive performance of our developed system for risk scoring in a single-center,, prospective study based on 40 inpatients with COVID-19 in a general ward of a tertiary referral center in Switzerland.
35613417#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#First,, Bayesian survival analysis showed that physiological measurements from consumer-grade wearables are significantly associated with patient outcomes (ie,, discharge or ICU admission). Second,, our risk score achieved a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.73-0.90 based on leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.
35613417#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of consumer-grade wearables for risk scoring in inpatients with COVID-19. Due to their low cost and ease of use,, consumer-grade wearables could enable a scalable monitoring system.

32049066#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#New consumer health devices are being developed to easily monitor multiple physiological parameters on a regular basis. Many of these vital sign measurement devices have yet to be formally studied in a clinical setting but have already spread widely throughout the consumer market.
32049066#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#) measurements of 2 novel all-in-one monitoring devices,, the BodiMetrics Performance Monitor and the Everlast smartwatch.
32049066#ABSTRACT#METHODS#. After 5 min of quiet sitting,, four hospital-grade standard and three investigational vital sign measurements were taken,, with 60 seconds in between each measurement. The reference vital sign measurements were calculated by determining the average of the two standard measurements that bounded each investigational measurement. Using this method,, we determined three comparison pairs for each investigational device in each subject. After excluding data from 42 individuals because of excessive variation in sequential standard measurements per prespecified dropping rules,, data from 85 subjects were used for final analysis.
32049066#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# measurements was 3.02%.
32049066#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Both devices we investigated met accuracy guidelines for HR measurements,, but they failed to meet the predefined accuracy guidelines for other vital sign measurements. Continued sale of consumer physiological monitors without prior validation and approval procedures is a public health concern.

30855232#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Wrist-worn smart watches and fitness monitors (ie,, wearables) have become widely adopted by consumers and are gaining increased attention from researchers for their potential contribution to naturalistic digital measurement of health in a scalable,, mobile,, and unobtrusive way. Various studies have examined the accuracy of these devices in controlled laboratory settings (eg,, treadmill and stationary bike); however,, no studies have investigated the heart rate accuracy of wearables during a continuous and ecologically valid 24-hour period of actual consumer device use conditions.

30855232#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to determine the heart rate accuracy of 2 popular wearable devices,, the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2,, as compared with the gold standard reference method,, an ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG),, during consumer device use conditions in an individual. Data were collected across 5 daily conditions,, including sitting,, walking,, running,, activities of daily living (ADL; eg,, chores,, brushing teeth),, and sleeping.
30855232#ABSTRACT#METHODS#One participant,, (first author; 29-year-old Caucasian male) completed a 24-hour ecologically valid protocol by wearing 2 popular wrist wearable devices (Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2). In addition,, an ambulatory ECG (Vrije Universiteit Ambulatory Monitoring System) was used as the gold standard reference method,, which resulted in the collection of 102,,740 individual heartbeats. A single-subject design was used to keep all variables constant except for wearable devices while providing a rapid response design to provide initial assessment of wearable accuracy for allowing the research cycle to keep pace with technological advancements. Accuracy of these devices compared with the gold standard ECG was assessed using mean error,, mean absolute error,, and mean absolute percent error. These data were supplemented with Bland-Altman analyses and concordance class correlation to assess agreement between devices.
30855232#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2 were generally highly accurate across the 24-hour condition. Specifically,, the Apple Watch 3 had a mean difference of -1.80 beats per minute (bpm),, a mean absolute error percent of 5.86%,, and a mean agreement of 95% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. The Fitbit Charge 2 had a mean difference of -3.47 bpm,, a mean absolute error of 5.96%,, and a mean agreement of 91% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. These findings varied by condition.
30855232#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Apple Watch 3 and the Fitbit Charge 2 provided acceptable heart rate accuracy (<±10%) across the 24 hour and during each activity,, except for the Apple Watch 3 during the daily activities condition. Overall,, these findings provide preliminary support that these devices appear to be useful for implementing ambulatory measurement of cardiac activity in research studies,, especially those where the specific advantages of these methods (eg,, scalability,, low participant burden) are particularly suited to the population or research question.

29581092#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and one of the most common forms of movement disorder. Although there is no known cure for PD,, existing therapies can provide effective symptomatic relief. However,, optimal titration is crucial to avoid adverse effects. Today,, decision making for PD management is challenging because it relies on subjective clinical evaluations that require a visit to the clinic. This challenge has motivated recent research initiatives to develop tools that can be used by nonspecialists to assess psychomotor impairment. Among these emerging solutions,, we recently reported the neuroQWERTY index,, a new digital marker able to detect motor impairment in an early PD cohort through the analysis of the key press and release timing data collected during a controlled in-clinic typing task.
29581092#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to extend the in-clinic implementation to an at-home implementation by validating the applicability of the neuroQWERTY approach in an uncontrolled at-home setting,, using the typing data from subjects' natural interaction with their laptop to enable remote and unobtrusive assessment of PD signs.
29581092#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We implemented the data-collection platform and software to enable access and storage of the typing data generated by users while using their computer at home. We recruited a total of 60 participants; of these participants 52 (25 people with Parkinson's and 27 healthy controls) provided enough data to complete the analysis. Finally,, to evaluate whether our in-clinic-built algorithm could be used in an uncontrolled at-home setting,, we compared its performance on the data collected during the controlled typing task in the clinic and the results of our method using the data passively collected at home.
29581092#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Despite the randomness and sparsity introduced by the uncontrolled setting,, our algorithm performed nearly as well in the at-home data (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.76 and sensitivity/specificity of 0.73/0.69) as it did when used to evaluate the in-clinic data (AUC 0.83 and sensitivity/specificity of 0.77/0.72). Moreover,, the keystroke metrics presented a strong correlation between the 2 typing settings,, which suggests a minimal influence of the in-clinic typing task in users' normal typing.
29581092#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The finding that an algorithm trained on data from an in-clinic setting has comparable performance with that tested on data collected through naturalistic at-home computer use reinforces the hypothesis that subtle differences in motor function can be detected from typing behavior. This work represents another step toward an objective,, user-convenient,, and quasi-continuous monitoring tool for PD.

35749208#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Existing modes of collecting self-reported 24-hour movement information from children,, including digital assessments,, have not been demonstrated to be of acceptable validity when compared to objective measurements. My E-Diary for Activities and Lifestyle (MEDAL) is an interactive web-based diary developed to collect time-use information from children aged 10 years and older.
35749208#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study evaluated the validity of MEDAL for assessing children's movement behaviors by comparing self-reported and accelerometer-measured time spent in movement behavior among children in Singapore aged 10-11 years.
35749208#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Funding for this study was obtained in October 2017,, and data were collected between April and August 2020. Participants recorded their daily activities using MEDAL over 2 specified weekdays and 2 weekend days and wore an Actigraph accelerometer on their nondominant wrist throughout the study to objectively assess movement behaviors. Spearman correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare the accelerometer measurements and self-reports for each movement behavior. Bland-Altman plots were generated to investigate trends of bias in the self-reports.
35749208#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#MEDAL may be used to assess the movement behaviors of children. Based on self-reports,, the children are able to estimate their time spent in MVPA,, inactivity,, and night sleep although actual time spent in these behaviors may differ from accelerometer-derived estimates; self-reported LPA warrant cautious interpretation. Observable differences in reporting accuracy exist between weekdays and weekend days.

35749208#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Among the participants aged 10-11 years (29/49,, 59% boys),, we observed that children reported lower light physical activity (LPA) and higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA),, inactivity,, and night sleep than that measured by the accelerometer. There was a moderate-to-strong correlation between self-reported and accelerometer-measured MVPA (r=0.37; 95% CI 0.20-0.54),, inactivity (r=0.36; 95% CI 0.18-0.54),, and night sleep (r=0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.74); the correlation for LPA was poor (r=0.19; 95% CI 0.02-0.36). Agreement was poor for all behaviors (MVPA: ICC=0.24,, 95% CI 0.07-0.40; LPA: ICC=0.19,, 95% CI 0.01-0.36; inactivity: ICC=0.29,, 95% CI 0.11-0.44; night sleep: ICC=0.45,, 95% CI 0.29-0.58). There was stronger correlation and agreement on weekdays for inactivity and night sleep; conversely,, there was stronger correlation and agreement for MVPA and LPA on weekend days. Finally,, based on Bland-Altman plots,, we observed that with increasing MVPA,, children tended to report higher MVPA than that measured by the accelerometer. There were no clear trends for the other behaviors.
26950076#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In-ambulance telemedicine is a recently developed and a promising approach to improve emergency care. We implemented the first ever 24/7 in-ambulance telemedicine service for acute stroke. We report on our experiences with the development and pilot testing of the Prehospital Stroke Study at the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (PreSSUB) to facilitate a wider spread of the knowledge regarding this technique.
26950076#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Successful execution of the project involved the development and validation of a novel stroke scale,, design and creation of specific hardware and software solutions,, execution of field tests for mobile internet connectivity,, design of new care processes and information flows,, recurrent training of all professional caregivers involved in acute stroke management,, extensive testing on healthy volunteers,, organisation of a 24/7 teleconsultation service by trained stroke experts and 24/7 technical support,, and resolution of several legal issues.
26950076#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In all,, it took 41 months of research and development to confirm the safety,, technical feasibility,, reliability,, and user acceptance of the PreSSUB approach. Stroke-specific key information can be collected safely and reliably before and during ambulance transportation and can adequately be communicated with the inhospital team awaiting the patient.
26950076#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This paper portrays the key steps required and the lessons learned for successful implementation of a 24/7 expert telemedicine service supporting patients with acute stroke during ambulance transportation to the hospital.

26216684#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Untreated epilepsy is a major global public health problem with more than 20 million people not being treated for an easily treatable disease. In part this is due to a lack of trained doctors. There are many more non-medical health workers than doctors and they could have an important role in diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy if they had some tools. We have previously described such a tool to distinguish epileptic episodes from other causes of altered consciousness and here present its validation in three new populations.
26216684#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The tool was presented as a phone app where the answers to 11 questions provided a probability score which indicated whether episodes might be due to epilepsy or not. It was applied either by non-medical volunteers,, health workers,, or inexperienced doctors to 132 patients in three separate populations in India and Nepal and compared with the "gold standard" diagnosis of a neurologist with expertise in epilepsy.
26216684#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There was good agreement between the app score and the neurologists' diagnoses (weighted kappa=75.3%). An app score of 90 or greater had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing epilepsy. The app was easy to use with little training and took about 5min to administer.
26216684#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A tool presented as a phone app can be used by non-medical health workers to identify episodes as epileptic or not with good accuracy. It needs to be evaluated more widely but has the potential to play a part in reducing the epilepsy treatment gap.

35451981#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Portfolio Diet,, or Dietary Portfolio,, is a therapeutic dietary pattern that combines cholesterol-lowering foods to manage dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. To translate the Portfolio Diet for primary care,, we developed the PortfolioDiet.app as a patient and physician educational and engagement tool for PCs and smartphones. The PortfolioDiet.app is currently being used as an add-on therapy to the standard of care (usual care) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in primary care. To enhance the adoption of this tool,, it is important to ensure that the PortfolioDiet.app meets the needs of its target end users.
35451981#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The main objective of this project is to undertake user testing to inform modifications to the PortfolioDiet.app as part of ongoing engagement in quality improvement (QI).
35451981#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#By undertaking user testing of the PortfolioDiet.app,, its limitations and strengths were able to be identified,, informing modifications to the application,, which resulted in a clinical tool that better meets users' needs. The PortfolioDiet.app educates users on the Portfolio Diet and is considered acceptable by users. Although further refinements to the PortfolioDiet.app will continue to be made before its evaluation in a clinical trial,, the result of this QI project is an improved clinical tool.

35451981#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We undertook a 2-phase QI project from February 2021 to September 2021. We recruited users by convenience sampling. Users included patients,, family physicians,, and dietitians,, as well as nutrition and medical students. For both phases,, users were asked to use the PortfolioDiet.app daily for 7 days. In phase 1,, a mixed-form questionnaire was administered to evaluate the users' perceived acceptability,, knowledge acquisition,, and engagement with the PortfolioDiet.app. The questionnaire collected both quantitative and qualitative data,, including 2 open-ended questions. The responses were used to inform modifications to the PortfolioDiet.app. In phase 2,, the System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of the updated PortfolioDiet.app,, with a score higher than 70 being considered acceptable.
35451981#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 30 and 19 users were recruited for phase 1 and phase 2,, respectively. In phase 1,, the PortfolioDiet.app increased users' perceived knowledge of the Portfolio Diet and influenced their perceived food choices. Limitations identified by users included challenges navigating to resources and profile settings,, limited information on plant sterols,, inaccuracies in points,, timed-logout frustration,, request for step-by-step pop-up windows,, and request for a mobile app version; when looking at positive feedback,, the recipe section was the most commonly praised feature. Between the project phases,, 6 modifications were made to the PortfolioDiet.app to incorporate and address user feedback. At phase 2,, the average System Usability Scale score was 85.39 (SD 11.47),, with 100 being the best possible.
30104186#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A growing body of evidence supports the use of lifestyle interventions for preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia in at-risk individuals. The development of internet-delivered programs would increase the scalability and reach of these interventions,, but requires validation to ensure similar effectiveness to brick-and-mortar options.
30104186#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We describe the study design,, recruitment process,, and baseline participant characteristics of the sample in the Virtual Cognitive Health (VC Health) study. Future analyses will assess the impact of the remotely delivered lifestyle intervention on (1) cognitive function,, (2) depression and anxiety,, and (3) various lifestyle behaviors,, including diet,, exercise,, and sleep,, in a cohort of older adults with subjective memory decline. Additional analyses will explore feasibility outcomes,, as well as the participants' engagement patterns with the program.
30104186#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 85 participants enrolled in the intervention and 82 are included in the study sample (3 participants withdrew). The study cohort of 82 participants comprises 61 (74%) female,, 72 (88%) white,, and 64 (78%) overweight or obese participants,, and 55 (67%) have at least a college degree. The average baseline RBANS score was 95.9 (SD 11.1),, which is within age-adjusted norms. The average SCD-9 score was 6.0 (SD 2.0),, indicating minor subjective cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. The average baseline Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale score was 6.2 (SD 4.5),, and the average Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item score was 8.5 (SD 4.9),, indicating mild levels of anxiety and depression at baseline.

30104186#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Older adults (aged 60-75 years) with subjective memory decline as measured by the Subjective Cognitive Decline 9-item (SCD-9) questionnaire,, and who reported feeling worried about their memory decline,, were eligible to participate in this single-arm pre-post study. All participants enrolled in the yearlong digital intervention,, which consists of health coach-guided lifestyle change for improving diet,, exercise,, sleep,, stress,, and cognition. All components of this study were conducted remotely,, including the collection of data and the administration of the intervention. We assessed participants at baseline,, 12 weeks,, 24 weeks,, and 52 weeks with online surveys and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test. We will conduct intention-to-treat analysis on all outcomes.
30104186#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Internet-delivered lifestyle interventions are a scalable solution for the prevention or delay of Alzheimer disease. The results of this study will provide the first evidence for the effectiveness of a fully remote intervention and lay the groundwork for future investigations.

32955442#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To deploy the system in a nonsupervised environment,, extensive functional testing of the platform was conducted,, together with a validation of the tablet-based tests. Such validation had the two-fold aim of evaluating system usability and acceptance and investigating the concurrent validity of computerized assessment compared with the corresponding paper-and-pencil counterparts.
32955442#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results obtained from 83 older adults showed high system acceptance,, despite the patients' low familiarity with technology. The system software was successfully validated. A concurrent validation of the system reported good ability of the digitized tests to retain the same predictive power of the corresponding paper-based tests.
32955442#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Altogether,, the positive results pave the way for the deployment of the system to a nonsupervised environment,, thus representing a potential efficacious and ecological solution to support clinicians in the identification of early signs of cognitive decline.

33805690#ABSTRACT##In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic,, Remote Patient Monitoring technologies are highly important for clinicians and researchers. These connected-health technologies enable monitoring of patients and facilitate remote clinical trial research while reducing the potential for the spread of the novel coronavirus. There is a growing requirement for monitoring of the full 24 h spectrum of behaviours with a single research-grade sensor. This research describes a free-living and supervised protocol comparison study of the Verisense inertial measurement unit to assess physical activity and sleep parameters and compares it with the Actiwatch 2 actigraph. Fifteen adults (11 males,, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 4 females,, 29 ± 12.6 years) wore both monitors for 2 consecutive days and nights in the free-living study while twelve adults (11 males,, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 1 female,, 22 ± 0 years) wore both monitors for the duration of a gym-based supervised protocol study. Agreement of physical activity epoch-by-epoch data with activity classification of sedentary,, light and moderate-to-vigorous activity and sleep metrics were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. For all activity,, Verisense showed high agreement for both free-living and supervised protocol of r = 0.85 and r = 0.78,, respectively. For physical activity classification,, Verisense showed high agreement of sedentary activity of r = 0.72 for free-living but low agreement of r = 0.36 for supervised protocol; low agreement of light activity of r = 0.42 for free-living and negligible agreement of r = -0.04 for supervised protocol; and moderate agreement of moderate-to-vigorous activity of r = 0.52 for free-living with low agreement of r = 0.49 for supervised protocol. For sleep metrics,, Verisense showed moderate agreement for sleep time and total sleep time of r = 0.66 and 0.54,, respectively,, but demonstrated high agreement for determination of wake time of r = 0.83. Overall,, our results showed moderate-high agreement of Verisense with Actiwatch 2 for assessing epoch-by-epoch physical activity and sleep,, but a lack of agreement for activity classifications. Future validation work of Verisense for activity cut-point potentially holds promise for 24 h continuous remote patient monitoring.

32423358#ABSTRACT##Background:Atrial fibrillation (AF),, the most common cardiac arrhythmia,, can be detected by smartphones and smartwatches.Introduction:Single-lead ECGs (iECGs) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors provide the opportunity for a broad,, simple,, and easily repeatable cardiac rhythm analysis. To reduce unnecessary medical follow-up testing due to false positive results,, our aim was to find a screening approach applicable on smart devices with a focus on high specificity.Methods:We used PPG measurements from smartphones and smartwatches and iECG data from two previous validation trials. Two AF detection algorithms (A and B) were applied on the iECG dataset and compared directly. Further,, we used 1-min PPG measurements as a first-pass filter for arrhythmia detection and simulated a sequential testing: Once an arrhythmia was detected in the PPG,, the iECG counterpart of the patient was analyzed by algorithm A,, B,, or A?+?B combined although algorithm B was primarily designed for PPG analysis.Results:The iECGs from 1,,288 participants were analyzed. Algorithm A did not show a diagnosis in 16.1%. In the remaining,, sensitivity and specificity were 99.6%,, and 97.4% respectively. Accuracy was 98.5%,, and correct classification rate (CCR) was 82.7%. Algorithm B always differentiated between normal and arrhythmic and reached an overall sensitivity of 95.4%,, a specificity of 91.6%,, and an accuracy and CCR of 93.3%. Sequential testing by combining both algorithms into a three-phase test (Test positive PPG,, then iECG analysis by A and B combined) resulted in a 100% specificity.Conclusion:Algorithm B performed strongly in PPG analysis as well as iECG analysis. PPG signals and consecutive iECG combined when an arrhythmia was detected by PPG resulted in a specificity that was higher than 99%.Discussion:The analysis allows a direct comparison of iECG algorithms without possible dilution by different measurement procedures or recording-devices. We improved specificity in AF-screening approaches with wearables by simulating a novel approach. Results rely on signal quality.

31530602#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Equity in health and access to healthcare regardless of gender,, ethnicity or social position is a major political issue worldwide. Regardless of an individual's knowledge,, motivation and competence,, individuals are expected to be engaged and take responsibility of their own care. Migrants have been identified as a vulnerable population in healthcare,, and an explanation for the inequity in health and in healthcare is limited health literacy. Furthermore,, with increasing digitalisation in healthcare,, it also puts demand on the individual to have digital or electronic health (eHealth) literacy.The overall aim of this study is to conduct a psychometric evaluation of the Swedish and Arabic versions of HLS-EU-Q16 and eHEALS and to compare Arabic and Swedish speakers' Health literacy and eHealth literacy levels in Sweden.
31530602#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND ANALYSIS# and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. To assess associations between HLS-EU-Q16,, eHEALS and demographic variables,, binary logistic regression analyses will be performed.
31530602#ABSTRACT#ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION#The project has been approved by the regional ethical review board in Stockholm,, Sweden (2019/5:1) and will follow the principles outlined in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Results from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals,, scientific conferences and social media.

32424997#ABSTRACT#AIM#Best practice management for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves regular clinical assessment of RA disease activity. This is not achievable with current rheumatology systems of care. We aimed to use opinions from people with RA and their specialist rheumatology healthcare professionals to inform development of a mobile app for people with RA for recording their disease activity data for potential integration into clinical service,, and assess usability of the app.
32424997#ABSTRACT#METHOD#In phase 1 we interviewed nine people with RA and seven healthcare professionals. In phase 2 we developed an app with professional software developers. In phase 3 we evaluated app usability for people with RA using the System Usability Scale (SUS).
32424997#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Interview data showed four themes regarding functionality and implementation of a patient-held app in RA care: (a) variable app acceptance and readiness; (b) app use to reduce barriers; (c) pros and cons of patient-reported outcomes; and (d) allocation of clinics by need. The app developed has high usability in people with RA using the app on their own device for a month (SUS 79.5,, n = 16) or using the app on a study device for 10 minutes (SUS 83,, n = 100).
32424997#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#People with RA and healthcare professionals have clearly identified features,, benefits and risks of an app for self-assessment of RA and incorporation into clinical care. An app developed informed by these opinions has high usability. Next steps are development and validation of a method of patient-performed joint counts,, and implementation,, with evaluation,, in the clinical setting.

33403107#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The private health sector is an important source of sick child care,, yet evidence gaps persist in best practices for integrated management of private sector child health services. Further,, there is no prioritized research agenda to address these gaps. We used a Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) process to identify priority research questions in response to these evidence gaps. CHNRI is a consultative approach that entails prioritizing research questions by evaluating them against standardized criteria.
33403107#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We engaged geographically and occupationally diverse experts in the private health sector and child health. Eighty-nine experts agreed to participate and provided 150 priority research questions. We consolidated submitted questions to reduce duplication into a final list of 50. We asked participants to complete an online survey to rank each question against 11 pre-determined criteria in four categories: (i) answerability,, (ii) research feasibility,, (iii) sustainability/equity,, and (iv) importance/potential impact. Statistical data analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc,, Cary NC,, USA). We weighted all 11 evaluation criteria equally to calculate the research priority score and average expert agreement for each question. We disaggregated results by location in high-income vs low- and middle-income countries.
33403107#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Forty-nine participants (55.1%) completed the online survey,, including 33 high-income and 16 low- and middle-income country respondents. The top,, prioritized research question asks whether accreditation or regulation of private clinical and non-clinical sources of care would improve integrated management of childhood illness services. Four of the top ten research priorities were related to adherence to case management protocols. Other top research priorities were related to training and supportive supervision,, digital health,, and infant and newborn care. Research priorities among high-income and low- and middle-income country respondents were highly correlated.
33403107#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#To our knowledge,, this is the first systematic exercise conducted to define research priorities for the management of childhood illness in the private sector. The research priorities put forth in this CHNRI exercise aim to stimulate interest from policy makers,, program managers,, researchers,, and donors to respond to and help close evidence gaps hindering the acceleration of reductions in child mortality through private sector approaches.

31471959#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Blockchain has the potential to disrupt the current modes of patient data access,, accumulation,, contribution,, exchange,, and control. Using interoperability standards,, smart contracts,, and cryptographic identities,, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive,, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike.
31471959#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This work presents HealthChain,, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement,, data curation,, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure,, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources,, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition,, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore,, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable,, smart contracts,, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally,, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security.
31471959#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care,, namely,, information security,, interoperability,, data integrity,, identity validation,, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source,, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption,, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records.
31471959#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results indicate several clear high-performing,, low-bandwidth configurations,, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models,, one's anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific,, Advanced Encryption Standard-encrypted data with static keys,, incremental server storage,, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive,, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys,, incremental server storage,, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations.
31471959#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information. By integrating a structured,, interoperable design with patient-accumulated and generated data shared through smart contracts into a universally accessible blockchain,, HealthChain presents patients and providers with access to consistent and comprehensive medical records. Challenges addressed include data security,, interoperability,, block storage,, and patient-administered data access,, with several configurations emerging for further consideration regarding speed and security.

29133284#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In the last decade,, electronic health (eHealth) literacy has attracted the attention of the scientific community,, as it is associated with the self-management of patients with chronic diseases and the quality and cost of care. It is estimated that 80% of people with chronic diseases are cared for at home by a family member,, friend,, or relative. Informal carers are susceptible to physical and mental health problems,, as well as social and financial hardships. Nevertheless,, there seems to be a research gap in terms of carers' needs,, skills,, and available resources in the age of new technologies,, with the vital role of eHealth literacy of the carers remaining unexplored.
29133284#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to investigate the level of eHealth literacy and health literacy of primary and secondary carers of people with dementia,, to explore the association between health and eHealth literacy,, as well as their association with the caregiving variables: self-efficacy,, coping,, and caring perceptions.
29133284#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#As a preliminary study,, the HLS-EU-Q16 has been validated in 107 older people. The internal consistency of the scale as estimated using Cronbach alpha coefficient was .77,, somewhat lower than other validation studies. Recruitment of pilot study participants started in May 2017.
29133284#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Carers' eHealth literacy is a new field. Whereas previous studies have focused on the role and impact of low eHealth literacy and health literacy among older adults,, the eHealth literacy of carers,, and in fact carers of people with dementia,, has not been explored. We hypothesize an association between eHealth literacy and health literacy level with carers' perceptions about caregiving role,, self-efficacy,, and coping strategies. A possible moderator in these associations is the secondary carers' eHealth and health literacy level,, which will also be explored. By confirming the above hypotheses,, tailored eHealth literacy interventions for carers of people with dementia and their families will be developed as a direct outcome of this research.

29133284#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A sample of 200 primary carers (the carer who supports the people with dementia in everyday living) and 200 secondary carers (family member,, friend,, or other person in the social network assisting the primary carer in their role) will be recruited from dementia day care centers and Alzheimer's associations in Greece and Cyprus. The study will be a cross-sectional correlational descriptive study. Tools to be used include the eHealth Literacy Scale adapted for carers to measure eHealth literacy,, European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire 16 (HLS-EU-Q16),, Single Item Literacy Screener,, Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy,, Carers of Older People in Europe (COPE) index for caregiving perceptions,, and COPE brief to measure selected coping strategies. Descriptive statistics will be reported,, and correlations between different variables will be explored with parametric and nonparametric measures.

31847753#ABSTRACT##Background and Purpose- The increasing demand and shortage of experts to evaluate and treat acute stroke patients has led to the development of remote communication tools to aid stroke management. We aimed to evaluate the JOIN App smartphone system-a low-cost tool for rapid clinical and neuroimaging data sharing to expedite decision-making in stroke. Methods- Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients treated at a University Hospital in Brazil from December 2014 to December 2015 were evaluated. The analysis included all patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke who underwent initial evaluation by neurology residents followed by JOIN teleconsultation with a stroke neurologist on call for management decisions. An expert panel of stroke neurologists and neuroradiologists revised all cases using a standard Picture Archiving and Communication System imaging workstation within 24 hours and analyzed the decision made with remote assistance during the emergency setting. Results- A total of 720 stroke codes were evaluated with 442 acute ischemic stroke qualifying. Seventy-eight (18%) patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis. The main reasons for tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) exclusion were symptom onset >4.5 hours (n=295; 67%) and hypodense middle cerebral artery territory area >1/3 (n=31; 7%). The agreement rates between Picture Archiving and Communication System versus JOIN-based thrombolysis decisions were 100% for the stroke (unblinded) and 99.3% for the neuroradiologist (blinded) experts. The use of the application resulted in a significant reduction in the door-to-needle times across the pre- versus postimplementation periods (median,, 90 [interquartile range,, 75-106] versus 63 [interquartile range,, 61-117] minutes; P=0.03). The rates of 90-day excellent outcomes (modified Rankin Scale,, 0-1) were 51.3%; 90-day mortality,, 2.6%; and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage,, 3.8%. Conclusions- The JOIN smartphone system allows rapid sharing of clinical and imaging data to facilitate decisions for stroke treatment. The remote application-based decisions seem to be as accurate as the physical presence of stroke experts and might lead to faster times to treatment. This system represents an easily implementable low-cost telemedicine solution for centers that cannot afford the full-time presence of stroke specialists.

35037895#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Due to the limitations of existing measures for this purpose,, we aimed to develop and validate a novel well-being index for digital use,, to capture symptoms of common mental health problems and key aspects of positive well-being.
35037895#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In Study 1A,, questionnaire items were generated by clinicians and screened for face validity. In Study 1B,, these items were presented to a large sample (n=1104) of UK adults,, and exploratory factor analysis was used to reduce the item pool and identify coherent subscales. In Study 2,, the final measure was presented to a new nationally representative UK sample (n=976),, along with a battery of existing measures,, with 238 participants retaking the Umind Index after 1 week. The factor structure and measurement invariance of the Unmind Index was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis,, convergent and discriminant validity by estimating correlations with existing measures,, and reliability by examining internal consistency and test-retest intraclass correlations.
35037895#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Studies 1A and 1B yielded a 26-item measure with 7 subscales: Calmness,, Connection,, Coping,, Happiness,, Health,, Fulfilment,, and Sleep. Study 2 showed that the Unmind Index is fitted well by a second-order factor structure,, where the 7 subscales all load onto an overall MHWB factor,, and established measurement invariance by age and gender. Subscale and total scores correlate well with existing mental health measures and generally diverge from personality measures. Reliability was good or excellent across all subscales.
35037895#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Unmind Index is a robust measure of MHWB that can help to identify target areas for intervention in nonclinical users of a mental health app. We argue that there is value in measuring mental ill health and mental well-being together,, rather than treating them as separate constructs.

33825685#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We mapped the dispersion of leprosy incidence in Brazil from 2014 to 2018,, and found a particularly high number of cases in central Brazil in 2014 that further increased in 2018 in the state of Mato Grosso. For some municipalities,, up to 80% of cases showed some data discrepancy. Of a total of 21,,047 discrepancies detected,, the most common was "operational classification does not match the clinical form." After data processing,, we identified a total of 77,,628 cases with missing data. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI model applied for the operational classification of leprosy was 93.97% and 87.09%,, respectively.
33825685#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed app was able to recognize patterns in leprosy cases registered in the SINAN database and to classify new patients with paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy,, thereby reducing the probability of incorrect assignment by health centers. The collection and notification of data on leprosy in Brazil seem to lack specific validation to increase the quality of the data for implementations via AI. The AI models implemented in this work had satisfactory accuracy across Brazilian states and could be a complementary diagnosis tool,, especially in remote areas with few specialist physicians.

32570521#ABSTRACT##Painful conditions are prevalent and substantially contribute to disability worldwide. Digital manikins are body-shaped drawings to facilitate self-reporting of pain. Some of them have been validated,, but without allowing for recording of location-specific pain intensity and for use on a smartphone. This paper describes the initial development of a digital pain manikin to support self-reporting of pain location and location-specific intensity using people's own mobile device. Subsequently,, we conducted reliability and usability tests with eight researchers and seven patient representatives. Test-retest reliability depended on the manikin's level of detail,, but was generally high with most intraclass correlation coefficients âLe0.70 and all similarity coefficients âLe0.50. Participants found the manikin easy to use,, but suggested clearer orientation (front/back,, certain body locations) and would value additional feedback and diary functions. We will address these issues in the next version of the manikin before conducting a validation study.

33825685#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#According to the World Health Organization,, achieving targets for control of leprosy by 2030 will require disease elimination and interruption of transmission at the national or regional level. India and Brazil have reported the highest leprosy burden in the last few decades,, revealing the need for strategies and tools to help health professionals correctly manage and control the disease.
33825685#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The main objective of this study was to develop a cross-platform app for leprosy screening based on artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of increasing accessibility of an accurate method of classifying leprosy treatment for health professionals,, especially for communities further away from major diagnostic centers. Toward this end,, we analyzed the quality of leprosy data in Brazil on the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN).
33825685#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Leprosy data were extracted from the SINAN database,, carefully cleaned,, and used to build AI decision models based on the random forest algorithm to predict operational classification in paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy. We used Python programming language to extract and clean the data,, and R programming language to train and test the AI model via cross-validation. To allow broad access,, we deployed the final random forest classification model in a web app via shinyApp using data available from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System.

24974373#ABSTRACT##The European Commission recently published the first calls for proposals for the Horizon 2020 (H2020) work programme for research and innovation. When browsing through the Health programme,, it became apparent that the work programme made little reference to environmental health research. In this commentary we describe major milestones of environmental health research in previous European Framework Programmes and the policy shift that took place when preparing H2020. We introduce mobile health technologies as a niche innovation to reconcile the environmental health research arena with the H2020 programme that has a clear focus on ICT. The recent economic crises urged strong policy action to reinforce Europe's economic and innovation leadership. Market-driven and job-creating ambitions became primary goals of H2020. Environmental health-related keywords referring to,, e.g. human biomonitoring,, exposure assessment or exposome are absent in the current H2020-calls and this may suggest a lack of opportunities for environmental health researchers. Technologies related to mobile healthcare (mhealth) are rapidly maturing and offer new research and market opportunities. In a typically technology-pushed market,, these sensor technologies however require validation by a third-party and implementation in large-scale public health monitoring studies. Also,, issues related to data protection need further development to warrant user rights and privacy. If the European environmental health research arena succeeds in embracing these new mhealth sensor technologies,, it may not only create an opportunity to play a role as a key innovation partner in health transition technologies,, but it may also support authorities to realize a transition in our healthcare with a much bigger emphasis on a preventive and sustainable system.

During interviews,, participants expressed a preference for the app over a paper version of the PACSLAC-II due to reasons such as the app's ability to summarize information. Utilization of the community portal websites was unrelated to staff questionnaire-assessed stress/burnout.

34886468#ABSTRACT##The COVID-19 pandemic created a globally shared stressor that saw a rise in the emphasis on mental and emotional wellbeing. However,, historically,, these topics were not openly discussed,, leaving those struggling without professional support. One powerful tool to bridge the gap and facilitate connectedness during times of isolation is online health communities (OHCs). This study surveyed Health Union OHC members during the pandemic to determine the degree of COVID-19 concern,, social isolation,, and mental health distress they are facing,, as well as to assess where they are receiving information about COVID-19 and what sources of support they desire. The survey was completed in six independent waves between March 2020 and April 2021,, and garnered 10,,177 total responses. In the United States,, OHCs were utilized significantly more during peak lockdown times,, and the desire for emotional and/or mental health support increased over time. Open-ended responses demonstrated a strong desire for connection and validation,, which are quintessential characteristics of OHCs. Through active moderation utilizing trained moderators,, OHCs can provide a powerful,, intermediate and safe space where conversations about mental and emotional wellbeing can be normalized and those in need are encouraged to seek additional assistance from healthcare professionals if warranted.

36546682#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#A tablet app,, based on the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate-II (PACSLAC-II),, has been shown to have clinical utility and unique advantages. We aimed to replicate and extend the previous validation of the app through the implementation and evaluation of a new community platform involving a quality indicator (QI) monitoring feature and a resource community portal (CP) that work in conjunction with an updated version of the app.
36546682#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We employed a mixed-methods multiple-baseline design across 11 long-term care (LTC) units. Units were randomly assigned to conditions which varied in number of app features available. Data included unit-level QIs as well as questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with health professionals.
36546682#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the positive effects on the care of residents,, the COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges and interfered with the long-term maintenance of the QI results.

26481906#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to explore patient and provider attitudes and interest in a proposed clinic-based tablet system for personal health information exchange. To provide a context to understand patients' use of tablets during their clinic visit,, we also examine patients' current activities and time spent in the waiting room,, and their use of health information resources.
26481906#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Surveys were administered to 84 patients in the waiting room of a community health center affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston,, MA. This survey included a vignette and illustration describing a proposed tablet-based system in which the patient,, upon sign in at the clinic,, receives a tablet loaded with personalized information tailored to their specific medical conditions and preferences. Patients were queried about their interest in such a system in comparison to traditional forms of patient education as well as their current health information seeking behaviors and activities and time spent in the waiting room. Interviews with five MGH-affiliated health care providers were conducted to assess their opinions regarding the proposed tablet system.
26481906#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The majority (>60%) of patients were "very" or "extremely" interested in the proposed tablet system and thought it would improve their knowledge about their medical condition (60%),, assist them in making healthy choices (57%),, and help them to feel more comfortable talking with their provider (55%). Patients thought the system would be more motivating,, informative,, and engaging than traditional printed health education materials. The tablet system was not considered more effective than face-to-face interaction with providers,, though 44% thought it would improve their relationship with their physician. Overall,, 91% of respondents were willing to learn how to use a tablet and 75% reported being "very" or "extremely" confident they could use one. Four of the five providers believed that the proposed tablet system would improve clinical workflow and patient education. Patients and providers were concerned about privacy and security of data collected using the tablets.
26481906#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Both patients and providers were highly amenable to integrating tablets into the clinical experience,, and tablets may be useful in improving patients' health knowledge,, the collection of patient reported outcome measures,, and improved patient-provider communication. Further research into operationalizing such systems and their validation is necessary before integration into standard clinical practice.

33779574#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In recent years,, mobile-based interventions have received more attention as an alternative to on-site obesity management. Despite increased mobile interventions for obesity,, there are lost opportunities to achieve better outcomes due to the lack of a predictive model using current existing longitudinal and cross-sectional health data. Noom (Noom Inc) is a mobile app that provides various lifestyle-related logs including food logging,, exercise logging,, and weight logging.
33779574#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop a weight change predictive model using an interpretable artificial intelligence algorithm for mobile-based interventions and to explore contributing factors to weight loss.
33779574#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Lifelog mobile app (Noom) user data of individuals who used the weight loss program for 16 weeks in the United States were used to develop an interpretable recurrent neural network algorithm for weight prediction that considers both time-variant and time-fixed variables. From a total of 93,,696 users in the coaching program,, we excluded users who did not take part in the 16-week weight loss program or who were not overweight or obese or had not entered weight or meal records for the entire 16-week program. This interpretable model was trained and validated with 5-fold cross-validation (training set: 70%; testing: 30%) using the lifelog data. Mean absolute percentage error between actual weight loss and predicted weight was used to measure model performance. To better understand the behavior factors contributing to weight loss or gain,, we calculated contribution coefficients in test sets.
33779574#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 17,,867 users' data were included in the analysis. The overall mean absolute percentage error of the model was 3.50%,, and the error of the model declined from 3.78% to 3.45% by the end of the program. The time-level attention weighting was shown to be equally distributed at 0.0625 each week,, but this gradually decreased (from 0.0626 to 0.0624) as it approached 16 weeks. Factors such as usage pattern,, weight input frequency,, meal input adherence,, exercise,, and sharp decreases in weight trajectories had negative contribution coefficients of -0.021,, -0.032,, -0.015,, and -0.066,, respectively. For time-fixed variables,, being male had a contribution coefficient of -0.091.
33779574#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#An interpretable algorithm,, with both time-variant and time-fixed data,, was used to precisely predict weight loss while preserving model transparency. This week-to-week prediction model is expected to improve weight loss and provide a global explanation of contributing factors,, leading to better outcomes.

29459356#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic health (eHealth) literacy is needed to effectively engage with Web-based health resources. The 8-item eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) is a commonly used self-report measure of eHealth literacy. Accumulated evidence has suggested that the eHEALS is unidimensional. However,, a recent study by Sudbury-Riley and colleagues suggested that a theoretically-informed three-factor model fit better than a one-factor model. The 3 factors identified were awareness (2 items),, skills (3 items),, and evaluate (3 items). It is important to determine whether these findings can be replicated in other populations.
29459356#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this cross-sectional study was to verify the three-factor eHEALS structure among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) medical imaging outpatients.
29459356#ABSTRACT#METHODS#MRI and CT outpatients were recruited consecutively in the waiting room of one major public hospital. Participants self-completed a touchscreen computer survey,, assessing their sociodemographic,, scan,, and internet use characteristics. The eHEALS was administered to internet users,, and the three-factor structure was tested using structural equation modeling.
29459356#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=11.3; SRMR=.013; CFI=.999; RMSEA=.011).
29459356#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The three-factor eHEALS structure was supported in this sample of MRI and CT medical imaging outpatients. Although further factorial validation studies are needed,, these 3 scale factors may be used to identify individuals who could benefit from interventions to improve eHealth literacy awareness,, skill,, and evaluation competencies.

27234926#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Poor nutrition and lifestyle behaviors exert detrimental effects on reproduction and health during the life course. Therefore,, lifestyle interventions during the periconceptional period can improve fertility,, pregnancy outcome,, and health of subsequent generations.
27234926#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This survey investigates the compliance,, usability,, and initial effectiveness of the Web-based mHealth platform,, Smarter Pregnancy.
27234926#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A free subscription to the mHealth platform,, Smarter Pregnancy,, was provided to couples contemplating pregnancy (n=1275) or already pregnant (n=603). After baseline identification of inadequate nutrition and lifestyle behaviors,, a personal online coaching program of 6 months was generated. Using multiple imputation and the generalized estimating equation model with independent correlations,, we estimated the changes from inadequate to adequate nutrition and lifestyle behaviors over time. Subgroup analyses were performed for (1) overweight and obese women (body mass index [BMI] =25 kg/m(2)),, (2) pregnant women at the start of the program,, and (3) couples.
27234926#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This novel Web-based mHealth platform shows high compliance and usability,, and users demonstrate improvements in nutrition and lifestyle behaviors. The next step will be further validation in randomized controlled trials and implementation.

28553675#ABSTRACT##Physical activity helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,, hypertension and obesity. The ability to monitor a person's daily activity level can inform self-management of physical activity and related interventions. For older adults with obesity,, the importance of regular,, physical activity is critical to reduce the risk of long-term disability. In this work,, we present ActivityAware,, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that measures daily activity levels (sedentary,, moderate and vigorous) of individuals,, continuously and in real-time. The app implements an activity-level detection model,, continuously collects acceleration data on the Amulet,, classifies the current activity level,, updates the day's accumulated time spent at that activity level,, logs the data for later analysis,, and displays the results on the screen. We developed an activity-level detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained our classifiers using data from a user study,, where subjects performed the following physical activities: sit,, stand,, lay down,, walk and run. With 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross validation,, we obtained preliminary results that suggest accuracies up to 98%,, for n=14 subjects. Testing the ActivityAware app revealed a projected battery life of up to 4 weeks before needing to recharge. The results are promising,, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring,, and eventually for the development of interventions that could improve the health of individuals.

35793132#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The usability of mobile health (mHealth) apps needs to be effectively evaluated before they are officially approved to be used to deliver health interventions. To this end,, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) has been designed and proved valid and reliable in assessing the usability of mHealth apps. However,, this English questionnaire needs to be translated into other languages,, adapted,, and validated before being utilized to evaluate the usability of mHealth apps.
35793132#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to improve,, further adapt,, and validate the Chinese version of the MAUQ (C-MAUQ; interactive for patients) on Left-handed Doctor,, one of the most popular "reaching out to patients" interactive mHealth apps with chatbot function in China,, to test the reliability and cross-cultural adaptability of the questionnaire.
35793132#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The MAUQ (interactive for patients) has been translated into Chinese and validated for its reliability on Good Doctor,, one of the most influential "reaching out to patients" mHealth apps without chatbot function in China. After asking for the researchers' approval to use this Chinese version,, we adjusted and further adapted the C-MAUQ by checking it against the original English version and improving its comprehensibility,, readability,, idiomaticity,, and cross-cultural adaptability. Following a trial survey completed by 50 respondents on wenjuanxing,, the most popular online questionnaire platform in China,, the improved version of the C-MAUQ (I-C-MAUQ) was finally used to evaluate the usability of Left-handed Doctor through an online questionnaire survey (answered by 322 participants) on wenjuanxing,, to test its internal consistency,, reliability,, and validity.
35793132#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The I-C-MAUQ still retained the 21 items and 3 dimensions of the original MAUQ: 8 items for usability and satisfaction,, 6 items for system information arrangement,, and 7 items for efficiency. The translation problems in the C-MAUQ,, including (1) redundancy,, (2) incompleteness,, (3) misuse of parts of speech,, (4) choice of inappropriate words,, (5) incomprehensibility,, and (6) cultural difference-induced improper translation,, were improved. As shown in the analysis of data obtained through the online survey,, the I-C-MAUQ had a better internal consistency (ie,, the correlation coefficient between the score of each item and the total score of the questionnaire determined within the range of 0.861-0.938; P<.01),, reliability (Cronbach a=.988),, and validity (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.973),, compared with the C-MAUQ. It was effectively used to test the usability of Left-handed Doctor,, eliciting over 80% of informants' positive attitudes toward this mHealth app.

35793132#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The I-C-MAUQ is highly reliable and valid for Left-handed Doctor,, and suitable for testing the usability of interactive mHealth apps used by patients in China. This finding further confirms the cross-cultural validity,, reliability,, and adaptability of the MAUQ. We identified certain factors influencing the perceived usability of mHealth apps,, including users' age,, gender,, education,, profession,, and possibly previous experience with mHealth apps and the chatbot function of such apps. Most notably,, we found a wider acceptance of this new technology among young Chinese female college students who were more engaged in the interaction with health care chatbots. The age-,, gender-,, and profession-induced preference for new digital health interventions in China aligns with the findings in other similar studies in America and Malaysia. This preference identifies areas for further research on the social,, cultural,, and gender adaptation of health technologies.

33442578#ABSTRACT##Health care has had to adapt rapidly to COVID-19,, and this in turn has highlighted a pressing need for tools to facilitate remote visits and monitoring. Digital health technology,, including body-worn devices,, offers a solution using digital outcomes to measure and monitor disease status and provide outcomes meaningful to both patients and health care professionals. Remote monitoring of physical mobility is a prime example,, because mobility is among the most advanced modalities that can be assessed digitally and remotely. Loss of mobility is also an important feature of many health conditions,, providing a read-out of health as well as a target for intervention. Real-world,, continuous digital measures of mobility (digital mobility outcomes or DMOs) provide an opportunity for novel insights into health care conditions complementing existing mobility measures. Accepted and approved DMOs are not yet widely available. The need for large collaborative efforts to tackle the critical steps to adoption is widely recognised. Mobilise-D is an example. It is a multidisciplinary consortium of 34 institutions from academia and industry funded through the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. Members of Mobilise-D are collaborating to address the critical steps for DMOs to be adopted in clinical trials and ultimately health care. To achieve this,, the consortium has developed a roadmap to inform the development,, validation and approval of DMOs in Parkinson's disease,, multiple sclerosis,, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recovery from proximal femoral fracture. Here we aim to describe the proposed approach and provide a high-level view of the ongoing and planned work of the Mobilise-D consortium. Ultimately,, Mobilise-D aims to stimulate widespread adoption of DMOs through the provision of device agnostic software,, standards and robust validation in order to bring digital outcomes from concept to use in clinical trials and health care.

24633310#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Patients often fail to adhere to clinical recommendations when using current blood pressure self-measurement (BPSM) methods and equipment. As existing BPSM equipment is not able to detect non-adherent behavior,, this could result in misdiagnosis and treatment error. To overcome this problem,, we suggest introducing an alternative method for achieving reliable BPSM by measuring additional context meta-data for validating patient adherence. To facilitate this,, we have developed ValidAid,, a context-aware system for determining patient adherence levels during BPSM.
24633310#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#The aim of this study was to validate this new reliable BPSM method based on ValidAid in the clinical setting. Specifically,, we wanted to evaluate ValidAid's ability to accurately detect and model patient adherence levels during BPSM in the clinic.
24633310#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The validation was done by asking 41 pregnant diabetic patients scheduled for self-measuring their blood pressure (BP) in the waiting room at an obstetrics department's outpatient clinic to perform an additional BPSM using ValidAid. We then compared the automatically measured and classified values from ValidAid with our manual observations.
24633310#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We found that a) the pregnant diabetics did not adhere to given instructions when performing BPSM in the waiting room,, and that b) the ValidAid system was able to accurately classify patient adherence to the modeled recommendations.
24633310#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A new method for ensuring reliable BPSM based on the ValidAid system was validated. Results indicate that context-aware technology is useful for accurately modeling important aspects of non-adherent patient behavior. This may be used to identify patients in need of additional training,, or to design better aids to actively assist the patients during measurements. ValidAid is also applicable to other self-measurement environments including the home setting and outpatient clinics in remote or underserved areas as it is built using telemedicine technology and thus well-suited for remote monitoring and diagnosis.

36753308#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There is an extensive library of language tests,, each with excellent psychometric properties; however,, many of the tests available take considerable administration time,, possibly bearing psychological strain on patients. The Short and Tailored Evaluation of Language Ability (STELA) is a simplified,, tablet-based language ability assessment system developed to address this issue,, with a reduced number of items and automated testing process.
36753308#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper is to assess the administration time,, internal consistency,, and validity of the STELA.
36753308#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The STELA consists of a tablet app,, a microphone,, and an input keypad for clinician's use. The system is designed to assess language ability with 52 questions grouped into 2 comprehension modalities (auditory comprehension and reading comprehension) and 3 expression modalities (naming and sentence formation,, repetition,, and reading aloud). Performance in each modality was scored as the correct answer rate (0-100),, and overall performance expressed as the sum of modality scores (out of 500 points).
36753308#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The time taken to complete the STELA was significantly less than the time for the WAB (mean 16.2,, SD 9.4 vs mean 149.3,, SD 64.1 minutes; P<.001). The STELA's total score was strongly correlated with the WAB Aphasia Quotient (r=0.93,, P<.001),, supporting the former's concurrent validity concerning the WAB,, which is a gold-standard aphasia assessment. Strong correlations were also observed at the subscale level; STELA auditory comprehension versus WAB auditory comprehension (r=0.75,, P<.001),, STELA repetition versus WAB repetition (r=0.96,, P<.001),, STELA naming and sentence formation versus WAB naming and word finding (r=0.81,, P<.001),, and the sum of STELA reading comprehension or reading aloud versus WAB reading (r=0.82,, P<.001). Cronbach a obtained for each modality was .862 for auditory comprehension,, .872 for reading comprehension,, .902 for naming and sentence formation,, .787 for repetition,, and .892 for reading aloud. Global Cronbach a was .961. The average of the values of item-total correlation to each subscale was 0.61 (SD 0.17).
36753308#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our study confirmed significant time reduction in the assessment of language ability and provided evidence for good internal consistency and validity of the STELA tablet-based aphasia assessment system.

37019043#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To design,, develop and pilot the 'Quest' app for smartphone-based relapse prevention for patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS).
37019043#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Principles of relapse prevention and motivation enhancement were used to develop the Quest App. Four addiction psychiatrists reviewed the app using the "app evaluation framework". Thirty patients (> 18 yrs age) diagnosed with ADS,, who had an Android smartphone,, were fluent in writing and reading English and agreed to use the app regularly for the next three months were enrolled in this study. After initial treatment for intoxication/withdrawal and with written consent,, patients in the study group (TAUQ) were requested to download the Quest application from a downloadable installation file. The usability and acceptability of Quest App amongst TAUQ patients was evaluated using the usability section of the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). The short-term effectiveness at the end of three months was compared between TAUQ and comparison group who received Treatment as Usual (TAU).
37019043#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both acceptability (65 %) and usability (5.8 out of 7) of the app were high. The patient groups (with or without Quest app) showed a significant reduction in drinking at 30,, 60,, and 90 days follow-up compared with their baseline number of drinking days. There was no significant difference between the two groups (with or without Quest App) in the median number of lapses and the median number of days of heavy drinking.
37019043#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This is the first attempt to develop a smartphone app and test its feasibility in preventing relapse among patients with ADS in the Indian population. Further validation of the app after incorporating feedback and testing on a larger sample size and multiple languages is required.

35021022#ABSTRACT##Effective delivery of post-insertion instructions is essential for denture care and oral health. This study aimed to develop a progressive web application (PWA) to educate patients' chairside and serve as a reference material. A need analysis was conducted before prototype development. Subsequently,, the prototype was subjected to content verification,, design appraisal and usability testing. The results of usability testing revealed a user task success rate of 94.4%,, with an adjusted Wald 95% confidence interval of 83-100%. User satisfaction assessed using the Single Ease Questionnaire and System Usability Score reported a mean score of 6.13 (95% CI: 5.69-6.55) and 85.9 (95% CI: 82.2-89.6),, respectively,, indicating good usability. This study highlights the systematic approach of developing an evidence-based educational PWA to meet the usability standards for mobile applications. This PWA is useful in clinical studies to explore mobile technologies' potential in educating denture wearers,, especially in the older population.

31647467#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Many recent commercial devices aim at providing a practical way to measure energy expenditure. However,, those devices are limited in accuracy.
31647467#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to build a model of energy consumption during walking applicable to a range of sloped surfaces,, used in conjunction with a simple,, wearable device.
31647467#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We constructed a model of energy consumption during gradient walking by using arguments based in mechanics. We built a foot monitoring system that used pressure sensors on the foot insoles. We did experiments in which participants walked on a treadmill wearing the foot monitoring system,, and indirect calorimetry was used for validation. We found the parameters of the model by fitting to the data.
31647467#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#When walking at 1.5 m/s,, we found that the model predicted a calorie consumption rate of 5.54 kcal/min for a woman with average height and weight and 6.89 kcal/min for an average man. With the obtained parameters,, the model predicted the data with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.96 kcal/min and median percent error of 12.4%.
31647467#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our model was found to be an accurate predictor of energy consumption when walking on a range of slopes. The model uses few variables; thus,, it can be used in conjunction with a convenient wearable device.

28243069#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Nowadays,, mobile technologies are part of everyday life,, but the lack of instruments to assess their acceptability for the management of chronic diseases makes their actual adoption for this purpose slow.
28243069#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to develop a survey instrument for assessing patients' attitude toward and intention to use mobile technology for diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management,, as well as to identify sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life factors that affect them.
28243069#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We first conducted the documentation and instrument design phases,, which were subsequently followed by the pilot study and instrument validation. Afterward,, the instrument was administered 103 patients (median age: 37 years; range: 18-65 years) diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 DM,, who accepted to participate in the study. The reliability and construct validity were assessed by computing Cronbach's alpha and using factor analysis,, respectively.
28243069#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The instrument included statements about the actual use of electronic devices for DM management,, interaction between patient and physician,, attitude toward using mobile technology,, and quality of life evaluation. Cronbach's alpha was 0.9 for attitude toward using mobile technology and 0.97 for attitude toward using mobile device applications for DM self-management. Younger patients (Spearman's ?=-0.429; P<0.001) with better glycemic control (Spearman's ?=-0.322; P<0.001) and higher education level (Kendall's t=0.51; P<0.001) had significantly more favorable attitude toward using mobile assistive applications for DM control. Moreover,, patients with a higher quality of life presented a significantly more positive attitude toward using modern technology (Spearman's ?=0.466; P<0.001).
28243069#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The instrument showed good reliability and internal consistency,, making it suitable for measuring the acceptability of mobile technology for DM self-management. Additionally,, we found that even if most of the patients showed positive attitude toward mobile applications,, only a moderate level of intention to indeed use them was observed. Moreover,, the study indicated that barriers were truthfulness and easiness to use.

25693595#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To describe the design and validation of text messages (short message service,, SMS) that will be used for an mHealth behavioral change intervention to prevent hypertension in three Latin American countries: Argentina,, Guatemala,, and Peru.
25693595#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An initial set of 64 SMS text messages were designed to promote healthy lifestyles among individuals in different stages of behavior change,, addressing four key domains: salt and sodium intake,, fruit and vegetable intake,, consumption of high fat and sugar foods,, and physical activity. The 64 SMS text messages were organized into nine subsets for field validation. In each country 36 people were recruited,, half of them being male. Of the participants,, 4 per country evaluated each subset of SMS text messages,, which contained between 6 and 8 SMS text messages regarding different key domains and stages of change. The understanding and appeal of each SMS text message was assessed using a 7-item questionnaire. The understanding and appeal ratings were used to reach a final set of 56 SMS text messages.
25693595#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, each of the 64 SMS text messages received a total of 12 evaluations (4 per country). The majority of evaluations-742 out of a total of 767 (96.7%) valid responses-revealed an adequate understanding of the key idea contained in the SMS text message. On a scale from 1 to 10,, the average appeal score was 8.7 points,, with a range of 4 to 10 points. Based on their low scores,, 8 SMS text messages per country were discarded. Once the final set of 56 SMS text messages was established,, and based on feedback obtained in the field,, wording and content of some SMS text messages were improved. Of the final set,, 9,, 8,, and 16 of the SMS text messages were improved based on participant evaluations from Argentina,, Guatemala,, and Peru,, respectively. Most SMS text messages selected for the final set (49/56,, 88%) were the same in all countries,, except for small wording differences.
25693595#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The final set of SMS text messages produced had very high rates of understanding and appeal in three different Latin American countries. This study highlights the importance of developing and validating a package of simple,, preventative SMS text messages,, grounded in evidence and theory,, across three different Latin American countries with active engagement of end users.

33949966#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To this end,, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ,, a digital platform through which data are gathered,, analyzed,, and displayed.
33949966#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This is a prospective,, nonrandomized,, open-label,, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI,, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study.
33949966#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of =0.75 (a=.05; power [1-ß]=0.80). Furthermore,, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants,, which would account for differences in the CDI performance,, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale.
33949966#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study,, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

30353814#ABSTRACT#STUDY OBJECTIVES#Mobile health (mHealth) tools such as smartphone applications (apps) have potential to support sleep self-management. The objective of this review was to identify the status of available consumer mHealth apps targeted toward supporting sleep self-management and assess their functionalities.
30353814#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched four mobile app stores (iTunes Appstore,, Android Google Play,, Amazon Appstore,, and Microsoft Appstore) using the terms "sleep",, "sleep management,," "sleep monitoring,," and "sleep tracking." Apps were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics functionality scores.
30353814#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified 2,,431 potentially relevant apps,, of which 73 met inclusion criteria. Most apps were excluded because they were unrelated to sleep self-management,, simply provided alarm service,, or solely played relaxation sounds in an attempt to improve sleep. The median overall MARS score was 3.1 out of 5,, and more than half of apps (42/73,, 58%) had a minimum acceptability score of 3.0. The apps had on average 7 functions based on the IMS functionality criteria (range 2 to 11). A record function was present in all apps but only eight had the function to intervene. About half of the apps (33/73,, 45%) collected data automatically using embedded sensors,, 27 apps allowed the user to manually enter sleep data,, and 14 apps supported both types of data recording.
30353814#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings suggest that few apps meet prespecified criteria for quality,, content,, and functionality for sleep self-management. Despite the rapid evolution of sleep self-management apps,, lack of validation studies is a significant concern that limits the clinical value of these apps.

32571722#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#In Ontario,, Canada,, parents have the responsibility to report their child's routine infant and childhood vaccines to the provincial immunization registry (the Digital Health Immunization Repository; DHIR) without healthcare provider validation. Despite its use in routine immunization coverage monitoring,, no study has previously examined the completeness of immunization data within the DHIR.
32571722#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We assessed the completeness of DHIR immunizations,, as compared to immunizations within the Electronic Medical Records-Primary Care (EMRPC) database,, also known as EMRALD,, a network of family physician electronic medical records (EMRs). We linked client records from the DHIR and EMRPC to a centralized population file. To create the study cohort,, we examined children born during 2005-2008 and further defined the cohort based on those rostered to an EMRPC physician,, visit criteria to ensure ongoing care by an EMRPC provider,, and school attendance in Ontario at age 7. We calculated up-to-date (UTD) immunization coverage at age 7 for individual vaccines and overall using data from the DHIR and EMRPC separately,, and compared the estimates.
32571722#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The analytic cohort to assess DHIR data completeness included 2,,657 children. Overall UTD coverage (all vaccines assessed) was 82.0% in the DHIR and 67.6% in EMRPC. UTD coverage was higher in the DHIR for all vaccines assessed individually,, with the exception of meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (difference = 0.3%). After excluding two EMRPC sites with irregularities in immunization data,, the difference in overall UTD coverage between systems decreased from 14.4% to 6.6% INTERPRETATION: These results validate the use of DHIR for coverage assessment but also suggest that bidirectional exchange of immunization information has the potential to increase immunization data completeness in both systems.

34982720#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The postoperative period is crucial for the initiation of healing and prevention of complications after any surgical procedure. Due to factors such as poor compliance,, comprehension,, and retention of instructions,, and other unaccounted factors,, the objectives of postoperative care are not always achieved. Therefore,, an Android-based mobile health app (ExoDont) was developed to ensure a smooth postoperative period for patients after a dental extraction. The ExoDont app delivers reminders for postoperative instructions and drug intake at defined intervals,, thus fostering self-reliance among patients in taking their prescribed dose of medication.
34982720#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to design,, develop,, and validate ExoDont,, an innovative app for improved adherence to postoperative instructions after tooth extraction.
34982720#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A postoperative treatment protocol was developed by a team of oral and maxillofacial surgeons and general dentists,, following which the clinical and technological requirements of the app were determined along with the software engineers,, graphic designers,, and applications architect in the team. ExoDont was developed to provide timely reminders for medication and postoperative care. The app was field tested and validated using the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale.
34982720#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The ExoDont software design was divided into a 3-level architecture comprising a user interface application,, logical layer,, and database layer. The software architecture consists of an Android-based ExoDont app for patients and a web version of the admin panel. The testing and validation of the ExoDont app revealed that Perceived Impact received the highest mean score of all rated components (mean 4.6,, SD 0.5),, while Engagement received the lowest mean score (mean 3.5,, SD 0.8).
34982720#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The testing and validation of the app support its usability and functionality,, as well as its impact on users. The ExoDont app has been designed,, keeping the welfare of patients in view,, in a user-friendly manner that will help patients adhere to the prescribed drug regimen and ensure easy and efficient dissemination of postoperative instructions. It could play an instrumental role in fostering compliance among patients and significantly decrease the complication rate following dental extractions.

32587551#ABSTRACT##Over 250 million children in developing countries are at risk of not achieving their developmental potential,, and unlikely to receive timely interventions because existing developmental assessments that help identify children who are faltering are prohibitive for use in low resource contexts. To bridge this "detection gap,," we developed a tablet-based,, gamified cognitive assessment tool named DEvelopmental assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP),, which is feasible for delivery by non-specialists in rural Indian households and acceptable to all end-users. Here we provide proof-of-concept of using a supervised machine learning (ML) approach benchmarked to the Bayley's Scale of Infant and Toddler Development,, 3rd Edition (BSID-III) cognitive scale,, to predict a child's cognitive development using metrics derived from gameplay on DEEP. Two-hundred children aged 34-40 months recruited from rural Haryana,, India were concurrently assessed using DEEP and BSID-III. Seventy percent of the sample was used for training the ML algorithms using a 10-fold cross validation approach and ensemble modeling,, while 30% was assigned to the "test" dataset to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy on novel data. Of the 522 features that computationally described children's performance on DEEP,, 31 features which together represented all nine games of DEEP were selected in the final model. The predicted DEEP scores were in good agreement (ICC [2,,1] > 0.6) and positively correlated (Pearson's r = 0.67) with BSID-cognitive scores,, and model performance metrics were highly comparable between the training and test datasets. Importantly,, the mean absolute prediction error was less than three points (<10% error) on a possible range of 31 points on the BSID-cognitive scale in both the training and test datasets. Leveraging the power of ML which allows iterative improvements as more diverse data become available for training,, DEEP,, pending further validation,, holds promise to serve as an acceptable and feasible cognitive assessment tool to bridge the detection gap and support optimum child development.

36006685#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are major global public health concerns. Over 1 million curable STIs occur every day among people aged 15 years to 49 years worldwide. Insufficient testing or screening substantially impedes the elimination of HIV and STI transmission.
36006685#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of our study was to develop an HIV and STI risk prediction tool using machine learning algorithms.
36006685#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used clinic consultations that tested for HIV and STIs at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between March 2,, 2015,, and December 31,, 2018,, as the development data set (training and testing data set). We also used 2 external validation data sets,, including data from 2019 as external "validation data 1" and data from January 2020 and January 2021 as external "validation data 2." We developed 34 machine learning models to assess the risk of acquiring HIV,, syphilis,, gonorrhea,, and chlamydia. We created an online tool to generate an individual's risk of HIV or an STI.
36006685#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The important predictors for HIV and STI risk were gender,, age,, men who reported having sex with men,, number of casual sexual partners,, and condom use. Our machine learning-based risk prediction tool,, named MySTIRisk,, performed at an acceptable or excellent level on testing data sets (area under the curve [AUC] for HIV=0.78; AUC for syphilis=0.84; AUC for gonorrhea=0.78; AUC for chlamydia=0.70) and had stable performance on both external validation data from 2019 (AUC for HIV=0.79; AUC for syphilis=0.85; AUC for gonorrhea=0.81; AUC for chlamydia=0.69) and data from 2020-2021 (AUC for HIV=0.71; AUC for syphilis=0.84; AUC for gonorrhea=0.79; AUC for chlamydia=0.69).
36006685#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our web-based risk prediction tool could accurately predict the risk of HIV and STIs for clinic attendees using simple self-reported questions. MySTIRisk could serve as an HIV and STI screening tool on clinic websites or digital health platforms to encourage individuals at risk of HIV or an STI to be tested or start HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. The public can use this tool to assess their risk and then decide if they would attend a clinic for testing. Clinicians or public health workers can use this tool to identify high-risk individuals for further interventions.

34757321#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The use of FeverTracker for malaria surveillance is evident,, given the archaic paper-based surveillance tools used currently. The use of the app in 19 tribal villages of the Dhalai district in Tripura,, India,, assisted in the surveillance of 1880 suspected malaria patients and confirmed malaria infection in 93.4% (114/122; Plasmodium falciparum),, 4.9% (6/122; P vivax),, and 1.6% (2/122; P falciparum/P vivax mixed infection) of cases. Digital tools such as FeverTracker will be critical in integrating disease surveillance,, and they offer instant data digitization for downstream processing.
34757321#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The use of this technology in health care and research will strengthen the ongoing efforts to eliminate malaria. Moreover,, FeverTracker provides a modifiable template for deployment in other disease systems.
35415400#ABSTRACT##Consumer sleep tracking technologies offer an unobtrusive and cost-efficient way to monitor sleep in free-living conditions. Technological advances in hardware and software have significantly improved the functionality of the new gadgets that recently appeared in the market. However,, whether the latest gadgets can provide valid measurements on overall sleep parameters and sleep structure such as deep and REM sleep has not been examined. In this study,, we aimed to investigate the validity of the latest consumer sleep tracking devices including an activity wristband Fitbit Charge 2 and a wearable EEG-based eye mask Neuroon in comparison to a medical sleep monitor. First,, we confirmed that Fitbit Charge 2 can automatically detect the onset and offset of sleep with reasonable accuracy. Second,, analysis found that both consumer devices produced comparable results in measuring total sleep duration and sleep efficiency compared to the medical device. In addition,, Fitbit accurately measured the number of awakenings,, while Neuroon with good signal quality had satisfactory performance on total awake time and sleep onset latency. However,, measuring sleep structure including light,, deep,, and REM sleep remains to be challenging for both consumer devices. Third,, greater discrepancies were observed between Neuroon and the medical device in nights with more disrupted sleep and when the signal quality was poor,, but no trend was observed in Fitbit Charge 2. This study suggests that current consumer sleep tracking technologies may be immature for diagnosing sleep disorders,, but they are reasonably satisfactory for general purpose and non-clinical use.

32764197#ABSTRACT##for the younger healthy controls. Using just two simple features,, the PTT and patient height,, we demonstrate a machine learning prediction model for CAD with a median accuracy of 0.83 (AUC).Significance. This work demonstrates the ability to predict atherosclerosis and CAD using a single simple physiological measurement with a multi-site PPG tool that is electrically powered by a mobile phone and does not require any electrocardiogram reference. Furthermore,, this method only requires a single anthropometric measurement,, which is the patient's height.

37074760#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#eHealth resources and interventions promise to promote favorable behavior change,, self-efficacy,, and knowledge acquisition,, thereby improving health literacy. However,, individuals with limited eHealth literacy may find it difficult to identify,, understand,, and benefit from eHealth use. It is necessary to identify the self-assessed eHealth literacy of those who use eHealth resources to classify their eHealth literacy levels and to determine the demographic characteristics associated with higher and lower eHealth literacy skills.
37074760#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to identify notable factors closely associated with limited eHealth literacy among Chinese male populations to provide some implications for clinical practice,, health education,, medical research,, and public health policy making.
37074760#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#All data from the 543 returned questionnaires were valid according to the validation criteria. By interpreting these descriptive statistics,, we found that 4 factors were significantly correlated with participants' limited eHealth literacy: older age,, lower education attainment,, lower levels of all aspects of health literacy (functional,, communicative,, and critical),, and weaker beliefs and self-confidence in internal drivers and strengths to stay healthy.

37074760#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We hypothesized that participants' eHealth literacy status was associated with various demographic characteristics. Therefore,, we elicited the following information in the questionnaire: age and education,, self-assessed disease knowledge,, 3 well-developed health literacy assessment tools (ie,, the All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale,, eHealth Literacy Scale,, and General Health Numeracy Test),, and the 6 Internal items on health beliefs and self-confidence in the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scales. Using randomized sampling,, we recruited survey participants from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University,, China. After validating the data collected through a web-based questionnaire survey via wenjuanxing,, we coded all valid data according to predefined coding schemes of Likert scales with different point (score) ranges. We then calculated the total scores of the subsections of the scales or the entire scale. Finally,, we used logistic regression modeling to associate the scores of the eHealth Literacy Scale with the scores of the All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale,, the General Health Numeracy Test-6,, and age and education to ascertain factors considerably associated with limited eHealth literacy among Chinese male populations.
37074760#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#By applying logistic regression modeling,, we ascertained 4 factors that were significantly correlated with limited eHealth literacy among Chinese male populations. These relevant factors identified can inform stakeholders engaging in clinical practice,, health education,, medical research,, and health policy making.
36534456#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Elevated psychological distress has demonstrated impacts on individuals' health. Reliable and efficient ways to detect distress are key to early intervention. Artificial intelligence has the potential to detect states of emotional distress in an accurate,, efficient,, and timely manner.
36534456#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to automatically classify short segments of speech obtained from callers to national suicide prevention helpline services according to high versus low psychological distress and using a range of vocal characteristics in combination with machine learning approaches.
27649587#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As interest increases in the development of eHealth human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-preventive interventions for gay male couples,, Web-based methods must also be developed to help increase the likelihood that couples enrolled and data collected from them represent true unique dyads. Methods to recruit and collect reliable and valid data from both members of a couple are lacking,, yet are crucial for uptake of novel sexual health and HIV-prevention eHealth interventions. Methods to describe best practices to recruit male couples using targeted advertisements on Facebook are also lacking in the literature,, yet could also help in this uptake.
27649587#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of our study was to describe challenges and lessons learned from experiences from two phases (developmental phase and online randomized controlled trial [RCT]) of an eHealth HIV-prevention intervention for concordant HIV-negative male couples in terms of (1) recruiting male couples using targeted advertisements on Facebook,, (2) validating that data came from two partners of the couple,, and (3) verifying that the two partners of the couple are in a relationship with each other.

36534456#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 120 telephone call recordings were initially converted to 16-bit pulse code modulation format. Short variable-length segments of each call were rated on psychological distress using the distress thermometer by the responding counselor and a second team of psychologists (n=6) blinded to the initial ratings. Following this,, 24 vocal characteristics were initially extracted from 40-ms speech frames nested within segments within calls. After highly correlated variables were eliminated,, 19 remained. Of 19 vocal characteristics,, 7 were identified and validated as predictors of psychological distress using a penalized generalized additive mixed effects regression model,, accounting for nonlinearity,, autocorrelation,, and moderation by sex. Speech frames were then grouped using k-means clustering based on the selected vocal characteristics. Finally,, component-wise gradient boosting incorporating these clusters was used to classify each speech frame according to high versus low psychological distress. Classification accuracy was confirmed via leave-one-caller-out cross-validation,, ensuring that speech segments from individual callers were not used in both the training and test data.
36534456#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The sample comprised 87 female and 33 male callers. From an initial pool of 19 characteristics,, 7 vocal characteristics were identified. After grouping speech frames into 2 separate clusters (correlation with sex of caller,, Cramer's V =0.02),, the component-wise gradient boosting algorithm successfully classified psychological distress to a high level of accuracy,, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 97.39% (95% CI 96.20-98.45) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 97.52 (95% CI 95.71-99.12). Thus,, 39,,282 of 41,,883 (93.39%) speech frames nested within 728 of 754 segments (96.6%) were classified as exhibiting low psychological distress,, and 71455 of 75503 (94.64%) speech frames nested within 382 of 423 (90.3%) segments were classified as exhibiting high psychological distress. As the probability of high psychological distress increases,, male callers spoke louder,, with greater vowel articulation but with greater roughness (subharmonic depth). In contrast,, female callers exhibited decreased vocal clarity (entropy),, greater proportion of signal noise,, higher frequencies,, increased breathiness (spectral slope),, and increased roughness of speech with increasing psychological distress. Individual caller random effects contributed 68% to risk reduction in the classification algorithm,, followed by cluster configuration (23.4%),, spectral slope (4.4%),, and the 50th percentile frequency (4.2%).
36534456#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The high level of accuracy achieved suggests possibilities for real-time detection of psychological distress in helpline settings and has potential uses in pre-emptive triage and evaluations of counseling outcomes.

27649587#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The developmental phase refined the intervention via in-person focus groups,, whereas the pilot-testing phase included an online RCT. For both phases,, couples were recruited via targeted Facebook advertisements. Advertisements directed men to a study webpage and screener; once eligible,, participants provided consent electronically. A partner referral system was embedded in the consenting process to recruit the relationship partner of the participant. Both men of the couple had to meet all eligibility criteria-individually and as a couple-before they could enroll in the study. Verification of couples' relationships was assessed via the concurrence of predetermined screener items from both partners,, done manually in the developmental phase and electronically in the pilot-testing phase. A system of decision rules was developed to assess the validity that data came from two unique partners of a couple.
27649587#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Several important lessons were learned from these experiences,, resulting in recommendations for future eHealth studies involving male couples. Use of certain "interests" and types of images (eg,, shirtless) in targeted Facebook advertisements should be avoided or used sparingly because these interests and types of images may generate adverse reactions from a broader audience. Development of a systematic approach with predetermined criteria and parameters to verify male couples' relationships is strongly recommended. Further,, researchers are encouraged to develop a system of decision rules to detect and handle suspicious data (eg,, suspicious email addresses/names,, multiple entries,, same IP address used in multiple entries) to help validate the legitimacy of male couples' relationships online.
27649587#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These lessons learned combined with recommendations for future studies aim to help enhance recruitment efforts and the validity and reliability of collecting dyadic data from male couples for novel eHealth HIV-preventive interventions.

34429221#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#In mild asthma,, as-needed budesonide-formoterol offers similar protection from severe exacerbations as daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS),, with lower ICS exposure but slightly increased symptoms. We sought to develop an electronic decision aid to guide discussions about the pros and cons of these first-line options,, while identifying and integrating user preferences.
34429221#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Following International Patient Decision Aid Standards,, we created a mild asthma decision aid prototype comparing convenience,, clinical outcomes,, cumulative ICS dose exposure,, costs,, and side-effects of each option. After face validation,, the prototype was iteratively adapted through rapid-cycle development. Each cycle consisted of a patient focus group and a primary care physician interview. We made user preference-based improvements after each round,, until reaching a pre-set stopping criterion (no new critical issues identified). We then performed a summative qualitative content analysis.
34429221#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Over 5 cycles,, we recruited 21 asthma patients (12/21 women,, 10/21 = 60 years old) and 5 physicians. Serial changes included simplification and reduction of text and reading level,, inclusion of an ICS "myths" section and elaboration of patient-friendly infographics for numerical comparisons. User preferences fell within Content,, Format,, and tool use Process themes. In response to decision-making preferences,, we created a complementary one-page conversation aid for patient-provider use at the point-of-care.
34429221#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We present preference-based electronic patient decision and conversation aids for treatment of mild asthma. Our user preference analyses offer useful insights for development of such tools in other chronic diseases. These tools now require integration into point-of-care workflows for measurement of real-world uptake and impact.

31868970#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Large birth cohort studies are extremely valuable in assessing associations between early life exposures and long-term outcomes. Establishing new birth cohorts is challenging due to declining participation rates. Online methods of data collection may increase feasibility,, but have not been evaluated thoroughly.
31868970#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The primary objective of the ongoing PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study is to identify exposures during pregnancy and in early life that may affect short-term or long-term health of mother and/or child. In this manuscript,, we aimed to evaluate methods of recruitment and online data collection applied.
31868970#ABSTRACT#POPULATION#Dutch women aged =18 years in early pregnancy.
31868970#ABSTRACT#DESIGN#Prospective cohort study.
31868970#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Initially,, only prenatal care providers recruited participants,, but alternative recruitment methods were added as a result of disappointing participation rates,, including collaboration with "Moeders voor Moeders" (organisation that visits women in early pregnancy) and Facebook advertisements. Data on demographic characteristics,, obstetric history,, maternal health,, life style factors,, occupational exposures,, nutrition,, pregnancy complications,, and infant outcomes are primarily collected through Web-based questionnaires at multiple time points during and after pregnancy. Additional data collection components include paternal questionnaires,, blood and saliva sampling,, and linkage to medical records.
31868970#ABSTRACT#PRELIMINARY RESULTS#By September 2019,, 9573 women were included in the PRIDE Study,, of which 1.3% completed paper-based questionnaires. Mean age of the women analysed was 30.6 years,, 71.1% had a high level of education,, 57.2% were primiparae,, and mean gestational age at enrolment was 9.9 (range 3,, 37) weeks,, with slight differences between recruitment methods. Pregnancy outcome was known for 89.8%. Retention rate at 6 months after the estimated date of delivery was estimated at 70%. Multiple validation studies conducted within the PRIDE Study indicated high data quality.
31868970#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION(S)#Although challenging and time-consuming,, online methods for recruitment and data collection may enable the establishment of new birth cohort studies.

33329060#ABSTRACT##The mDurance® system is an innovative digital tool that combines wearable surface electromyography (sEMG),, mobile computing and cloud analysis to streamline and automatize the assessment of muscle activity. The tool is particularly devised to support clinicians and sport professionals in their daily routines,, as an assessment tool in the prevention,, monitoring rehabilitation and training field. This study aimed at determining the validity of the mDurance system for measuring muscle activity by comparing sEMG output with a reference sEMG system,, the Delsys® system. Fifteen participants were tested during isokinetic knee extensions at three different speeds (60,, 180,, and 300 deg/s),, for two muscles (rectus femoris [RF] and vastus lateralis [VL]) and two different electrodes locations (proximal and distal placement). The maximum voluntary isometric contraction was carried out for the normalization of the signal,, followed by dynamic isokinetic knee extensions for each speed. The sEMG output for both systems was obtained from the raw sEMG signal following mDurance's processing and filtering. Mean,, median,, first quartile,, third quartile and 90th percentile was calculated from the sEMG amplitude signals for each system. The results show an almost perfect ICC relationship for the VL (ICC > 0.81) and substantial to almost perfect for the RF (ICC > 0.762) for all variables and speeds. The Bland-Altman plots revealed heteroscedasticity of error for mean,, quartile 3 and 90th percentile (60 and 300 deg/s) for RF and at mean and 90th percentile for VL (300 deg/s). In conclusion,, the results indicate that the mDurance® sEMG system is a valid tool to measure muscle activity during dynamic contractions over a range of speeds. This innovative system provides more time for clinicians (e.g.,, interpretation patients' pathologies) and sport trainers (e.g.,, advising athletes),, thanks to automatic processing and filtering of the raw sEMG signal and generation of muscle activity reports in real-time.
37406806#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed. The Markov model structure was determined by biological and clinical understanding of asthma and was further informed by guideline-based assessment of model development. Internal and external validation was performed using the AdViSHE tool. The INCA Sun randomized clinical trial data were incorporated into the model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of digital inhalers. Several long-term clinical case scenarios were assessed (reduced number of exacerbations,, increased asthma control,, introduction of biosimilars [25% price-cut on biologics]).
37406806#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The long-term modelled cost-effectiveness based on a societal perspective indicated 1-year per-patient costs for digital inhalers and usual care (i.e.,, regular inhalers) of €7,,546 and €10,,752,, respectively,, reflecting cost savings of €3,,207 for digital inhalers. Using a 10-year intervention duration and time horizon resulted incost savings of €26,,309 for digital inhalers. In the first year,, add-on biologic therapies accounted for 69% of the total costs in the usual care group,, and for 49% in the digital inhaler group. Scenario analyses indicated consistent cost savings ranging from €2,,287 (introduction biosimilars) to €4,,581 (increased control,, decreased exacerbations).

32706689#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The use of apps for weight management has increased over recent years; however,, there is a lack of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of these apps. The EVALAPPS project will develop and validate an assessment instrument to specifically assess the safety and efficacy of weight management apps.
32706689#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among stakeholders on a comprehensive set of criteria to guide development of the EVALAPPS assessment instrument. A modified Delphi process was used in order to verify the robustness of the criteria that had been identified through a literature review and to prioritize a set of the identified criteria.
32706689#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Stakeholders (n=31) were invited to participate in a 2-round Delphi process with 114 initial criteria that had been identified from the literature. In round 1,, participants rated criteria according to relevance on a scale from 0 ("I suggest this criterion is excluded") to 5 ("This criterion is extremely relevant"). A criterion was accepted if the median rating was 4 or higher and if the relative intraquartile range was equal to 0.67 or lower. In round 2,, participants were asked about criteria that had been discarded in round 1. A prioritization strategy was used to identify crucial criteria according to (1) the importance attributed by participants (criteria with a mean rating of 4.00 or higher),, (2) the level of consensus (criteria with a score of 4 or 5 by at least 80% of the participants).
32706689#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The response rate was 83.9% (26/31) in round 1 and 90.3% (28/31) in round 2. A total of 107 out of 114 criteria (93.9%) were accepted by consensus-105 criteria in round 1 and 2 criteria in round 2. After prioritization,, 53 criteria were deemed crucial. These related mainly to the dimensions of security and privacy (13/53,, 24.5%) and usability (9/53,, 17.0%),, followed by activity data (5/53,, 9.4%),, clinical effectiveness (5/53,, 9.4%),, and reliability (5/53,, 9.4%).
32706689#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Results confirmed the robustness of the criteria that were identified,, with those relating to security and privacy being deemed most relevant by stakeholders. Additionally,, a specific set of criteria based on health indicators (activity data,, physical state data,, and personal data) was also prioritized.

35449626#ABSTRACT##Introduction Mobile health has the potential to improve self-care for people with chronic conditions. There are few previously published studies that have examined asthma patients' use of cell phone features and their willingness to use them for self-care in Saudi Arabia. Moreover,, there is no validated instrument in Arabic to test the use of cell phone functions. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the general use of cell phone features by asthma patients and their willingness to use them and to determine the frequency of use of cell phone features by asthma patients. It also aimed to translate and validate an Arabic version of the questionnaire to test the use of cell phone functions by asthma patients. Methods This study was conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2021 using an online questionnaire. The test was translated (changes were made as needed) and validated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. After validation of the instrument,, the questionnaire included 34 questions divided into three sections: demographic information,, current use of cell phone features,, and desire to use cell phone features. Adults with asthma aged 18 years and older who owned a smartphone participated in the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Two hundred and seventy asthma patients completed the questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire was 0.86,, indicating its reliability and consistency. Only 39 (14.4%) of the participants use cell phones for asthma care,, and 13 (4.8%) have apps for asthma care on their cell phones. However,, 74.1% of participants have a desire to use a cell phone for asthma care. The majority of participating asthma patients (67.8%) occasionally used the mobile internet browser to search for asthma information. Surprisingly,, most of the participating asthma patients did not show a greater desire to use methods other than the internet browser to obtain asthma information. They did,, however,, have a strong desire to use the news to obtain information about asthma. Conclusion Because the study shows that asthma patients prefer internet searches followed by the news to obtain information,, stakeholders need to pay more attention to the quality,, quantity,, completeness,, and accuracy of health information in these media.

35493532#ABSTRACT##The prevention and treatment of mental illness is a serious social issue. Prediction and intervention,, however,, have been difficult because of lack of objective biomarkers for mental illness. The objective of this study was to use biometric data acquired from wearable devices as well as medical examination data to build a predictive model that can contribute to the prevention of the onset of mental illness. This was an observational study of 4,,612 subjects from the health database of society-managed health insurance in Japan provided by JMDC Inc. The inputs to the predictive model were 3-months of continuous wearable data and medical examinations within and near that period; the output was the presence or absence of mental illness over the following month,, as defined by insurance claims data. The features relating to the wearable data were sleep,, activity,, and resting heart rate,, measured by a consumer-grade wearable device (specifically,, Fitbit). The predictive model was built using the XGBoost algorithm and presented an area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.712 (SD = 0.02,, a repeated stratified group 10-fold cross validation). The top-ranking feature importance measure was wearable data,, and its importance was higher than the blood-test values from medical examinations. Detailed verification of the model showed that predictions were made based on disrupted sleep rhythms,, mild physical activity duration,, alcohol use,, and medical examination data on disrupted eating habits as risk factors. In summary,, the predictive model showed useful accuracy for grouping the risk of mental illness onset,, suggesting the potential of predictive detection,, and preventive intervention using wearable devices. Sleep abnormalities in particular were detected as wearable data 3 months prior to mental illness onset,, and the possibility of early intervention targeting the stabilization of sleep as an effective measure for mental illness onset was shown.

36900872#ABSTRACT##This article reports the study protocol of a nationwide multicentric study in seven Italian regions aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a digitally supported approach for the early screening of frailty risk factors in community-dwelling older adults. SUNFRAIL+ is a prospective observational cohort study aimed at carrying out a multidimensional assessment of community-dwelling older adults through an IT platform,, which allows to connect the items of the SUNFRAIL frailty assessment tool with a cascading multidimensional in-depth assessment of the bio-psycho-social domains of frailty. Seven centers in seven Italian regions will administer the SUNFRAIL questionnaire to 100 older adults. According to the answers provided by older adults,, they will be subjected to one or more validated in-depth scale tests in order to perform further diagnostic or dimensional evaluations. The study aims to contribute to the implementation and validation of a multiprofessional and multistakeholder service model for the screening of frailty in community-dwelling older adult population.

34876396#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration.
34876396#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort,, ease of application,, sustainability of positioning,, and aesthetics.
34876396#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We found that the Cloud DX's Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts,, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality.

34876396#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Included participants were =18 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable,, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions,, 3 cNIBP measurements,, each 30 seconds,, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session,, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software,, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability.
34876396#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds),, respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were -0.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position,, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie,, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time).

36990592#ABSTRACT##The increasing reliance on mobile health for managing disease conditions has opened a new frontier in digital health,, thus,, the need for understanding what constitutes positive and negative sentiments of the various apps. This paper relies on Embedded Deep Neural Networks (E-DNN),, Kmeans,, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for predicting the sentiments of diabetes mobile apps users and identifying the themes and sub-themes of positive and negative sentimental users. A total of 38,,640 comments from 39 diabetes mobile apps obtained from the google play store are analyzed and accuracy of 87.67 % ± 2.57 % was obtained from a 10-fold leave-one-out cross-validation. This accuracy is 2.95 % - 18.71 % better than other predominant algorithms used for sentiment analysis and 3.47 % - 20.17 % better than the results obtained by previous researchers. The study also identified the challenges of diabetes mobile apps usage to include safety and security issues,, outdated information for diabetes management,, clumsy user interface,, and difficulty controlling operations. The positives of the apps are ease of operation,, lifestyle management,, effectiveness in communication and control,, and data management capabilities.

36109638#ABSTRACT##The storage of facial images in medical records poses privacy risks due to the sensitive nature of the personal biometric information that can be extracted from such images. To minimize these risks,, we developed a new technology,, called the digital mask (DM),, which is based on three-dimensional reconstruction and deep-learning algorithms to irreversibly erase identifiable features,, while retaining disease-relevant features needed for diagnosis. In a prospective clinical study to evaluate the technology for diagnosis of ocular conditions,, we found very high diagnostic consistency between the use of original and reconstructed facial videos (??=?0.845 for strabismus,, ptosis and nystagmus,, and ??=?0.801 for thyroid-associated orbitopathy) and comparable diagnostic accuracy (P?=?0.131 for all ocular conditions tested) was observed. Identity removal validation using multiple-choice questions showed that compared to image cropping,, the DM could much more effectively remove identity attributes from facial images. We further confirmed the ability of the DM to evade recognition systems using artificial intelligence-powered re-identification algorithms. Moreover,, use of the DM increased the willingness of patients with ocular conditions to provide their facial images as health information during medical treatment. These results indicate the potential of the DM algorithm to protect the privacy of patients' facial images in an era of rapid adoption of digital health technologies.

36086268#ABSTRACT##Digital health applications are becoming increasingly important for assessing and monitoring the wellbeing of people suffering from mental health conditions like depression. A common target of said applications is to predict the results of self-assessed Patient-Health-Questionnaires (PHQ),, indicating current symptom severity of depressive individuals. Many of the currently available approaches to predict PHQ scores use passive data,, e.g.,, from smartphones. However,, there are several other scores and data besides PHQ,, e.g.,, the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form (BADSSF),, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD),, or the Personality Dynamics Diary (PDD),, all of which can be effortlessly collected on a daily basis. In this work,, we explore the potential of using actively-collected data to predict and forecast daily PHQ-2 scores on a newly-collected longitudinal dataset. We obtain a best MAE of 1.417 for daily prediction of PHQ-2 scores,, which specifically in the used dataset have a range of 0 to 12,, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation,, as well as a best MAE of 1.914 for forecasting PHQ-2 scores using data from up to the last 7 days. This illustrates the additive value that can be obtained by incorporating actively-collected data in a depression monitoring application.

35732153#ABSTRACT##Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is emerging as global problem with unknown molecular drivers. Using a digital epidemiology approach,, we recruited 8,,077 individuals to the cohort study for digital health research in Germany (DigiHero) to respond to a basic questionnaire followed by a PASC-focused survey and blood sampling. We report the first 318 participants,, the majority thereof after mild infections. Of those,, 67.8% report PASC,, predominantly consisting of fatigue,, dyspnea,, and concentration deficit,, which persists in 60% over the mean 8-month follow-up period and resolves independently of post-infection vaccination. PASC is not associated with autoantibodies,, but with elevated IL-1ß,, IL-6,, and TNF plasma levels,, which we confirm in a validation cohort with 333 additional participants and a longer time from infection of 10 months. Blood profiling and single-cell data from early infection suggest the induction of these cytokines in COVID-19 lung pro-inflammatory macrophages creating a self-sustaining feedback loop.

32558656#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The provision of eye care services is currently insufficient to meet the requirements of eye care. Many people remain unnecessarily visually impaired or at risk of becoming so because of treatable or preventable eye conditions. A lack of access and awareness of services is,, in large part,, a key barrier to handle this unmet need.
32558656#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to assess whether utilizing novel smartphone-based clinical algorithms can task-shift eye screening to community volunteers (CVs) to accurately identify and refer patients to primary eye care services. In particular,, we developed the Peek Community Screening app and assessed its validity in making referral decisions for patients with eye problems.
32558656#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed a smartphone-based clinical algorithm (the Peek Community Screening app) using age,, distance vision,, near vision,, and pain as referral criteria. We then compared CVs' referral decisions using this app with those made by an experienced ophthalmic clinical officer (OCO),, which was the reference standard. The same participants were assessed by a trained CV using the app and by an OCO using standard outreach equipment. The outcome was the proportion of all decisions that were correct when compared with that of the OCO.
32558656#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The required sensitivity and specificity for the Peek Community Screening app were achieved after seven iterations. In the seventh iteration,, the OCO identified referable eye problems in 65.9% (378/574) of the participants. CVs correctly identified 344 of 378 (sensitivity 91.0%; 95% CI 87.7%-93.7%) of the cases and correctly identified 153 of 196 (specificity 78.1%; 95% CI 71.6%-83.6%) cases as not having a referable eye problem. The positive predictive value was 88.9% (95% CI 85.3%-91.8%),, and the negative predictive value was 81.8% (95% CI 75.5%-87.1%).
32558656#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Development of such an algorithm is feasible; however,, it requires considerable effort and resources. CVs can accurately use the Peek Community Screening app to identify and refer people with eye problems. An iterative design process is necessary to ensure validity in the local context.

35890783#ABSTRACT##Artificial intelligence is serving as an impetus in digital health,, clinical support,, and health informatics for an informed patient's outcome. Previous studies only consider classification accuracies of cardiotocographic (CTG) datasets and disregard computational time,, which is a relevant parameter in a clinical environment. This paper proposes a modified deep neural algorithm to classify untapped pathological and suspicious CTG recordings with the desired time complexity. In our newly developed classification algorithm,, AlexNet architecture is merged with support vector machines (SVMs) at the fully connected layers to reduce time complexity. We used an open-source UCI (Machine Learning Repository) dataset of cardiotocographic (CTG) recordings. We divided 2126 CTG recordings into 3 classes (Normal,, Pathological,, and Suspected),, including 23 attributes that were dynamically programmed and fed to our algorithm. We employed a deep transfer learning (TL) mechanism to transfer prelearned features to our model. To reduce time complexity,, we implemented a strategy wherein layers in the convolutional base were partially trained to leave others in the frozen states. We used an ADAM optimizer for the optimization of hyperparameters. The presented algorithm also outperforms the leading architectures (RCNNs,, ResNet,, DenseNet,, and GoogleNet) with respect to real-time accuracies,, sensitivities,, and specificities of 99.72%,, 96.67%,, and 99.6%,, respectively,, making it a viable candidate for clinical settings after real-time validation.

30789439#ABSTRACT##: The accurate assessment of sleep is critical to better understand and evaluate its role in health and disease. The boom in wearable technology is part of the digital health revolution and is producing many novel,, highly sophisticated and relatively inexpensive consumer devices collecting data from multiple sensors and claiming to extract information about users' behaviors,, including sleep. These devices are now able to capture different biosignals for determining,, for example,, HR and its variability,, skin conductance,, and temperature,, in addition to activity. They perform 24/7,, generating overwhelmingly large data sets (big data),, with the potential of offering an unprecedented window on users' health. Unfortunately,, little guidance exists within and outside the scientific sleep community for their use,, leading to confusion and controversy about their validity and application. The current state-of-the-art review aims to highlight use,, validation and utility of consumer wearable sleep-trackers in clinical practice and research. Guidelines for a standardized assessment of device performance is deemed necessary,, and several critical factors (proprietary algorithms,, device malfunction,, firmware updates) need to be considered before using these devices in clinical and sleep research protocols. Ultimately,, wearable sleep technology holds promise for advancing understanding of sleep health; however,, a careful path forward needs to be navigated,, understanding the benefits and pitfalls of this technology as applied in sleep research and clinical sleep medicine.

29066421#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Caregiver input has informed the design of a valid electronic patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure for use in pediatric rehabilitation. This proxy assessment may be further developed to expedite and enhance patient-centered care planning processes,, but user input is first needed to finalize the core requirements that will guide its design.
29066421#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of a stepwise process for building on a baseline assessment of young children's participation in activities to develop a care plan relevant to pediatric rehabilitation.
29066421#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional descriptive study design was employed using qualitative methods. Data were collected via Web-based technology and by telephone. Twenty-five caregivers of young children (9 with developmental delays,, 16 without delays) and between 1 and 7 years were recruited from a subsample of parents who had previously enrolled in a Web-based validation of a PRO on children's participation and provided consent for future contact. Each caregiver completed a demographic questionnaire and Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM) online,, followed by a 20- to 60-min semistructured and audiotaped phone interview to review and build upon PRO results as summarized in an electronic report. Interview data were content coded to the interview guide and reviewed by multiple research staff to estimate feasibility according to stepwise completion rates,, perceptions of difficulty in step completion,, and perceptions of overall utility.
29066421#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Half of the participants in the final study sample (N=25) fully completed a stepwise process of building on their baseline PRO assessment to develop an initial care plan for their child. In most cases,, similar stepwise completion rates and trends in the approaches taken for step completion were found regardless of the child's disability status. However,, more parents of children with disabilities reported difficulties in rank ordering their priorities for change and identified child-focused strategies for goal attainment.

26144548#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The application described in this study appears to be accurate and valid,, thus allowing calculation of a hearing handicap and assessment of the pure-tone air conduction threshold with iPhone/iPad devices.
26144548#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To develop and evaluate a newly developed professional,, computer-based hearing handicap calculator and a manual hearing sensitivity assessment test for the iPhone and iPad (AudCal).
26144548#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Multi-center prospective non-randomized validation study. One hundred and ten consecutive adult participants underwent two hearing evaluations,, a standard audiometry and a pure-tone air conduction test using AudCal with an iOS device. The hearing handicap calculation accuracy was evaluated comparing AudCal vs a web-based calculator.
26144548#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Hearing loss was found in 83 and 84 out of 220 standard audiometries and AudCal hearing tests (Cohen's Kappa = 0.89). The mean difference between AudCal and standard audiogram thresholds was -0.21 ± 6.38 dB HL. Excellent reliability and concordance between standard audiometry and the application's hearing loss assessment test were obtained (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96; intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.93). AudCal vs a web-based calculator were perfectly correlated (Pearson's r = 1).

33236967#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In persons with multiple sclerosis (MS),, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the criterion standard for assessing disability,, but its in-person nature constrains patient participation in research and clinical assessments.
33236967#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to develop and validate a scalable,, electronic,, unsupervised patient-reported EDSS (ePR-EDSS) that would capture MS-related disability across the spectrum of severity.
33236967#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We enrolled 136 adult MS patients,, split into a preliminary testing Cohort 1 (n?=?50),, and a validation Cohort 2 (n?=?86),, which was evenly distributed across EDSS groups. Each patient completed an ePR-EDSS either immediately before or after a MS clinician's Neurostatus EDSS evaluation.
33236967#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In Cohort 2,, mean age was 50.6?years (range = 26-80) and median EDSS was 3.5 (interquartile range (IQR) = [1.5,, 5.5]). The ePR-EDSS and EDSS agreed within 1-point for 86% of examinations; kappa for agreement within 1-point was 0.85 (p?<?0.001). The correlation coefficient between the two measures was 0.91 (<0.001).
33236967#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The ePR-EDSS was highly correlated with EDSS,, with good agreement even at lower EDSS levels. For clinical care,, the ePR-EDSS could enable the longitudinal monitoring of a patient's disability. For research,, it provides a valid and rapid measure across the entire spectrum of disability and permits broader participation with fewer in-person assessments.

29805270#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#One of the greatest barriers to safe surgery is the availability of functional biomedical equipment. Biomedical technicians play a major role in ensuring that equipment is functional. Following in-field observations and an online survey,, a mobile application was developed to aid technicians in troubleshooting biomedical equipment. It was hypothesized that this application could be used to aid technicians in equipment repair,, as modeled by repair of a pulse oximeter.
29805270#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To identify specific barriers to equipment repair and maintenance for biomedical technicians,, an online survey was conducted to determine current practices and challenges. These findings were used to guide the development of a mobile application system that guides technicians through maintenance and repair tasks. A convenience sample of technicians in Ethiopia tested the application using a broken pulse oximeter task and following this completed usability and content validity surveys.

29805270#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Fifty-three technicians from 13 countries responded to the initial survey. The results of the survey showed that technicians find equipment manuals most useful,, but these are not easily accessible. Many do not know how to or are uncomfortable reaching out to human resources. Thirty-three technicians completed the broken pulse oximeter task using the application. All were able to appropriately identify and repair the equipment,, and post-task surveys of usability and content validity demonstrated highly positive scores (Agree to Strongly Agree) on both scales.
29805270#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#This research demonstrates the need for improved access to resources for technicians and shows that a mobile application can be used to address a gap in the access to knowledge and resources in low- and middle-income countries. Further research will include prospective studies to determine the impact of an application on the availability of functional equipment in a hospital and the effect on the provision and safety of surgical care.

32854664#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Neonatal mortality is high in developing countries. Lack of adequate training and insufficient management skills for sick newborn care contribute to these deaths. We developed a phone application dubbed Protecting Infants Remotely by Short Message Service (PRISMS). The PRISMS application uses routine clinical assessments with algorithms to provide newborn clinical management suggestions. We measured the feasibility,, acceptability and efficacy of PRISMS by comparing its clinical case management suggestions with those of experienced pediatricians as the gold standard.
32854664#ABSTRACT#METHODS# Each pediatrician was randomly assigned six of twelve cases. Pediatricians developed clinical case management plans for all assigned cases and then obtained PRISMS suggested clinical case managements. We calculated percent agreement and kappa (k) statistics to test the null hypothesis that pediatrician and PRISMS management plans were independent.
32854664#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We found high level of agreement between pediatricians and PRISMS for components of newborn care including: 10% dextrose (Agreement?=?73.8%),, normal saline (Agreement?=?73.8%),, anticonvulsants (Agreement?=?100%),, blood transfusion (Agreement =81%),, phototherapy (Agreement?=?90.5%),, and supplemental oxygen (agreement?=?69.1%). However,, we found poor agreement with potential investigations such as complete blood count,, blood culture and lumbar puncture. PRISMS had a user satisfaction score of 3.8 out of 5 (range 1?=?strongly disagree,, 5?=?strongly agree) and an average PRISMS user experience score of 4.1 out of 5 (range 1?=?very bad,, 5?=?very good).

30860484#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although rates of preterm birth continue to increase globally,, identification of preterm from low birth weight infants remains a challenge. The burden of low birth weight vs preterm is greatest in resource-limited settings,, where gestational age (GA) prior to delivery is frequently not known because ultrasound in early pregnancy is not available and estimates of the date of the mother's last menstrual period (LMP) may not be reliable. An alternative option is to assess GA at birth to optimize referral and care of preterm newborns. We previously developed and pilot-tested a system to measure the simplified gestational age score (SGAS) based on 4 easily observable neonatal characteristics.
30860484#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study is to adapt the scoring system as a tablet app (potentially scalable approach) to assess feasibility of use and to validate whether the scoring system accurately predicts prematurity by itself,, over and above birth weight in a large sample of newborns.
30860484#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study is based in Nagpur,, India,, at the Research Unit of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research. The Android tablet app for the SGAS (T-SGAS) displays de-identified photographs of skin,, breasts,, and genitalia across a range of GAs and line drawings of infant posture. Each item is associated with a score. The user is trained to choose the photograph or line drawing that most closely matches the newborn being evaluated,, and the app determines the neonate's GA category (preterm or term) from the cumulative score. The validation study will be conducted in 3 second level care facilities (most deliveries in India occur in hospitals,, and women known to be at risk of preterm birth are referred to second level care facilities). Within 24 hours of delivery,, women and their babies who are stable will be enrolled in the study. Two auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) blinded to prior GA assessments will use the T-SGAS to estimate the GA status of the newborn. An independent data collector will abstract the GA from the ultrasound recorded in the hospital chart and record the date of the mother's LMP. Eligibility for analysis is determined by the ultrasound and LMP data being collected within 1 week of each other to have a rigorous assessment of true GA.
30860484#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Publication of the results of the study is anticipated in 2019.

30860484#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Until GA dating by ultrasound is universally available and easy to use in resource-limited settings,, and where there are restrictions on ultrasound use due to their use for sex determination and abortion of female fetuses,, this study will determine whether the T-SGAS app can accurately assess GA in risk categories at birth.

37129939#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Electronic record (eRecord) systems and mobile health (mHealth) apps have documented potential to improve health service delivery,, resulting in increased global uptake. However,, their interoperability remains a global challenge hindering diagnosis,, monitoring of health conditions,, and data access irrespective of geographic location. Given the widespread use of mobile devices by patients and health care providers,, linking mHealth apps and eRecord systems could result in a comprehensive and seamless data exchange within a health care community. The Botswana National eHealth Strategy recognizes interoperability as an issue and mHealth as a potential solution for some health care needs but is silent on how to make mHealth apps interoperable with existing eRecord systems. A literature review and analysis of existing mHealth interoperability frameworks found none suitable for Botswana. As such,, it was critical to conceptualize,, design,, and develop an mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) to enhance the interoperability pillar of the Botswana National eHealth Strategy and leverage the full benefits of linking mHealth apps with other health information systems.
37129939#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to validate the developed mHeRIF and determine whether it requires further refinement before consideration towards enhancing the National eHealth Strategy.
37129939#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Published framework validation approaches guided the development of a survey administered to 12 purposively selected local and international eHealth experts. In total,, 25% (3/12) of the experts were drawn from Botswana,, 25% (3/12) were drawn from low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa,, 25% (3/12) were drawn from low- and middle-income countries outside Africa,, and 25% (3/12) were drawn from high-income countries. Quantitative responses were collated in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) spreadsheet for descriptive analysis,, and the NVivo software (version 11; QSR International) was used to aid the thematic analysis of the qualitative open-ended questions.

37129939#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Overall,, the experts' reviews showed that the mHeRIF could contribute to the National eHealth Strategy by guiding the linking of mHealth apps to existing eRecord systems in Botswana. Similarly,, the experts validated an architectural model derived from the mHeRIF in support of the first mobile telemedicine initiative considered for national rollout in Botswana. The mHeRIF helps identify key components to consider before and after linking mHealth apps to eRecord systems and is being considered for use as the foundation of such interoperability in Botswana.

35006077#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A smartphone image recognition app is expected to be a novel tool for measuring nutrients and food intake,, but its performance has not been well evaluated.
35006077#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We assessed the accuracy of the performance of an image recognition app called CALO mama in terms of the nutrient and food group contents automatically estimated by the app.
35006077#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We prepared 120 meal samples for which the nutrients and food groups were calculated. Next,, we predicted the nutrients and food groups included in the meals from their photographs by using (1) automated image recognition only and (2) manual modification after automatic identification.
35006077#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Predictions generated using only image recognition were similar to the actual data on the weight of meals and were accurate for 11 out of 30 nutrients and 4 out of 15 food groups. The app underestimated energy,, 19 nutrients,, and 9 food groups,, while it overestimated dairy products and confectioneries. After manual modification,, the predictions were similar for energy,, accurately capturing the nutrients for 29 out of 30 of meals and the food groups for 10 out of 15 meals. The app underestimated pulses,, fruits,, and meats,, while it overestimated weight,, vitamin C,, vegetables,, and confectioneries.
35006077#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The results of this study suggest that manual modification after prediction using image recognition improves the performance of the app in assessing the nutrients and food groups of meals. Our findings suggest that image recognition has the potential to achieve a description of the dietary intakes of populations by using "precision nutrition" (a comprehensive and dynamic approach to developing tailored nutritional recommendations) for individuals.

30181114#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There has been an increase in consumer-facing mobile health (mHealth) apps in recent years. Prior reviews have characterized the availability,, usability,, or quality of popular mHealth apps targeting a range of health behaviors,, but none has examined apps that promote better oral health care. Oral disease affects billions of people worldwide and mobile phone use is on the rise,, so the market for well-designed and effective oral health apps is substantial.
30181114#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We examined the content and usability of popular oral health promotion apps to better understand the current state of these self-help interventions and inform the need and opportunity for future app development.
30181114#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Between February and March 2018,, we identified oral health-focused apps that were designed for Android or iOS,, available in English,, and targeted adult consumers (as opposed to children or dental health professionals). The sample was limited to the most popular and highly rated apps on each platform. For each app reviewed,, we assessed its basic descriptive characteristics (eg,, platform,, cost),, evidence of a theoretical basis or empirical validation,, key program functionality,, and the extent to which the app addressed diet and tobacco and alcohol use as risk factors for oral disease. We characterized the framing (ie,, gain vs loss) of all persuasive messaging and conducted a heuristic analysis to assess each app's usability as a persuasive health technology.
30181114#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Thirty-three apps were eligible for review based on the selection criteria. Two-thirds (22/33,, 67%) were geared toward the general public as opposed to dental clinic patients,, insurance plan members,, or owners of specific electric toothbrushes. Most (31/33,, 94%) were free to download,, and a majority (19/33,, 58%) were sponsored by software developers as opposed to oral health experts. None offered any theoretical basis for the content or had been empirically validated. Common program features included tools for tracking or reminding one to brush their teeth and assistance scheduling dental appointments. Nineteen apps (58%) included educational or persuasive content intended to influence oral health behavior. Only 32% (6/19) of these included a larger proportion of gain-framed than loss-framed messaging. Most of the apps did not mention diet,, alcohol or tobacco-important risk factors for oral disease. Overall,, the apps performed poorly on standard usability heuristics recommended for persuasive health technologies.
30181114#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The quality of the reviewed apps was generally poor. Important opportunities exist to develop oral health promotion apps that have theoretically grounded content,, are empirically validated,, and adhere to good design principles for persuasive health technologies.

35455874#ABSTRACT##People at risk of suicide tend to be isolated and cannot share their thoughts. For this reason,, suicidal ideation monitoring becomes a hard task. Therefore,, people at risk of suicide need to be monitored in a manner capable of identifying if and when they have a suicidal ideation,, enabling professionals to perform timely interventions. This study aimed to develop the Boamente tool,, a solution that collects textual data from users' smartphones and identifies the existence of suicidal ideation. The solution has a virtual keyboard mobile application that passively collects user texts and sends them to a web platform to be processed. The platform classifies texts using natural language processing and a deep learning model to recognize suicidal ideation,, and the results are presented to mental health professionals in dashboards. Text classification for sentiment analysis was implemented with different machine/deep learning algorithms. A validation study was conducted to identify the model with the best performance results. The BERTimbau Large model performed better,, reaching a recall of 0.953 (accuracy: 0.955; precision: 0.961; F-score: 0.954; AUC: 0.954). The proposed tool demonstrated an ability to identify suicidal ideation from user texts,, which enabled it to be experimented with in studies with professionals and their patients.

34805057#ABSTRACT##In Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC),, one of the causes of maternal and child mortality is a lack of medical knowledge and consequently the inability to seek timely healthcare. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is gradually becoming a universal intervention platform across the globe due to ubiquity of mobile phones and network coverage. MANTRA is a novel mHealth intervention developed to tackle maternal and child health issues through a serious mobile game app in rural Nepal,, which demonstrated a statistically significant knowledge improvement in rural women. This paper explores the perceptions and usability of the MANTRA app amongst rural women and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal. Despite the challenges of a target user group with limited educational levels and low smartphone experience,, all participants viewed the MANTRA app with approval and enthusiasm. They were willing to engage further with the mHealth intervention and to share their experience and knowledge with fellow community members. Participants also showed an increase in awareness of danger signs enabling them to make better informed health decisions in the future. FCHVs viewed the app as a validation tool providing and support for greater impact of their efforts in rural Nepal. Growing mobile ownership,, network coverage and availability of smartphones along with acceptance of the prototype MANTRA app in rural communities suggest encouraging prospects for mHealth interventions to be incorporated in the national health infrastructure in Nepal and other LMICs.

34718563#ABSTRACT##This study aimed to perform the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) for Brazilian Portuguese. The cross-cultural adaptation was conducted through conceptual equivalence,, verbatim translation,, semantic,, item and operational equivalence,, and back-translation. Subsequently,, 521 undergraduate students answered the adapted version of the eHEALS,, the General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES),, the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and sociodemographic and health-related questions. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the dimensionality,, internal consistency,, stability and concurrent/convergent/discriminant/predictive validities of the eHEALS (p < 0.05). The adequacy of sample size was confirmed by a non-identity correlation matrix (Bartlett's test of sphericity,, p < 0.001),, without influence of multicollinearity (determinant = 0.026). The confirmatory factor analysis identified four factors in agreement to the constructs namely as online searching self-efficacy,, awareness of available sources,, information usage ability,, and critical analysis of useful information. The eHEALS displayed an excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88),, a good stability (ICC = 0.71,, 95% CI: 0.49-0.84),, and it was significantly correlated with GSES (concurrent validity). Higher eHEALS scores were identified among (i) white and (ii) younger students,, (iii) from health sciences courses,, (iv) with more years of graduation,, (v) who their fathers were working in specialized functions (discriminant validity),, and (vi) among those who were frequently interested in digital health information (convergent validity). The students with higher eHealth literacy levels were more likely to seek health information in the last 24 h (predictive validity). In conclusion,, the eHEALS demonstrated adequate psychometric properties to be applied for the Brazilian population.

37410527#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Traditional longitudinal aging research involves studying the same individuals over a long period,, with measurement intervals typically several years apart. App-based studies have the potential to provide new insights into life-course aging by improving the accessibility,, temporal specificity,, and real-world integration of data collection. We developed a new research app for iOS named Labs Without Walls to facilitate the study of life-course aging. Combined with data collected using paired smartwatches,, the app collects complex data including data from one-time surveys,, daily diary surveys,, repeated game-like cognitive and sensory tasks,, and passive health and environmental data.
37410527#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this protocol is to describe the research design and methods of the Labs Without Walls study conducted between 2021 and 2023 in Australia.
37410527#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Overall,, 240 Australian adults will be recruited,, stratified by age group (18-25,, 26-35,, 36-45,, 46-55,, 56-65,, 66-75,, and 76-85 years) and sex at birth (male and female). Recruitment procedures include emails to university and community networks,, as well as paid and unpaid social media advertisements. Participants will be invited to complete the study onboarding either in person or remotely. Participants who select face-to-face onboarding (n=approximately 40) will be invited to complete traditional in-person cognitive and sensory assessments to be cross-validated against their app-based counterparts. Participants will be sent an Apple Watch and headphones for use during the study period. Participants will provide informed consent within the app and then begin an 8-week study protocol,, which includes scheduled surveys,, cognitive and sensory tasks,, and passive data collection using the app and a paired watch. At the conclusion of the study period,, participants will be invited to rate the acceptability and usability of the study app and watch. We hypothesize that participants will be able to successfully provide e-consent,, input survey data through the Labs Without Walls app,, and have passive data collected over 8 weeks; participants will rate the app and watch as user-friendly and acceptable; the app will allow for the study of daily variability in self-perceptions of age and gender; and data will allow for the cross-validation of app- and laboratory-based cognitive and sensory tasks.
37410527#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Recruitment began in May 2021,, and data collection was completed in February 2023. The publication of preliminary results is anticipated in 2023.
37410527#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study will provide evidence regarding the acceptability and usability of the research app and paired watch for studying life-course aging processes on multiple timescales. The feedback obtained will be used to improve future iterations of the app,, explore preliminary evidence for intraindividual variability in self-perceptions of aging and gender expression across the life span,, and explore the associations between performance on app-based cognitive and sensory tests and that on similar traditional cognitive and sensory tests.

33555264#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Slow-paced breathing training (6 breaths per minute [BPM]) improves physiological and psychological well-being by inducing relaxation characterized by increased heart rate variability (HRV). However,, classic breathing training has a limited target group,, and retention rates are very low. Although a gameful approach may help overcome these challenges,, it is crucial to enable breathing training in a scalable context (eg,, smartphone only) and ensure that they remain effective. However,, despite the health benefits,, no validated mobile gameful breathing training featuring a biofeedback component based on breathing seems to exist.
33555264#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to describe the design choices and their implementation in a concrete mobile gameful breathing training app. Furthermore,, it aims to deliver an initial validation of the efficacy of the resulting app.
33555264#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Previous work was used to derive informed design choices,, which,, in turn,, were applied to build the gameful breathing training app Breeze. In a pretest (n=3),, design weaknesses in Breeze were identified,, and Breeze was adjusted accordingly. The app was then evaluated in a pilot study (n=16). To ascertain that the effectiveness was maintained,, recordings of breathing rates and HRV-derived measures (eg,, root mean square of the successive differences [RMSSDs]) were collected. We compared 3 stages: baseline,, standard breathing training deployed on a smartphone,, and Breeze.
33555264#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall,, 5 design choices were made: use of cool colors,, natural settings,, tightly incorporated game elements,, game mechanics reflecting physiological measures,, and a light narrative and progression model. Breeze was effective,, as it resulted in a slow-paced breathing rate of 6 BPM,, which,, in turn,, resulted in significantly increased HRV measures compared with baseline (P<.001 for RMSSD). In general,, the app was perceived positively by the participants. However,, some criticized the somewhat weaker clarity of the breathing instructions when compared with a standard breathing training app.
33555264#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The implemented breathing training app Breeze maintained its efficacy despite the use of game elements. Moreover,, the app was positively perceived by participants although there was room for improvement.

33337340#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile health apps have emerged as useful tools for patients and clinicians alike,, sharing health information or assisting in clinical decision-making. Prostate cancer (PCa) risk calculator mobile apps have been introduced to assess risks of PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score =7). The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator and Coral-Prostate Cancer Nomogram Calculator apps were developed from the 2 most-studied PCa risk calculators,, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the North American Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculators,, respectively. A systematic review has indicated that the Rotterdam and Coral apps perform best during the prebiopsy stage. However,, the epidemiology of PCa varies among different populations,, and therefore,, the applicability of these apps in a Taiwanese population needs to be evaluated. This study is the first to validate the PCa risk calculator apps with both biopsy and prostatectomy cohorts in Taiwan.
33337340#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The study's objective is to validate the PCa risk calculator apps using a Taiwanese cohort of patients. Additionally,, we aim to utilize postprostatectomy pathology outcomes to assess the accuracy of both apps with regard to high-grade PCa.
33337340#ABSTRACT#METHODS#All male patients who had undergone transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsies in a single Taiwanese tertiary medical center from 2012 to 2018 were identified retrospectively. The probabilities of PCa and high-grade PCa were calculated utilizing the Rotterdam and Coral apps,, and compared with biopsy and prostatectomy results. Calibration was graphically evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Discrimination was analyzed utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed for clinical utility.
33337340#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of 1134 patients,, 246 (21.7%) were diagnosed with PCa; of these 246 patients,, 155 (63%) had high-grade PCa,, according to the biopsy results. After confirmation with prostatectomy pathological outcomes,, 47.2% (25/53) of patients were upgraded to high-grade PCa,, and 1.2% (1/84) of patients were downgraded to low-grade PCa. Only the Rotterdam app demonstrated good calibration for detecting high-grade PCa in the biopsy cohort. The discriminative ability for both PCa (AUC: 0.779 vs 0.687; DeLong's method: P<.001) and high-grade PCa (AUC: 0.862 vs 0.758; P<.001) was significantly better for the Rotterdam app. In the prostatectomy cohort,, there was no significant difference between both apps (AUC: 0.857 vs 0.777; P=.128).
33337340#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Rotterdam and Coral apps can be applied to the Taiwanese cohort with accuracy. The Rotterdam app outperformed the Coral app in the prediction of PCa and high-grade PCa. Despite the small size of the prostatectomy cohort,, both apps,, to some extent,, demonstrated the predictive capacity for true high-grade PCa,, confirmed by the whole prostate specimen. Following our external validation,, the Rotterdam app might be a good alternative to help detect PCa and high-grade PCa for Taiwanese men.

33507157#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Vital sign measurements are an integral component of clinical care,, but current challenges with the accuracy and timeliness of patient observations can impact appropriate clinical decision making. Advanced technologies using techniques such as photoplethysmography have the potential to automate noncontact physiological monitoring and recording,, improving the quality and accessibility of this essential clinical information.
33507157#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we aim to develop the algorithm used in the Lifelight software application and improve the accuracy of its estimated heart rate,, respiratory rate,, oxygen saturation,, and blood pressure measurements.
33507157#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This preliminary study will compare measurements predicted by the Lifelight software with standard of care measurements for an estimated population sample of 2000 inpatients,, outpatients,, and healthy people attending a large acute hospital. Both training datasets and validation datasets will be analyzed to assess the degree of correspondence between the vital sign measurements predicted by the Lifelight software and the direct physiological measurements taken using standard of care methods. Subgroup analyses will explore how the performance of the algorithm varies with particular patient characteristics,, including age,, sex,, health condition,, and medication.
33507157#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2018,, and data collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months.
33507157#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Digital health technology is a rapidly evolving area for health and social care. Following this initial exploratory study to develop and refine the Lifelight software application,, subsequent work will evaluate its performance across a range of health characteristics,, and extended validation trials will support its pathway to registration as a medical device. Innovations in health technology such as this may provide valuable opportunities for increasing the efficiency and accessibility of vital sign measurements and improve health care services on a large scale across multiple health and care settings.

35788016#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is concerning as women with GDM are at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) later in life. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent the progression of GDM to T2D. Rates of postpartum screening are suboptimal,, often as low as 13% in Asian countries. The lack of preventive care through structured postpartum screening in several health care systems and low public awareness are key barriers to postpartum diabetes screening.
35788016#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we developed a machine learning model for early prediction of postpartum T2D following routine antenatal GDM screening. The early prediction of postpartum T2D during prenatal care would enable the implementation of effective strategies for diabetes prevention interventions. To our best knowledge,, this is the first study that uses machine learning for postpartum T2D risk assessment in antenatal populations of Asian origin.
35788016#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Prospective multiethnic data (Chinese,, Malay,, and Indian ethnicities) from 561 pregnancies in Singapore's most deeply phenotyped mother-offspring cohort study-Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes-were used for predictive modeling. The feature variables included were demographics,, medical or obstetric history,, physical measures,, lifestyle information,, and GDM diagnosis. Shapley values were combined with CatBoost tree ensembles to perform feature selection. Our game theoretical approach for predictive analytics enables population subtyping and pattern discovery for data-driven precision care. The predictive models were trained using 4 machine learning algorithms: logistic regression,, support vector machine,, CatBoost gradient boosting,, and artificial neural network. We used 5-fold stratified cross-validation to preserve the same proportion of T2D cases in each fold. Grid search pipelines were built to evaluate the best performing hyperparameters.
32965240#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Incorporating cognitive testing into routine clinical practice is a challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS),, given the wide spectrum of both cognitive and physical impairments people can have and the time that testing requires. Shortened paper and verbal assessments predominate but still are not used routinely. Computer-based tests are becoming more widespread; however,, changes in how a paper test is implemented can impact what exactly is being assessed in an individual. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is one validated test that forms part of the cognitive batteries used in MS and has some computer-based versions. We developed a tablet-based SDMT variant that has the potential to be ultimately deployed to patients' own devices.

35788016#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A high performance prediction model for postpartum T2D comprising of 2 midgestation features-midpregnancy BMI after gestational weight gain and diagnosis of GDM-was developed (BMI_GDM CatBoost model: AUC=0.86,, 95% CI 0.72-0.99). Prepregnancy BMI alone was inadequate in predicting postpartum T2D risk (ppBMI CatBoost model: AUC=0.62,, 95% CI 0.39-0.86). A 2-hour postprandial glucose test (BMI_2hour CatBoost model: AUC=0.86,, 95% CI 0.76-0.96) showed a stronger postpartum T2D risk prediction effect compared to fasting glucose test (BMI_Fasting CatBoost model: AUC=0.76,, 95% CI 0.61-0.91). The BMI_GDM model was also robust when using a modified 2-point International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) 2018 criteria for GDM diagnosis (BMI_GDM2 CatBoost model: AUC=0.84,, 95% CI 0.72-0.97). Total gestational weight gain was inversely associated with postpartum T2D outcome,, independent of prepregnancy BMI and diagnosis of GDM (P=.02; OR 0.88,, 95% CI 0.79-0.98).
35788016#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Midgestation weight gain effects,, combined with the metabolic derangements underlying GDM during pregnancy,, signal future T2D risk in Singaporean women. Further studies will be required to examine the influence of metabolic adaptations in pregnancy on postpartum maternal metabolic health outcomes. The state-of-the-art machine learning model can be leveraged as a rapid risk stratification tool during prenatal care.

32965240#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper aims to develop,, validate,, and deploy a computer-based SDMT variant,, the Cognition Reaction (CoRe) test,, that can reliably replicate the characteristics of the paper-based SDMT.
32965240#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We carried out analysis using Pearson and intraclass correlations,, as well as a Bland-Altman comparison,, to examine consistency between the SDMT and CoRe tests and for test-retest reliability. The SDMT and CoRe tests were evaluated for sensitivity to disability levels and age. A novel metric in CoRe was found: question answering velocity could be calculated. This was evaluated in relation to disability levels and age for people with MS and compared with a group of healthy control volunteers.
32965240#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#SDMT and CoRe test scores were highly correlated and consistent with 1-month retest values. Lower scores were seen in patients with higher age and some effect was seen with increasing disability. There was no learning effect evident. Question answering velocity demonstrated a small increase in speed over the 90-second duration of the test in people with MS and healthy controls.
32965240#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study validates a computer-based alternative to the SDMT that can be used in clinics and beyond. It enables accurate recording of elements of cognition relevant in MS but offers additional metrics that may offer further value to clinicians and people with MS.

36819199#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Developmental assessment remains an integral part of the routine evaluation of the wellbeing of every child. Children in resource-poor countries are not routinely assessed for signs of developmental delay and developmental disorders are frequently overlooked. A major gap exists in the availability of culturally appropriate and cost-effective developmental screening tools in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) with large populations.
36819199#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To bridge the existing gap,, we describe the process of the development and validation of the Ibadan Simplified Developmental Screening (ISDS) chart,, for routine developmental screening in Nigerian children.

36819199#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed an item pool across 4 domains of development namely,, the gross motor,, vision-fine motor,, communication and socio-behavioural domains. The ISDS chart consists of 3-4 item questions for each domain of development,, and responses are to be provided by the caregiver. Each chart is age-specific,, from 6 weeks to 12 months. A total score derived from the summation of the scores in each domain are plotted on the ISDS scoring guide with a pass or fail score. Each child was evaluated by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire as the standard.
36819199#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 950 infants; 453 males and 497 females were enrolled. The estimates of internal consistency between the two instruments ranged between 0.7-1.0. Using the ASQ as the gold standard,, the ISDS chart demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.8%,, 78.4% and 99.7% in the gross motor,, communication and the social and emotional domains respectively,, for detecting infants who might require further assessment for developmental delays.
36819199#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The indigenous tool fills a major gap in the need for cost-effective interventions for developmental monitoring in LMICs. Future work should include the deployment of the tool in the wider population,, using digital health approaches that could underpin policy making in the region.

34287216#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The presence of mobile phone and smart devices has allowed for the use of mobile apps to support patient care. However,, there is a paucity in our knowledge regarding recommendations for mobile apps specific to health care professionals.
34287216#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study is to establish a validated instrument to assess mobile apps for health care providers and health systems. Our objective is to create and validate a tool that evaluates mobile health apps aimed at health care professionals based on a trust,, utility,, and interest scale.
34287216#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A five-step methodology framework guided our approach. The first step consisted of building a scale to evaluate apps for health care professionals based on a literature review. This was followed with expert panel validation through a Delphi method of (rated) web-based questionnaires to empirically evaluate the inclusion and weight of the indicators identified through the literature review. Repeated iterations were followed until a consensus greater than 75% was reached. The scale was then tested using a pilot to assess reliability. Interrater agreement of the pilot was measured using a weighted Cohen kappa.

34287216#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Using a literature review,, a first draft of the scale was developed. This was followed with two Delphi rounds between the local research group and an external panel of experts. After consensus was reached,, the resulting ISYScore-Pro 17-item scale was tested. A total of 280 apps were originally identified for potential testing (140 iOS apps and 140 Android apps). These were categorized using International Statistical Classification of Diseases,, Tenth Revision. Once duplicates were removed and they were downloaded to confirm their specificity to the target audience (ie,, health care professionals),, 66 remained. Of these,, only 18 met the final criteria for inclusion in validating the ISYScore-Pro scale (interrator reliabilty 92.2%; kappa 0.840,, 95% CI 0.834-0.847; P<.001).
34287216#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#We have developed a reproducible methodology to objectively evaluate mobile health apps targeted to health care professionals and providers,, the ISYScore-Pro scale. Future research will be needed to adapt the scale to other languages and across other domains (eg,, legal compliance or security).

36964203#ABSTRACT##For the last 40 years,, actigraphy or wearable accelerometry has provided an objective,, low-burden and ecologically valid approach to assess real-world sleep and circadian patterns,, contributing valuable data to epidemiological and clinical insights on sleep and sleep disorders. The proper use of wearable technology in sleep research requires validated algorithms that can derive sleep outcomes from the sensor data. Since the publication of the first automated scoring algorithm by Webster in 1982,, a variety of sleep algorithms have been developed and contributed to sleep research,, including many recent ones that leverage machine learning and / or deep learning approaches. However,, it remains unclear how these algorithms compare to each other on the same data set and if these modern data science approaches improve the analytical validity of sleep outcomes based on wrist-worn acceleration data. This work provides a systematic evaluation across 8 state-of-the-art sleep algorithms on a common sleep data set with polysomnography (PSG) as ground truth. Despite the inclusion of recently published complex algorithms,, simple regression-based and heuristic algorithms demonstrated slightly superior performance in sleep-wake classification and sleep outcome estimation. The performance of complex machine learning and deep learning models seem to suffer from poor generalization. This independent and systematic analytical validation of sleep algorithms provides key evidence on the use of wearable digital health technologies for sleep research and care.

36292172#ABSTRACT##The use of smartphone-based applications as a telenutrition tool could redefine the nutritional management of IBD. We developed and validated a digital health platform in the form of a smartphone application for the nutritional assessment of IBD patients. Our team of gastroenterologists and dieticians at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences,, New Delhi developed a smartphone application titled IBD NutriCare,, which was made available in both Android and iOS interfaces in English and seven other Indian languages. The application includes >650 Indian recipes and provides subjective global assessment and IBD clinical activity scores in a patient-friendly manner. The utility of the smartphone app was validated in comparison with the traditional 24-h dietary recall method. A total of 49 IBD patients were enrolled in the study. The mean difference in energy intake between the two dietary assessment methods was -4.776 kJ (95% LOA,, range -417.916-408.365 kJ). A total of 94% of patients found the smartphone application convenient and acceptable in comparison to the recall method for dietary assessment. Bland-Altman plots showed a good level of agreement for nutrients and food groups between the two methods. Telenutrition in the form of a smartphone application helps in real-time tracking of dietary details of IBD patients,, thus making appropriate interventions and large-scale data acquisition feasible.

36065060#ABSTRACT##Movement health is understanding our body's ability to perform movements during activities of daily living such as lifting,, reaching,, and bending. The benefits of improved movement health have long been recognized and are wide-ranging from improving athletic performance to helping ease of performing simple tasks,, but only recently has this concept been put into practice by clinicians and quantitatively studied by researchers. With digital health and movement monitoring becoming more ubiquitous in society,, smartphone applications represent a promising avenue for quantifying,, monitoring,, and improving the movement health of an individual. In this paper,, we validate Halo Movement,, a movement health assessment which utilizes the front-facing camera of a smartphone and applies computer vision and machine learning algorithms to quantify movement health and its sub-criteria of mobility,, stability,, and posture through a sequence of five exercises/activities. On a diverse cohort of 150 participants of various ages,, body types,, and ability levels,, we find moderate to strong statistically significant correlations between the Halo Movement assessment overall score,, metrics from sensor-based 3D motion capture,, and scores from a sequence of 13 standardized functional movement tests. Further,, the smartphone assessment is able to differentiate regular healthy individuals from professional movement athletes (e.g.,, dancers,, cheerleaders) and from movement impaired participants,, with higher resolution than that of existing functional movement screening tools and thus may be more appropriate than the existing tests for quantifying functional movement in able-bodied individuals. These results support using Halo Movement's overall score as a valid assessment of movement health.
33644087#ABSTRACT##There is optimism that artificial intelligence (AI) will result in positive clinical outcomes,, which is driving research and investment in the use of AI for skin disease. At present,, AI for skin disease is embedded in research and development and not practiced widely in clinical dermatology. Clinical dermatology is also undergoing a technological transformation in terms of the development and adoption of standards that optimizes the quality use of imaging. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the international standard for medical imaging. DICOM is a continually evolving standard. There is considerable effort being invested in developing dermatology-specific extensions to the DICOM standard. The ability to encode relevant metadata and afford interoperability with the digital health ecosystem (e.g.,, image repositories,, electronic medical records) has driven the initial impetus in the adoption of DICOM for dermatology. DICOM has a dedicated working group whose role is to develop a mechanism to support AI workflows and encode AI artifacts. DICOM can improve AI workflows by encoding derived objects (e.g.,, secondary images,, visual explainability maps,, AI algorithm output) and the efficient curation of multi-institutional datasets for machine learning training,, testing,, and validation. This can be achieved using DICOM mechanisms such as standardized image formats and metadata,, metadata-based image retrieval,, and de-identification protocols. DICOM can address several important technological and workflow challenges for the implementation of AI. However,, many other technological,, ethical,, regulatory,, medicolegal,, and workforce barriers will need to be addressed before DICOM and AI can be used effectively in dermatology.

31890637#ABSTRACT##Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a lifelong neurological condition affecting around 2.2 million people worldwide. There are a wide range of symptoms,, with fatigue reported as one of the most troublesome. MS Energize-or MS Energise in UK English regions-is an iPhone app focused on self-management of fatigue for people with MS. Based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles,, the app covers MS fatigue,, how to use energy effectively,, how behavior,, thoughts and emotions interact and impact on MS fatigue,, as well as the potential effects of bodily and environmental factors. MS Energize provides education,, interactive tasks,, and supports application of the principles into a user's day-to-day life. We field tested the usability and perceived usefulness of MS Energize with 11 people with longstanding multiple sclerosis in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Participants used the app over a period of five to six weeks after which they rated the usability of the app and participated in an in-depth qualitative interview. We developed four main themes through our thematic analysis. 1. Validation of participants' own experiences of living with MS fatigue. 2. The personal cost in engaging with such an intervention. 3. Reframing experiences and adding to knowledge. 4. That the app was generally a good idea. Field testers' feedback also identified usability issues that could be addressed. In particular,, the amount of text-based content in the app contributed to the app itself being fatiguing. This field-testing process has highlighted the value of the app while also guiding our roadmap for further developments to enhance usability and usefulness. The next step is further refinement of components of MS Energize in preparation for a trial of its clinical and cost effectiveness.

36881449#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#It has been validated that the GRVOTS mobile app contains gamification and motivation elements,, which are intended to encourage medication adherence to TB treatment.
36881449#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to document the process of designing,, developing,, and validating the gamification,, motivation,, and real-time elements in the Gamified Real-time Video Observed Therapies (GRVOTS) mobile app.
36881449#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The modified nominal group technique via a panel of 11 experts was used to validate the presence of the gamification and motivation elements inside the app,, which were assessed based on the percentage of agreement among the experts.
36881449#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The GRVOTS mobile app,, which can be used by patients,, supervisors,, and administrators,, was successfully developed. For validation purposes,, the gamification and motivation features of the app were validated as they achieved a total mean percentage of agreement of 97.95% (SD 2.51%),, which was significantly higher than the minimum agreement score of 70% (P<.001). Further,, each component of gamification,, motivation,, and technology was also rated at 70% or more. Among the gamification elements,, fun received the lowest scores,, possibly because the nature of serious games does not prioritize the fun element and because the perception of fun varies by personality. The least popular element in motivation was relatedness,, as stigma and discrimination hinder interaction features,, such as leaderboards and chats,, in the mobile app.

36745491#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Vital signs and NEWSs measured using the wearable device were compared with standard,, nurse-lead manual measurements. We enrolled adult patients (aged =18 years) who required vital sign measurements at least every 6 hours in a UK teaching district general hospital. Wearable device measurements were not used for clinical decision-making. The primary outcome was the agreement on the individual National Early Warning parameter scores and vital sign measurements: respiratory rate,, oxygen saturation,, body temperature,, systolic blood pressure,, and heart rate. Secondary outcomes were the agreement on the total NEWS,, incidence of adverse events,, and user acceptance. To compare the wearable device measurements with the standard measurements,, we analyzed vital sign measurements by limits of agreement (Bland-Altman analysis) and conducted ? agreement analyses for NEWSs. A user experience survey was conducted with questions about comfort of the wrist device,, safety,, preference,, and use.
36745491#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We included 132 participants in the study,, with a mean age of 62 (SD 15.81) years; most of them were men (102/132,, 77.3%). The highest weighted ? values were found for heart rate (0.69,, 95% CI 0.57-0.81 for all 385 measurements) and systolic blood pressure (0.39,, 95% CI 0.30-0.47 for all 339 measurements). Weighted ? values were low for respiration rate (0.03,, 95% CI -0.001 to 0.05 for all 445 measurements),, temperature (0,, 95% CI 0-0 for all 231 measurements),, and oxygen saturation (-0.11,, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.02 for all 187 measurements). Weighted ? using Cicchetti-Allison weights showed ? of 0.20 (95% CI 0.03-0.38) when using all 56 total NEWSs. The user acceptance survey found that approximately half (45/91,, 49%) of the participants found it comfortable to wear the device and liked its appearance. Most (85/92,, 92%) of them said that they would wear the device during their next hospital visit,, and many (74/92,, 80%) said that they would recommend it to others.
36745491#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study shows the promising use of a prototype wearable device to measure vital signs in a hospital setting. Agreement between the standard measurements and wearable device measurements was acceptable for systolic blood pressure and heart rate,, but needed to be improved for respiration rate,, temperature,, and oxygen saturation. Future studies need to improve the clinical validity of this wearable device. Large studies are required to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of wearable devices for vital sign measurement.

34530644#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#) that enables people with diabetes to achieve health goals for self-care. We aimed to validate Healthy Coping-related feedback messages from diabetes mobile apps against the framework based on behavioral change theories.
34530644#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We searched apps using the search terms: "diabetes,," "blood sugar,," "glucose,," and "mood" from iTunes and Google Play stores. We entered a range of values on 3 Healthy Coping domains: (1) diabetes-related measures including blood glucose,, blood pressure,, HbA1c,, weight,, (2) physical exercise/activity,, and (3) mood to generate feedback messages. We used a framework by adopting validated behavioral change theory-based models to evaluate the feedback messages against 3 dimensions of timing,, intention,, and content (feedback purpose and feedback response). The feedback purposes in this study were categorized into 7 purposes; warning,, suggestion,, self-monitoring,, acknowledging,, reinforcement,, goal setting,, and behavior contract.
34530644#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified 1,,749 apps from which 156 diabetes mobile apps were eligible and generated 473 feedback messages. The majority of generated feedback messages were related to blood sugar measurement. Only feedback messages on blood sugar under diabetes-related measures and mood domains encompassed all 7 feedback purposes under the content dimension.
34530644#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Many feedback messages neither supported Healthy Coping domains nor followed the behavioral theory-based framework. It is important that feedback messages be structured around the dimensions of the behavioral theory-based framework to promote behavior change. Furthermore,, our framework had the generalizability that can be used in other clinical areas.

28106758#ABSTRACT##Image-based dietary records could lower participant burden associated with traditional prospective methods of dietary assessment. They have been used in children,, adolescents and adults,, but have not been evaluated in pregnant women. The current study evaluated relative validity of the DietBytes image-based dietary assessment method for assessing energy and nutrient intakes. Pregnant women collected image-based dietary records (via a smartphone application) of all food,, drinks and supplements consumed over three non-consecutive days. Intakes from the image-based method were compared to intakes collected from three 24-h recalls,, taken on random days; once per week,, in the weeks following the image-based record. Data were analyzed using nutrient analysis software. Agreement between methods was ascertained using Pearson correlations and Bland-Altman plots. Twenty-five women (27 recruited,, one withdrew,, one incomplete),, median age 29 years,, 15 primiparas,, eight Aboriginal Australians,, completed image-based records for analysis. Significant correlations between the two methods were observed for energy,, macronutrients and fiber (r = 0.58-0.84,, all p < 0.05),, and for micronutrients both including (r = 0.47-0.94,, all p < 0.05) and excluding (r = 0.40-0.85,, all p < 0.05) supplements in the analysis. Bland-Altman plots confirmed acceptable agreement with no systematic bias. The DietBytes method demonstrated acceptable relative validity for assessment of nutrient intakes of pregnant women.

27287964#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study describes the development and reliability testing of an end-user version of the MARS (uMARS).
27287964#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The MARS was simplified and piloted with 13 young people to create the uMARS. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the uMARS was then examined in a second sample of 164 young people participating in a randomized controlled trial of a mHealth app. App ratings were collected using the uMARS at 1-,, 3,,- and 6-month follow up.
27287964#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The uMARS had excellent internal consistency (alpha = .90),, with high individual alphas for all subscales. The total score and subscales had good test-retest reliability over both 1-2 months and 3 months.

35936321#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Privacy concerns are an important barrier to adoption and continued use of digital technologies,, particularly in the health sector. With the introduction of mobile health applications (mHealth apps),, the construct of app information privacy concerns has received increased attention. However,, few validated measures exist to capture said concerns in population samples,, although they can help to improve public health efforts.
35936321#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Using a cross-sectional survey of German adults (mean age = 35.62; 63.5% female),, this study examined psychometric properties of the app information privacy concerns scale (AIPC). Analyses comprised confirmatory factor analysis,, factorial validity (exploratory factor analysis),, internal consistency,, convergent validity (i.e.,, correlations with privacy victimhood,, and app privacy concerns),, and discriminant validity (i.e.,, daily app use,, adoption intentions,, and attitudes toward COVID-19 contact tracing app use).
35936321#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The analysis did not support the proposed three-factor structure of the AIPC (i.e.,, anxiety,, personal attitude,, and requirements). Instead,, a four-factor model was preferable that differentiated requirements regarding disclosure policies,, and personal control. In addition,, factors mirroring anxiety and personal attitude were extracted,, but shared a significant overlap. However,, these factors showed good reliability,, convergent and discriminant validity.
35936321#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The findings underline the role of app information privacy concerns as a significant barrier to mHealth app use. In this context,, anxiety and personal attitudes seemed particularly relevant,, which has implications for health communication. Moreover,, the observed differentiation of external (disclosure) and internal (control) requirements aligns with health behavior change models and thus is a promising area for future research.

32574925#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) does not necessarily translate to proficiency -referred to here as EMR maturity. To realize the full benefit of wide scale EMR adoption,, the focus must shift from adoption to advancing mature use. This calls for validated assessment models so that researchers,, health system planners and digital health developers can better understand what contributes to maturity among physicians. This research aims to validate a measurement model for self-assessed EMR maturity among community-based physicians.
32574925#ABSTRACT#METHODS#As part of an Ontario government-funded EMR adoption program,, the EMR Maturity Model for community-based practices was adapted from a hospital-based EMR maturity model. A survey instrument was developed on the foundation of the new model and revised by experts and stakeholders. Content validity,, face validity and user acceptance were established before survey administration. Internal consistency and construct validity of the model were tested after survey data were collected. Finally,, physicians' comments collected via the survey were qualitatively analyzed to provide additional insights that can be applied to refinement of the model and survey.
32574925#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#As of August 1,, 2019,, 1588 physicians completed the survey. Ordinal alpha tests for reliability and content validity yielded an alpha value of 0.86 across all key measures specifically associated with maturity. Among most of these,, there was a pattern of weak to moderate significant (p < .0001) positive Spearman inter-correlations. One factor was extracted for items measuring dimensions of maturity and all factor loadings of the key measures were greater than 0.40. The fit of the one-factor model was moderately adequate. This indicates the model is valid and reliable,, with consistency across key measures for measuring one factor: maturity.
32574925#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This is the first known validated model published in English that measures EMR maturity among community-based physicians. While the model is shown to be valid and reliable statistically and qualitative analysis supports this,, there is room for improvement. Both the statistical analysis and portions of the qualitative analysis suggest areas of exploration to strengthen the model and survey. Future efforts will include refining the survey to improve user interface and accrue further data,, as the sample to date is insufficient for generalizability.

36705954#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Physical inactivity is associated with numerous health risks,, including cancer,, cardiovascular disease,, type 2 diabetes,, increased health care expenditure,, and preventable,, premature deaths. The majority of Americans fall short of clinical guideline goals (ie,, 8000-10,,000 steps per day). Behavior prediction algorithms could enable efficacious interventions to promote physical activity by facilitating delivery of nudges at appropriate times.
36705954#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this paper is to develop and validate algorithms that predict walking (ie,, >5 min) within the next 3 hours,, predicted from the participants' previous 5 weeks' steps-per-minute data.
36705954#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a retrospective,, closed cohort,, secondary analysis of a 6-week microrandomized trial of the HeartSteps mobile health physical-activity intervention conducted in 2015. The prediction performance of 6 algorithms was evaluated,, as follows: logistic regression,, radial-basis function support vector machine,, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),, multilayered perceptron (MLP),, decision tree,, and random forest. For the MLP,, 90 random layer architectures were tested for optimization. Prior 5-week hourly walking data,, including missingness,, were used for predictors. Whether the participant walked during the next 3 hours was used as the outcome. K-fold cross-validation (K=10) was used for the internal validation. The primary outcome measures are classification accuracy,, the Mathew correlation coefficient,, sensitivity,, and specificity.
36705954#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The total sample size included 6 weeks of data among 44 participants. Of the 44 participants,, 31 (71%) were female,, 26 (59%) were White,, 36 (82%) had a college degree or more,, and 15 (34%) were married. The mean age was 35.9 (SD 14.7) years. Participants (n=3,, 7%) who did not have enough data (number of days <10) were excluded,, resulting in 41 (93%) participants. MLP with optimized layer architecture showed the best performance in accuracy (82.0%,, SD 1.1),, whereas XGBoost (76.3%,, SD 1.5),, random forest (69.5%,, SD 1.0),, support vector machine (69.3%,, SD 1.0),, and decision tree (63.6%,, SD 1.5) algorithms showed lower performance than logistic regression (77.2%,, SD 1.2). MLP also showed superior overall performance to all other tried algorithms in Mathew correlation coefficient (0.643,, SD 0.021),, sensitivity (86.1%,, SD 3.0),, and specificity (77.8%,, SD 3.3).
36705954#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Walking behavior prediction models were developed and validated. MLP showed the highest overall performance of all attempted algorithms. A random search for optimal layer structure is a promising approach for prediction engine development. Future studies can test the real-world application of this algorithm in a "smart" intervention for promoting physical activity.

34840941#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA),, the most prevalent form of sleep-related breathing disorder has practical and financial limitations in diagnosis by polysomnography,, hence OSA risk-assessment can identify OSA-related symptoms early.
34840941#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#To develop a mobile application for OSA-risk assessment and tests its validity,, feasibility,, and application in a hospital-based pilot sample.
34840941#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS#The study comprised of two parts.
34840941#ABSTRACT#PART I#Development of a mobile application "OSA-Risk Assessment Tool" using automated questionnaires.
34840941#ABSTRACT#PART II#A pilot study to screen OSA-risk in 200 patients (100 adults,,100 children) from the orthodontic OPD of a Govt. Dental Hospital,, using the mobile application. Internal validation by manual and mobile-based methods was done on 30 random patients. Non-parametric tests assessed the statistical differences between OSA-risk and nonOSA-risk variables.
34840941#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The prevalence of OSA-risk was 21.4% in adults and 8% in children. In adults,, OSA-risk showed significantly greater neck circumference (p = 0.0001),, waist circumference(p = 0.001),, body mass index(p = 0.008),, daytime sleepiness,, headache,, and mouth breathing(p = 0.0001). In children,, OSA-risk is associated with a dry mouth on awakening,, daytime sleepiness,, and mouth breathing,, and nocturnal enuresis. The low OSA-risk patients were suggested standardized preventive management counseling and orthodontic interventions while medium to high-risk underwent sleep-specialist referrals.
34840941#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study supports the feasibility and usability of the mobile application "OSA-risk assessment tool" in a hospital setup. This cost-effective tool can be advocated for self-evaluation,, early detection,, and awareness in pandemic times. The future upgraded versions may include preventive modules and real-time coordination with the nearest sleep clinics and specialists.

28302595#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#There is a critical need for real-time tracking of behavioral indicators of mental disorders. Mobile sensing platforms that objectively and noninvasively collect,, store,, and analyze behavioral indicators have not yet been clinically validated or scalable.
28302595#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of our study was to report on models of clinical symptoms for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression derived from a scalable mobile sensing platform.
28302595#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 73 participants (67% [49/73] male,, 48% [35/73] non-Hispanic white,, 33% [24/73] veteran status) who reported at least one symptom of PTSD or depression completed a 12-week field trial. Behavioral indicators were collected through the noninvasive mobile sensing platform on participants' mobile phones. Clinical symptoms were measured through validated clinical interviews with a licensed clinical social worker. A combination hypothesis and data-driven approach was used to derive key features for modeling symptoms,, including the sum of outgoing calls,, count of unique numbers texted,, absolute distance traveled,, dynamic variation of the voice,, speaking rate,, and voice quality. Participants also reported ease of use and data sharing concerns.
28302595#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Behavioral indicators predicted clinically assessed symptoms of depression and PTSD (cross-validated area under the curve [AUC] for depressed mood=.74,, fatigue=.56,, interest in activities=.75,, and social connectedness=.83). Participants reported comfort sharing individual data with physicians (Mean 3.08,, SD 1.22),, mental health providers (Mean 3.25,, SD 1.39),, and medical researchers (Mean 3.03,, SD 1.36).
28302595#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Behavioral indicators passively collected through a mobile sensing platform predicted symptoms of depression and PTSD. The use of mobile sensing platforms can provide clinically validated behavioral indicators in real time; however,, further validation of these models and this platform in large clinical samples is needed.

31014333#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#As part of the mobile revolution,, smartphone-based applications (apps) have become almost indispensable in today's information society. Consequently,, the use of medical apps among healthcare professionals has increased heavily over the past years. As little is known on medical app use in day-to-day clinical practice in Austria,, the present study aims at closing this knowledge gap by assessing respective prevalence,, readiness,, and concerns among Austrian practitioners.

31014333#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a sample of 151 Austrian doctors (mean age 45.0,, SD 12.0,, 55.0% females). We developed a German study questionnaire on the basis of the Practitioner Telehealth Readiness Assessment Tool (PRAT) to assess medical app use-related readiness and attitudes,, and validated it using principal component analysis.
31014333#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In our study,, 74% of participants used medical apps on a daily basis,, with clarity,, ease of use,, speed,, and support in clinical routine mentioned as most important app features. However,, the majority of participants perceived certain barriers to use medical apps. Younger participants used more medical apps,, were more likely to use them during work,, and yielded higher readiness scores. The most often used medical apps were Diagnosia and Embryotox (both 28.5%).
31014333#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Nowadays,, medical apps serve as an important source of information for many doctors and are especially popular among younger physicians. The omnipresence of smartphones in the smocks of healthcare workers raised awareness for potential shortcomings regarding disruption of traditional face-to-face doctor-patient interaction among all healthcare stakeholders. This study's finding thus highlight the need for initiating a public discussion on legal and social frameworks to successfully integrate mobile apps into everyday clinical.

29929948#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of the pilot study was to test,, in a real,, controlled environment,, the implementation of AppSalut. Specifically,, we tested whether (1) the procedures corresponding to the prescription,, transmission,, and evaluation of the data functions correctly,, (2) users interact successfully and accept the tool,, and (3) the data travels through existing pathways in accordance with international standards. The evaluation is not based on clinical criteria,, but rather on the usability and technological reliability of the intervention and its implementation in the context of primary care.
29929948#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The project was presented to the Primary Care Team participants to encourage the involvement of doctors. The study involved at least 5 doctors and 5 patients per professional,, chosen at their discretion and in accordance with their own clinical criteria. An initial consultation took place,, during which the doctor discussed the pilot project with the patient and recommended the app. The patient was sent a text message (SMS,, short message service) containing an access code. When the patient arrived home,, they accessed their personal health record (PHR) to view the recommendation,, download the app,, and enter the access code. The patient was then able to start using the app. The data was collected in a standardized manner and automatically sent to the system. In a second visit,, the patient looked at the data with their doctor on their clinical station screen. The latter was able to consult the information generated by the patient and select what to include in their electronic health record. In order to assess the performance of the system,, three focus groups were performed and two ad-hoc case-specific questionnaires,, one for doctors and one for patients,, were sent by email. Response was voluntary.
29929948#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 32 doctors made 79 recommendations of apps to patients. On average,, the patients uploaded data 13 times per prescribed app,, accounting for a total of 16 different variables. Results show that data traveled through the established channels in an adequate manner and in accordance with international standards. This includes the prescription of an app by a doctor,, the patient accessing the recommendation via the PHR,, app download by the patient from the official app stores,, linking of the patient to the public platform through the app,, the generation and visualization of the data on the primary care workstation,, and its subsequent validation by the clinician.
29929948#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#First,, the choice of apps to be used is fundamental; the user's perception of the utility of the proposed tool being paramount. Second,, thorough face-to-face support is vital for a smooth transition towards a more intense model of telemedicine. Last,, a powerful limiting factor is the lack of control over people's ability to use the apps.

34992790#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The newly developed AF-EduApp,, available for Android and iOS,, consists of six different modules. The prototype was validated and optimized for its usability and functionality at Jessa Hospital Hasselt and Antwerp University Hospital in two phases: (1) validity evaluation with interviews of an expert panel with 15 healthcare professionals and 10 atrial fibrillation patients,, and (2) a pilot study of 1 month with 20 atrial fibrillation patients.
34992790#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Both experts and patients found that the application aids atrial fibrillation management. Based on the input of patients and experts,, the main optimizations concerned the medication module (patient choice on setting reminder; interactivity of reminders with a "taken" or "snooze" function) and development of a clinical dashboard for the caregivers allowing telemonitoring of measurements and feedback to the patients. After the pilot study (n?=?20),, 16 patients indicated they wanted to use the app for a longer period. The measurement (27%) and education (17%) modules were the two most used modules with a significant improvement in knowledge (71.9% to 87.5%; P?=?0.013).
34992790#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The AF-EduApp received a positive evaluation from health professionals and atrial fibrillation patients. Further development should be focused on the medication module and improvement of the clinical dashboard.

The objective of this study was to develop a digital transformation of the patients' follow-up service after cardiac surgery,, based on a remote patient monitoring service that would respond to the real context challenges.
35597936#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study followed the Design Science Research methodology framework and incorporated concepts from the Lean startup method to start designing a minimal viable product (MVP) from the available resources. The service was implemented in a pilot study with 29 patients in 4 iterative develop-test-learn cycles,, with the engagement of developers,, researchers,, clinical teams,, and patients.
35597936#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Patients reported outcomes daily for 30?days after surgery through Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and a mobile app. The service's evaluation considered experience,, feasibility,, and effectiveness. It generated high satisfaction and high adherence among users,, fewer readmissions,, with an average of 7?±?4.5 clinical actions per patient,, primarily due to abnormal systolic blood pressure or wound-related issues.

32755418#ABSTRACT##Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is an essential part of diagnosing and managing hypertension. In the era of advanced digital health information technology,, the approach to achieving this is shifting from traditional methods (ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring) to wearable devices and technology. Wearable blood pressure monitors allow frequent blood pressure measurements (ideally continuous beat-by-beat monitoring of blood pressure) with minimal stress on the patient. It is expected that wearable devices will dramatically change the quality of detection and management of hypertension by increasing the number of measurements in different situations,, allowing accurate detection of phenotypes that have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis,, such as masked hypertension and abnormal blood pressure variability. Frequent blood pressure measurements and the addition of new features such as monitoring of environmental conditions allows interpretation of blood pressure data in the context of daily stressors and different situations. This new digital approach to hypertension contributes to anticipation medicine,, which refers to strategies designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of cardiovascular events based on a series of data collected over time,, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk. To achieve this,, further research and validation is required to develop wearable blood pressure monitoring devices that provide the same accuracy as current approaches and can effectively contribute to personalized medicine.

36364728#ABSTRACT##Digital health technologies may support the management and prevention of disease through personalized lifestyle interventions. Wearables and smartphones are increasingly used to continuously monitor health and disease in everyday life,, targeting health maintenance. Here,, we aim to demonstrate the potential of wearables and smartphones to (1) detect eating moments and (2) predict and explain individual glucose levels in healthy individuals,, ultimately supporting health self-management. Twenty-four individuals collected continuous data from interstitial glucose monitoring,, food logging,, activity,, and sleep tracking over 14 days. We demonstrated the use of continuous glucose monitoring and activity tracking in detecting eating moments with a prediction model showing an accuracy of 92.3% (87.2-96%) and 76.8% (74.3-81.2%) in the training and test datasets,, respectively. Additionally,, we showed the prediction of glucose peaks from food logging,, activity tracking,, and sleep monitoring with an overall mean absolute error of 0.32 (+/-0.04) mmol/L for the training data and 0.62 (+/-0.15) mmol/L for the test data. With Shapley additive explanations,, the personal lifestyle elements important for predicting individual glucose peaks were identified,, providing a basis for personalized lifestyle advice. Pending further validation of these digital biomarkers,, they show promise in supporting the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes through personalized lifestyle recommendations.

36712159#ABSTRACT#AIMS#Patients with congestive heart failure (HF) are prone to clinical deterioration leading to hospital admissions,, burdening both patients and the healthcare system. Predicting hospital admission in this patient group could enable timely intervention,, with subsequent reduction of these admissions. To date,, hospital admission prediction remains challenging. Increasing amounts of acquired data and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology allow for the creation of reliable hospital prediction algorithms for HF patients. This scoping review describes the current literature on strategies and performance of AI-based algorithms for prediction of hospital admission in patients with HF.
36712159#ABSTRACT#METHODS AND RESULTS#PubMed,, EMBASE,, and the Web of Science were used to search for articles using machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods to predict hospitalization in patients with HF. After eligibility screening,, 23 articles were included. Sixteen articles predicted 30-day hospital (re-)admission resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.61 to 0.79. Six studies predicted hospital admission over longer time periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years,, with AUC's ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. One study prospectively evaluated performance of a disposable sensory patch at home after hospitalization which resulted in an AUC of 0.89 for unplanned hospital admission prediction.
36712159#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#AI has the potential to enable prediction of hospital admission in HF patients. Improvement of data management,, adding new data sources such as telemonitoring data and ML models and prospective and external validation of current models must be performed before clinical applicability is possible.

30417159#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Biochemical verification of smoking abstinence remains an important validity check of cessation trial outcomes. Digital health trials rarely establish in-person contacts between participants and intervention providers,, requiring novel strategies to biochemically verify outcomes. We describe remote verification of smoking abstinence via saliva cotinine and individual predictors of compliance in a digital intervention.

35935648#ABSTRACT##Recent progress in digital health data recording,, advances in computing power,, and methodological approaches that extract information from data as artificial intelligence are expected to have a disruptive impact on technology in medicine. One of the potential benefits is the ability to extract new and essential insights from the vast amount of data generated during health care delivery every day. Cardiovascular imaging is boosted by new intelligent automatic methods to manage,, process,, segment,, and analyze petabytes of image data exceeding historical manual capacities. Algorithms that learn from data raise new challenges for regulatory bodies. Partially autonomous behavior and adaptive modifications and a lack of transparency in deriving evidence from complex data pose considerable problems. Controlling new technologies requires new controlling techniques and ongoing regulatory research. All stakeholders must participate in the quest to find a fair balance between innovation and regulation. The regulatory approach to artificial intelligence must be risk-based and resilient. A focus on unknown emerging risks demands continuous surveillance and clinical evaluation during the total product life cycle. Since learning algorithms are data-driven,, high-quality data is fundamental for good machine learning practice. Mining,, processing,, validation,, governance,, and data control must account for bias,, error,, inappropriate use,, drifts,, and shifts,, particularly in real-world data. Regulators worldwide are tackling twenty-first century challenges raised by "learning" medical devices. Ethical concerns and regulatory approaches are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future of responsible artificial intelligence.
30417159#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data came from a feasibility trial and randomized controlled trial of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention for young adults. In both trials,, participants completed baseline and follow-up surveys at 3,, 6 and 12 months. Participants indicating past 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence were mailed a saliva cotinine kit. Participants were instructed to electronically send two photos - one of them giving a saliva sample and the other with the test results. We investigated predictors of compliance with these procedures,, independent of verification results,, among participants that were mailed a kit at any follow-up point (N=130; mean age = 21.3; 59.2% female) using logistic and multinomial regression.
30417159#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 189 kits were sent out,, of which 97 were completed (51.3% compliance). We did not identify significant predictors of completing any vs no kits using logistic regression. We also found no significant predictors of extent of kit completion (none vs some; none vs all) using multinomial regression and controlling for number of kits sent.
30417159#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Findings demonstrate the feasibility of this biochemical verification method and suggest low risk for bias of results. Future studies should replicate findings in larger samples and improve compliance with verification procedures.

35080505#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#A platform designed to support the home management of oral anticancer treatments and provide a secure web-based patient-health care professional communication modality,, ONCO-TreC,, was tested in 3 cancer centers in Italy.
35080505#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The overall aims of the trial are to customize the platform; assess the system's ability to facilitate the shared management of oral anticancer therapies by patients and health professionals; and evaluate system usability and acceptability by patients,, caregivers,, and health care professionals.
35080505#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Patients aged =18 years who were candidates for oral anticancer treatment as monotherapy with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 to 1 and a sufficient level of familiarity with mobile devices were eligible. ONCO-TreC consisted of a mobile app for patients and a web-based dashboard for health care professionals. Adherence to treatment (pill count) and toxicities reported by patients through the app were compared with those reported by physicians in medical records. Usability and acceptability were evaluated using questionnaires.
35080505#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 40 patients were enrolled,, 38 (95%) of whom were evaluable for adherence to treatment. The ability of the system to measure adherence to treatment was high,, with a concordance of 97.3% (95% CI 86.1%-99.9%) between the investigator and system pill count. Only 60% (3/5) of grade 3,, 54% (13/24) of grade 2,, and 19% (7/36) of grade 1 adverse events reported by physicians in the case report forms were also reported in the app directly by patients. In total,, 94% (33/35) of patients had =1 app launch each week,, and the median number of daily accesses per patient was 2. Approximately 71% (27/38) and 68% (26/38) of patients used the app for messages and vital sign entering,, respectively,, at least once during the study period.
35080505#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#ONCO-TreC is an important tool for measuring and monitoring adherence to oral anticancer drugs. System usability and acceptability were very high,, whereas its reliability in registering toxicity could be improved.

35072630#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Rigorous development of mobile technologies requires the use of validated instruments to evaluate the usability of these tools,, which has become more relevant with the expansion of these technologies. Although various usability evaluation tools have been developed,, there are relatively few simple evaluation instruments that have been validated across diseases and languages in mobile health (mHealth) information technology for use in multiple diseases.
35072630#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The purpose of this study is to validate the Korean version of the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Korean Health-ITUES) and assess its applicability for different health conditions.
35072630#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To develop the Korean Health-ITUES,, we used a validation process involving the following 3 steps: (1) customization of the Health-ITUES for menstrual symptoms,, (2) translation of the Health-ITUES from English into Korean,, and (3) examination of the reliability and validity of the instrument. The translation process adhered to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for translation and back-translation,, expert review,, and reconciliation.
35072630#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Korean Health-ITUES showed reliable internal consistency with Cronbach a=.951; meanwhile,, factor loadings of the 20 items in the 4 subscales ranged from 0.416 to 0.892.
35072630#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Health-ITUES demonstrated reliability and validity for its use in assessing mHealth apps' usability in young Korean women with menstrual discomfort. Given the strong psychometric properties of this tool in Korean and English and across 2 different health conditions,, the Health-ITUES is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing the usability of mHealth apps. The Health-ITUES is also a valid instrument for evaluating mHealth technologies,, which are widely used by patients to self-manage their health and by providers to improve health care delivery.

35855755#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#An electronic health record (EHR) system known as the e-Tracker was introduced in community health facilities in Ghana and numerous advantages were expected for clinical staff,, as evidenced by previous literature. However,, little is known about public health officials' views,, specifically in low-resource settings. This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of district health officers on data quality,, use,, and management following the adoption of tablet-based electronic health records in Ghana.
35855755#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A pre- and post-survey was conducted in two regions of Ghana that adopted the e-Tracker for the entire districts during the early stages of the national rollout. Sociodemographic information,, internet connection environment,, and perceptions on data quality,, use,, and management were measured. McNemar's test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test were performed to identify changes in perceptions. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to find any statistical differences in demographic characteristics between the two regions.
35855755#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Twenty-four out of 25 districts in Volta and 24 out of 26 districts in Eastern regions participated in both pre- and post-surveys,, with a total of 73 participants. In terms of efficiency in data management,, the district health officers reported reduced time commitment in data validation and aggregation. Within less than a year,, however,, no statistically significant improvement was found in data quality and the use of electronic data for relevant tasks.
35855755#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#A new EHR system in low-resource settings can rapidly improve efficiency in data management from the public health officials' perspectives. Further impact evaluation is warranted to assess the long-term effect of the EHR system.

31217992#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVES#A home-based tool for heart failure (HF) patients,, was evaluated in a specialist setting as a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and also in a validation cohort in a primary care setting in a clinical controlled trial (CCT). The tool provides education,, symptom monitoring and titration of diuretics. The aim of this study was thus to extend validity of the previous RCT findings in order to describe applicability of the tool in clinical practice.
31217992#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data from both trials were analysed separately,, as well as a pooled data set (n=172). Data were analysed with respect to HF related in-hospital days,, self-care behaviour and system adherence,, during a 6-month intervention. The analysis of in-hospital days for the pooled data was adjusted for baseline differences between the two study cohorts,, relating to disease state.

31217992#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the RCT (n=72) the intervention group (IG) consisted of 32 patients and the control group (CG) of 40 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for in-hospital days was RR: 0.72,, 95%?CI 0.61 to 0.84,, p<0.05 in favour of the IG. In the CCT (n=100) both the IG and the CG consisted of 50 patients and the IG had fewer in-hospitals days,, comparable to the RCT findings with RR: 0.67; 95%?CI 0.45 to 0.99; p<0.05. For the pooled data set made up of 172 patients,, the groups were well balanced but with a higher prevalence of hypertension in the CG. The RR relating to in-hospital days for the pooled data set was 0.71; 95%?CI 0.61 to 0.82; p<0.05 in favour of the IG. There was a statistically significant improvement in self-care by 27% and the median system adherence was 94%.
31217992#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#These analyses suggest that the evaluated tool might reduce HF related in-hospital days in the general HF population,, which adds to the external validity of previous findings.Clinical Trial Registration NCT03655496.

31066700#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Blended group therapy (bGT) has been investigated a several times for anxiety and depression,, but information on patients' adherence to and therapists' perception of the novel format is nonexistent. Furthermore,, many studies investigated mainly female and highly educated populations,, limiting the validity of previous findings.
31066700#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to reduce the gaps and limitations of the previous findings by evaluating an integrated internet- and mobile-supported bGT format.
31066700#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 27 patients diagnosed with major depression (14/27,, 52% female and 7/27,, 25.9% compulsory education) participated in a 7-week treatment at a university outpatient clinic. Furthermore,, 8 novice therapists participated in semistructured interviews and a subsequent cross-validation survey.
31066700#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Primary symptom reduction was high (d=1.31 to 1.51) and remained stable for the follow-up period. Therapists identified advantages (eg,, patient engagement,, treatment intensification,, and improved therapeutic relation) and disadvantages (eg,, increased workload,, data issues,, and undesired effects) of bGT. The required online guidance time was 10.3 min per patient and week,, including guidance on exercises (67% or 6.9 min) and intimate communication (33% or 3.4 min). Concerning patients' adherence to bGT,, tracked completion of all Web-based and mobile tasks was high and comparable with group attendance.
31066700#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Results suggest high feasibility of bGT in a gender-balanced,, moderately educated sample. bGT provides group therapists with tools for individual care,, resulting in an optimization of the therapy process,, and high completion rates of the implemented bGT elements. The limited work experience of the involved therapists restricts the study findings,, and potential drawbacks need to be regarded in the development of future bGT interventions.

36320102#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The establishment of a valuable and meaningful working alliance between people with mild intellectual disabilities (IDs) and healthcare professionals is critically important for improving both the quality of life and impact of therapy for people with mild IDs. Measuring the working alliance as a treatment or support component is therefore of utmost relevance. In light of the increased use of eHealth tools,, it is also essential to measure the alliance using these tools,, which is referred to as technical alliance. There was a lack of validation of these two measurements for healthcare professionals working with people with mild IDs,, which this study sought to address.
36320102#ABSTRACT#METHOD#Both the validated Working Alliance Inventory - Short Form - MID (WAI-SF-MID) and Technical Alliance Inventory - Short Form - MID (TAI-SF-MID) for general patient populations were adapted for healthcare professionals working with people with mild IDs. A two-step approach was conducted to systematically adapt both measurements with an expert group of healthcare professionals. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test a three-factor structure for both the WAI-SF-MID (N = 199) and the TAI-SF-MID (N = 139),, and internal consistency was determined for both scales.

36011162#ABSTRACT##Prescription opioid nonadherence,, specifically opioid misuse,, has contributed to the opioid epidemic and opioid-related mortality in the US. Popular methods to measure and control opioid adherence have limitations,, but mobile health,, specifically smartphone applications,, offers a potentially useful technology for this purpose. We developed,, tested,, and validated the OpPill application using the Mobile Applications Rating Scale (MARS),, a validated tool for assessing the quality of mobile health apps. The MARS contains four scales (range of each scale = 0-4) that rate Engagement,, Functionality,, Aesthetics,, and Information Quality. It also assesses subjective quality,, relevance,, and overall application impact. Our application was built to be a mobile monitoring and reporting system intended to enhance opioid adherence by collecting data and providing systematic feedback on pain and opioid use. Patients (n = 28) all had one of various SCD genotypes,, were ages 19 to 59 years (mean 36.56),, 53.6% were female,, and 39.3% had completed some college. Patients rated the OpPill application highly on all four scales: Engagement,, 3.93 ± 0.73; Functionality,, 4.54 ± 0.66; Aesthetics,, 3.92 ± 0.81; Information,, 3.91 ± 0.87. The majority of patients found the application to be relevant for their care. A total of 96% reported the information within the app was complete,, while 4% estimated the information to be minimal or overwhelming. Patients (91.7%) overwhelmingly reported that the quality of information as it pertained to SCD patients was relevant; only 8.3% found the application to be poorly relevant to SCD. Similarly,, patients (91.7%) overwhelmingly rated both the application's performance and ease of use positively. The large majority of participants (85.7%) found the application to be interesting to use,, while 74% found it entertaining. All users found the application's navigation to be logical and accurate with consistent and intuitive gestural design. We conclude that the OpPill application,, specifically targeted to monitor opioid use and pain and opioid behavior in patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain,, was feasible and rated by SCD patients as easy-to-use using a validated rating tool.
36320102#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#An acceptable-to-good model fit was found for both the WAI-SF-MID and the TAI-SF-MID; confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a three-factor model for both measurements. Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were excellent for both total scales (=0.90) and acceptable to good for sub-scales of both versions.
36320102#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Both the WAI-SF-MID and the TAI-SF-MID are promising measurements for determining healthcare professionals' perspective on the (digital) working alliance with people with mild IDs.

26033047#ABSTRACT##Personal Health Intervention Toolkit (PHIT) is an advanced cross-platform software framework targeted at personal self-help research on mobile devices. Following the subjective and objective measurement,, assessment,, and plan methodology for health assessment and intervention recommendations,, the PHIT platform lets researchers quickly build mobile health research Android and iOS apps. They can (1) create complex data-collection instruments using a simple extensible markup language (XML) schema; (2) use Bluetooth wireless sensors; (3) create targeted self-help interventions based on collected data via XML-coded logic; (4) facilitate cross-study reuse from the library of existing instruments and interventions such as stress,, anxiety,, sleep quality,, and substance abuse; and (5) monitor longitudinal intervention studies via daily upload to a Web-based dashboard portal. For physiological data,, Bluetooth sensors collect real-time data with on-device processing. For example,, using the BinarHeartSensor,, the PHIT platform processes the heart rate data into heart rate variability measures,, and plots these data as time-series waveforms. Subjective data instruments are user data-entry screens,, comprising a series of forms with validation and processing logic. The PHIT instrument library consists of over 70 reusable instruments for various domains including cognitive,, environmental,, psychiatric,, psychosocial,, and substance abuse. Many are standardized instruments,, such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test,, Patient Health Questionnaire-8,, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Autonomous instruments such as battery and global positioning system location support continuous background data collection. All data are acquired using a schedule appropriate to the app's deployment. The PHIT intelligent virtual advisor (iVA) is an expert system logic layer,, which analyzes the data in real time on the device. This data analysis results in a tailored app of interventions and other data-collection instruments. For example,, if a user anxiety score exceeds a threshold,, the iVA might add a meditation intervention to the task list in order to teach the user how to relax,, and schedule a reassessment using the anxiety instrument 2 weeks later to re-evaluate. If the anxiety score exceeds a higher threshold,, then an advisory to seek professional help would be displayed. Using the easy-to-use PHIT scripting language,, the researcher can program new instruments,, the iVA,, and interventions to their domain-specific needs. The iVA,, instruments,, and interventions are defined via XML files,, which facilities rapid app development and deployment. The PHIT Web-based dashboard portal provides the researcher access to all the uploaded data. After a secure login,, the data can be filtered by criteria such as study,, protocol,, domain,, and user. Data can also be exported into a comma-delimited file for further processing. The PHIT framework has proven to be an extensible,, reconfigurable technology that facilitates mobile data collection and health intervention research. Additional plans include instrument development in other domains,, additional health sensors,, and a text messaging notification system.

37221504#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Online health communities (OHCs) provide platforms for patients to seek advice from physicians and receive professional suggestions online. It can improve the efficiency of patients' diagnosis of simple diseases and alleviate hospital congestion. However,, few empirical studies have comprehensively explored the factors influencing patients' intention to use OHCs through objective data. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying key factors that influence patients' acceptance of OHCs and proposing effective ways to promote the applications of OHCs in China.
37221504#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology (UTAUT),, extended with additional constructs identified with patients' information demands in OHCs,, this study developed a research model and proposed nine hypotheses. An online survey involving 783 valid responses was conducted in China to collect data to validate the proposed model. Confirmatory factor analysis and partial least squares (PLS) path model were conducted for instrument validation and hypothesis testing.
37221504#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Price value,, eHealth literacy,, and performance expectancy are the most prominent constructs in the study context. Interestingly,, relation quality was also found to have a significant positive relationship with behavioral intention.
37221504#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Based on these findings,, OHC operators need to create a user-friendly platform,, improve information quality,, set reasonable prices,, and establish consummate security systems. Physicians and related organizations can raise awareness and assist patients in developing the skills to appropriately comprehend and utilize information in OHCs. This study contributes to both technology adoption theory and practice.

35436234#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in altered behavior,, social development,, and communication patterns. In recent years,, autism prevalence has tripled,, with 1 in 44 children now affected. Given that traditional diagnosis is a lengthy,, labor-intensive process that requires the work of trained physicians,, significant attention has been given to developing systems that automatically detect autism. We work toward this goal by analyzing audio data,, as prosody abnormalities are a signal of autism,, with affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies such as echolalia,, monotonous intonation,, atypical pitch,, and irregular linguistic stress patterns.
35436234#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to test the ability for machine learning approaches to aid in detection of autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from children with ASD and neurotypical (NT) children in their home environments.
35436234#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We considered three methods to detect autism in child speech: (1) random forests trained on extracted audio features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); (2) convolutional neural networks trained on spectrograms; and (3) fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0-a state-of-the-art transformer-based speech recognition model. We trained our classifiers on our novel data set of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from the Guess What? mobile game,, an app designed to crowdsource videos of children with ASD and NT children in a natural home environment.
35436234#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The random forest classifier achieved 70% accuracy,, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model achieved 77% accuracy,, and the convolutional neural network achieved 79% accuracy when classifying children's audio as either ASD or NT. We used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
35436234#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our models were able to predict autism status when trained on a varied selection of home audio clips with inconsistent recording qualities,, which may be more representative of real-world conditions. The results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer promise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized equipment.

34916802#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#COST demonstrated very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha?=?.89) and good convergent validity. Lower financial toxicity was associated with improved physical and mental well-being HRQOL measures after controlling for covariates (b?=?0.13,, P?<?.0001; b?=?0.28,, P?<?.0001,, respectively). Supplemental analyses indicated that the COST instrument loaded on 2 factors.
34916802#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The COST measure of financial toxicity has good internal consistency and predictive validity in a sample of patients with chronic conditions. However,, contrary to previous research examining the psychometric properties of COST in a sample of individuals with cancer,, which found COST to be unidimensional,, our analyses indicated that the COST measure of financial toxicity is multidimensional in a sample of individuals with chronic conditions. In particular,, the items that asked about "general financial wellbeing" loaded on the second factor while "illness-related financial wellbeing" loaded on the first.

36346657#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#QR codes have played an integral role during the pandemic in many sectors,, but their use has been limited in the health care sector,, especially by patients. Although some authors have stated that developing specific content for women on how to cope with health problems could be an effective way to prevent problems,, especially during pandemics,, there is little research regarding the use of QR codes to promote health during a pandemic,, and even fewer studies are focused on women. Moreover,, although the importance of assessing these interventions from the users' perspective has been stated,, research carried out from this point of view is still scarce.
36346657#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to assess the usefulness of using QR codes with information to promote women's health in the context of a pandemic. We also sought to design and validate a questionnaire to assess this.
36346657#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional study was conducted among women in the gynecology waiting rooms of a reference hospital. Exploratory factorial analysis with the split-half method and Cronbach a values was performed for questionnaire validation. Univariant and bivariant analyses were performed to analyze the data obtained.
36346657#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 186 women took part in the study. Exploratory factor analysis identified 2 domains: usability and applicability in medical practice. The Cronbach a value was .81. Overall,, 83.7% of the answers to the first domain and 56.4% of those to the second were favorable. Women with university education or those who had used QR codes before scored better in the usability domain,, while no differences were observed in the applicability scores.
36346657#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Using QR codes in the gynecology clinics' waiting rooms can help promote women's health during a pandemic,, regardless of their education level or whether they have used QR codes before. The questionnaire developed herein is a helpful tool to assess this. These findings are important for clinical practice. This research can be performed in other ambits,, specialties,, or countries.

32432551#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Although alarm safety is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to improve patient care,, hospitals have not given serious consideration about how their staff should be using,, setting,, and responding to clinical alarms. Studies have indicated that 80%-99% of alarms in hospital units are false or clinically insignificant and do not represent real danger for patients,, leading caregivers to miss relevant alarms that might indicate significant harmful events. The lack of use of any intelligent filter to detect recurrent,, irrelevant,, and/or false alarms before alerting health providers can culminate in a complex and overwhelming scenario of sensory overload for the medical team,, known as alarm fatigue.
32432551#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper's main goal is to propose a solution to mitigate alarm fatigue by using an automatic reasoning mechanism to decide how to calculate false alarm probability (FAP) for alarms and whether to include an indication of the FAP (ie,, FAP_LABEL) with a notification to be visualized by health care team members designed to help them prioritize which alerts they should respond to next.
32432551#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We present a new approach to cope with the alarm fatigue problem that uses an automatic reasoner to decide how to notify caregivers with an indication of FAP. Our reasoning algorithm calculates FAP for alerts triggered by sensors and multiparametric monitors based on statistical analysis of false alarm indicators (FAIs) in a simulated environment of an intensive care unit (ICU),, where a large number of warnings can lead to alarm fatigue.
32432551#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The main contributions described are as follows: (1) a list of FAIs we defined that can be utilized and possibly extended by other researchers,, (2) a novel approach to assess the probability of a false alarm using statistical analysis of multiple inputs representing alarm-context information,, and (3) a reasoning algorithm that uses alarm-context information to detect false alarms in order to decide whether to notify caregivers with an indication of FAP (ie,, FAP_LABEL) to avoid alarm fatigue.
32432551#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Experiments were conducted to demonstrate that by providing an intelligent notification system,, we could decide how to identify false alarms by analyzing alarm-context information. The reasoner entity we described in this paper was able to attribute FAP values to alarms based on FAIs and to notify caregivers with a FAP_LABEL indication without compromising patient safety.

These drugs included Atazanavir,, Remdesivir,, Efavirenz,, Ritonavir,, and Dolutegravir,, PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib and CVL218 which is Mefuparib hydrochloride),, Abacavir,, Roflumilast,, Almitrine,, and Mesylate. Many vaccines were developed utilizing the new technology of bioinformatics,, databases,, immune-informatics,, machine learning,, and reverse vaccinology to the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteomes or the structural proteins. Examples of these vaccines are the messenger RNA and viral vector vaccines. AI provides cost-saving and agility. However,, the challenges of its usage are the difficulty of collecting data,, the internal and external validation,, ethical consideration,, therapeutic effect,, and the time needed for clinical trials after drug approval. Moreover,, there is a common problem in the deep learning (DL) model which is the shortage of interpretability.
35078755#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The growth of AI techniques in health care opened a broad gate for discovering the genomic sequences of the COVID-19 virus and the VOC. AI helps also in the development of vaccines and drugs (including drug repurposing) to obtain potential preventive and therapeutic agents for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

31430260#ABSTRACT##BACKGROUNDCircadian timing of treatments can largely improve tolerability and efficacy in patients. Thus,, drug metabolism and cell cycle are controlled by molecular clocks in each cell and coordinated by the core body temperature 24-hour rhythm,, which is generated by the hypothalamic pacemaker. Individual circadian phase is currently estimated with questionnaire-based chronotype,, center-of-rest time,, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO),, or timing of core body temperature (CBT) maximum (acrophase) or minimum (bathyphase).METHODSWe aimed at circadian phase determination and readout during daily routines in volunteers stratified by sex and age. We measured (a) chronotype,, (b) every minute (q1min) CBT using 2 electronic pills swallowed 24 hours apart,, (c) DLMO through hourly salivary samples from 1800 hours to bedtime,, and (d) q1min accelerations and surface temperature at anterior chest level for 7 days,, using a teletransmitting sensor. Circadian phases were computed using cosinor and hidden Markov modeling. Multivariate regression identified the combination of biomarkers that best predicted core temperature circadian bathyphase.RESULTSAmong the 33 participants,, individual circadian phases were spread over 5 hours,, 10 minutes (DLMO); 7 hours (CBT bathyphase); and 9 hours,, 10 minutes (surface temperature acrophase). CBT bathyphase was accurately predicted,, i.e.,, with an error less than 1 hour for 78.8% of the subjects,, using a new digital health algorithm (INTime),, combining time-invariant sex and chronotype score with computed center-of-rest time and surface temperature bathyphase (adjusted R2 = 0.637).CONCLUSIONINTime provided a continuous and reliable circadian phase estimate in real time. This model helps integrate circadian clocks into precision medicine and will enable treatment timing personalization following further validation.FUNDINGMedical Research Council,, United Kingdom; AP-HP Foundation; and INSERM.

35580238#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#The digital health revolution has brought forward integral technological advancements enabling virtual care as a readily accessible delivery model. Despite this forward momentum,, the field of audiology still faces barriers that impede the uptake of virtual services into routine clinical practice. The aim of this study was to gather,, synthesize,, and summarize the literature around virtual hearing aid intervention studies and the related technology and infrastructure requirements.
35580238#ABSTRACT#METHOD#A scoping review was conducted using MEDLINE,, CINAHL,, Scopus,, Nursing and Allied Health,, and Web of Science databases. Objectives,, inclusion criteria,, and scoping review methods were specified in advance and documented in a protocol.
35580238#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The 11 studies identified through this review related to virtual hearing aid services delivered by a licensed health care provider and/or facilitator(s) specific to hearing aid management,, programming,, verification,, and validation services. Service delivery models varied according to patient population,, technology experience,, type(s) and time course of care,, type of remote location,, and technology/support requirements. Barriers and facilitators to implementation-related themes including technology access and function,, client sociotechnical,, convenience,, education and training,, interaction quality,, service delivery,, and technology innovation.
35580238#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This scoping review provides evidence around the technology and infrastructure required for full integration of virtual hearing aid services into practice and according to care type. Low-tech versus high-tech requirements may be used to guide virtual service delivery triaging efforts. Research and development efforts in the areas of pediatrics,, clinical support tools,, and hearing aid/app-based solutions will support further uptake of virtual service delivery in audiology.

37440310#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Multimorbidity is associated with an increased risk of poor surgical outcomes among older adults; however,, identifying multimorbidity in the clinical setting can be a challenge.
37440310#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We created the Multimorbid Patient Identifier App (MMApp) to easily identify patients with multimorbidity identified by the presence of a Qualifying Comorbidity Set and tested its feasibility for use in future clinical research,, validation,, and eventually to guide clinical decision-making.

37440310#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We adapted the Qualifying Comorbidity Sets' claims-based definition of multimorbidity for clinical use through a modified Delphi approach and developed MMApp. A total of 10 residents input 5 hypothetical emergency general surgery patient scenarios,, common among older adults,, into the MMApp and examined MMApp test characteristics for a total of 50 trials. For MMApp,, comorbidities selected for each scenario were recorded,, along with the number of comorbidities correctly chosen,, incorrectly chosen,, and missed for each scenario. The sensitivity and specificity of identifying a patient as multimorbid using MMApp were calculated using composite data from all scenarios. To assess model feasibility,, we compared the mean task completion by scenario to that of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-NSQIP-SRC) using paired t tests. Usability and satisfaction with MMApp were assessed using an 18-item questionnaire administered immediately after completing all 5 scenarios.
37440310#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#There was no significant difference in the task completion time between the MMApp and the ACS-NSQIP-SRC for scenarios A (86.3 seconds vs 74.3 seconds,, P=.85) or C (58.4 seconds vs 68.9 seconds,,P=.064),, MMapp took less time for scenarios B (76.1 seconds vs 87.4 seconds,, P=.03) and E (20.7 seconds vs 73 seconds,, P<.001),, and more time for scenario D (78.8 seconds vs 58.5 seconds,, P=.02). The MMApp identified multimorbidity with 96.7% (29/30) sensitivity and 95% (19/20) specificity. User feedback was positive regarding MMApp's usability,, efficiency,, and usefulness.
37440310#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MMApp identified multimorbidity with high sensitivity and specificity and did not require significantly more time to complete than a commonly used web-based risk-stratification tool for most scenarios. Mean user times were well under 2 minutes. Feedback was overall positive from residents regarding the usability and usefulness of this app,, even in the emergency general surgery setting. It would be feasible to use MMApp to identify patients with multimorbidity in the emergency general surgery setting for validation,, research,, and eventual clinical use. This type of mobile app could serve as a template for other research teams to create a tool to easily screen participants for potential enrollment.

34710783#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Designing a health promotion campaign is never an easy task,, especially during a pandemic of a highly infectious disease such as COVID-19. In Saudi Arabia,, many attempts have been made to raise public awareness about COVID-19 infection and precautionary health measures. However,, most of the health information delivered through the national dashboard and the COVID-19 awareness campaigns are generic and do not necessarily make the impact needed to be seen on individuals' behavior. Health messages need to be applicable and reverent to the individual in the audience.
34710783#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In light of Fogg-Behavior model,, this research aims to build and validate a behavior-change-based messaging campaign to promote precautionary health behavior in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention messages can then be targeted appropriately during the pandemic.
34710783#ABSTRACT#METHODS#An initial library of 32 text-based and video-based messages were developed and validated based on Fogg behavior model for behavior change. Based on this model,, three groups of messages were created to reflect the model's three theoretical concepts of motivation,, ability and triggers. Each group of messages is designed to target different segment of the audience. The content of the messages was developed based on resources from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The validity of this content was evaluated by domain experts through the content validity index.
34710783#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Fogg-Behavior Model was used to segment the audience into three different groups based on their perceived ability and motivation. The three groups of messages designed for those groups were found relevant to Fogg theoretical concepts. Thirteen professional health care workers (n = 13) evaluated the content of the message libraries in Arabic and English. Thirty-two messages were found to have acceptable content validity (I-CVI = 0.87).
34710783#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This research introduced Fogg Behavior Model as a behavior change model to develop targeted messages for three groups of the audience based on their motivation and ability level toward maintaining precautionary behavior during the pandemic. This targeted awareness messaging campaign can be utilized by health authorities to raise individuals' awareness about the precautionary measures that should be taken,, maintain these measures and hence help in reducing the number of positive cases in the city of Jeddah.

35360007#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The eHealthResp platform and the courses,, developed with a user-centered design and based on Wordpress and MySQL,, were based on a previously developed online course. A questionnaire to assess the usability was distributed among physicians (n?=?6) and pharmacists (n?=?6). Based on the obtained results,, statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the usability score and appraise the design of the online course,, as well as to compare the overall scores attributed by both groups. Further qualitative comments provided by the participants have also been analyzed.
35360007#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The eHealthResp contains two online courses directed to physicians and pharmacists aiming to aid in the management of respiratory tract infections. The average usability score of the eHealthResp online courses for physicians and pharmacists was of 78.33 (±11.57,, 95%CI),, and 83.75 (±15.90,, 95%CI),, respectively. Qualitative feedback emphasized the usefulness of the course,, including overall positive reviews regarding user-friendliness and consistency.
35360007#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study led us to conclude that the eHealthResp online course is not recognized as a complex web platform,, as both qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained were globally positive.

28293596#ABSTRACT##Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive,, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that is diagnosed and measured clinically by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Tools for continuous and objective monitoring of PD motor symptoms are needed to complement clinical assessments of symptom severity to further inform PD therapeutic development across several arenas,, from developing more robust clinical trial outcome measures to establishing biomarkers of disease progression. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease Research and Intel Corporation have joined forces to develop a mobile application and an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to support large-scale studies of objective,, continuously sampled sensory data from people with PD. This platform provides both population and per-patient analyses,, measuring gait,, activity level,, nighttime activity,, tremor,, as well as other structured assessments and tasks. All data collected will be available to researchers on an open-source platform. Development of the IoT platform raised a number of engineering considerations,, including wearable sensor choice,, data management and curation,, and algorithm validation. This project has successfully demonstrated proof of concept that IoT platforms,, wearable technologies and the data they generate offer exciting possibilities for more robust,, reliable,, and low-cost research methodologies and patient care strategies.
37440294#ABSTRACT##The impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on medicine is unprecedented and ever-increasing. This has made it more and more difficult for doctors to keep pace with ICT developments and to adequately match the input of ICT experts. As a result,, medical disciplines may not be able to take full advantage of growing possibilities. In this personal viewpoint paper,, I argue for the establishment of a novel medical specialty,, ICT medicine. ICT medicine is needed to optimally face the challenges of ICT-based developments,, including artificial intelligence (AI),, and to ensure their efficient and beneficial use. ICT medicine is rooted in both medicine and ICT,, and in contrast to existing medical specialties it is integrative in nature,, as long-standing structural collaborations with ICT and other stakeholders cross the boundaries between disciplines. Thus,, new concepts and theories may evolve that are better suited to addressing ICT-related issues in medicine. ICT doctors will be instrumental in the conception,, development,, implementation,, and evaluation of digital tools,, systems,, and services. They provide a bridge between ICT professionals and clinical users and educate doctors in digital applications and services. Notably,, ICT doctors may have a pivotal role in the validation,, verification,, and evaluation of AI models. ICT medicine institutes offer a home to these new professionals,, enhancing their independence within health care organizations and in relation to ICT companies. Importantly,, in an era of growing technicalization and use of AI algorithms,, ICT doctors may safeguard the human factor in medicine. And,, from a societal perspective,, they may promote digital inclusion and the continuing high quality of digital services and provide leadership in the future digitalization of medicine.

34552539#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital self-help interventions for reducing the use of alcohol tobacco and other drugs (ATOD) have generally shown positive but small effects in controlling substance use and improving the quality of life of participants. Nonetheless,, low adherence rates remain a major drawback of these digital interventions,, with mixed results in (prolonged) participation and outcome. To prevent non-adherence,, we developed models to predict success in the early stages of an ATOD digital self-help intervention and explore the predictors associated with participant's goal achievement.
34552539#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We included previous and current participants from a widely used,, evidence-based ATOD intervention from the Netherlands (Jellinek Digital Self-help). Participants were considered successful if they completed all intervention modules and reached their substance use goals (i.e.,, stop/reduce). Early dropout was defined as finishing only the first module. During model development,, participants were split per substance (alcohol,, tobacco,, cannabis) and features were computed based on the log data of the first 3 days of intervention participation. Machine learning models were trained,, validated and tested using a nested k-fold cross-validation strategy.
34552539#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#From the 32,,398 participants enrolled in the study,, 80% of participants did not complete the first module of the intervention and were excluded from further analysis. From the remaining participants,, the percentage of success for each substance was 30% for alcohol,, 22% for cannabis and 24% for tobacco. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was the highest for the Random Forest model trained on data from the alcohol and tobacco programs (0.71 95%CI 0.69-0.73) and (0.71 95%CI 0.67-0.76),, respectively,, followed by cannabis (0.67 95%CI 0.59-0.75). Quitting substance use instead of moderation as an intervention goal,, initial daily consumption,, no substance use on the weekends as a target goal and intervention engagement were strong predictors of success.
34552539#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#Using log data from the first 3 days of intervention use,, machine learning models showed positive results in identifying successful participants. Our results suggest the models were especially able to identify participants at risk of early dropout. Multiple variables were found to have high predictive value,, which can be used to further improve the intervention.

28239919#ABSTRACT#PARTICIPANTS#Four hundred and seven participants were randomized to the intervention (n = 203) or usual care (n = 204). Eligible women were < 25 weeks gestation,, smoked at least one daily cigarette (> 5 pre-pregnancy),, were able to receive and understand English SMS texts and were not already using text-based cessation support.
28239919#ABSTRACT#INTERVENTION#All participants received a smoking cessation leaflet; intervention participants also received a 12-week programme of individually tailored,, automated,, interactive,, self-help smoking cessation text messages (MiQuit).
28239919#ABSTRACT#OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS#Seven smoking outcomes,, including validated continuous abstinence from 4 weeks post-randomization until 36 weeks gestation,, design parameters for a future trial and cost-per-quitter.
28239919#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#Using the validated,, continuous abstinence outcome,, 5.4% (11 of 203) of MiQuit participants were abstinent versus 2.0% (four of 204) of usual care participants [odds ratio (OR) = 2.7,, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-9.35]. The Bayes factor for this outcome was 2.23. Completeness of follow-up at 36 weeks gestation was similar in both groups; provision of self-report smoking data was 64% (MiQuit) and 65% (usual care) and abstinence validation rates were 56% (MiQuit) and 61% (usual care). The incremental cost-per-quitter was £133.53 (95% CI = -£395.78 to 843.62).

33523020#ABSTRACT##The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and related mobility issues places a serious burden on healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the urgent need for better tools to manage chronic conditions remotely,, as regular access to clinics may be problematic. Digital health technology in the form of remote monitoring with body-worn sensors offers significant opportunities for transforming research and revolutionizing the clinical management of PD. Significant efforts are being invested in the development and validation of digital outcomes to support diagnosis and track motor and mobility impairments "off-line". Imagine being able to remotely assess your patient,, understand how well they are functioning,, evaluate the impact of any recent medication/intervention,, and identify the need for urgent follow-up before overt,, irreparable change takes place? This could offer new pragmatic solutions for personalized care and clinical research. So the question remains: how close are we to achieving this? Here,, we describe the state-of-the-art based on representative papers published between 2017 and 2020. We focus on remote (i.e.,, real-world,, daily-living) monitoring of PD using body-worn sensors (e.g.,, accelerometers,, inertial measurement units) for assessing motor symptoms and their complications. Despite the tremendous potential,, existing challenges exist (e.g.,, validity,, regulatory) that are preventing the widespread clinical adoption of body-worn sensors as a digital outcome. We propose a roadmap with clear recommendations for addressing these challenges and future directions to bring us closer to the implementation and widespread adoption of this important way of improving the clinical care,, evaluation,, and monitoring of PD.

29853485#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveforms.
29853485#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect AF in 17?s PPG waveforms using a training data set of 149?048 PPG waveforms constructed from several publicly available PPG databases. The DCNN was validated using an independent test data set of 3039 smartphone-acquired PPG waveforms from adults at high risk of AF at a general outpatient clinic against ECG tracings reviewed by two cardiologists. Six established AF detectors based on handcrafted features were evaluated on the same test data set for performance comparison.

29853485#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In the validation data set (3039 PPG waveforms) consisting of three sequential PPG waveforms from 1013 participants (mean (SD) age,, 68.4 (12.2) years; 46.8% men),, the prevalence of AF was 2.8%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DCNN for AF detection was 0.997 (95% CI 0.996 to 0.999) and was significantly higher than all the other AF detectors (AUC range: 0.924-0.985). The sensitivity of the DCNN was 95.2% (95% CI 88.3% to 98.7%),, specificity was 99.0% (95% CI 98.6% to 99.3%),, positive predictive value (PPV) was 72.7% (95% CI 65.1% to 79.3%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.9% (95% CI 99.7% to 100%) using a single 17?s PPG waveform. Using the three sequential PPG waveforms in combination (<1?min in total),, the sensitivity was 100.0% (95% CI 87.7% to 100%),, specificity was 99.6% (95% CI 99.0% to 99.9%),, PPV was 87.5% (95% CI 72.5% to 94.9%) and NPV was 100% (95% CI 99.4% to 100%).
29853485#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#In this evaluation of PPG waveforms from adults screened for AF in a real-world primary care setting,, the DCNN had high sensitivity,, specificity,, PPV and NPV for detecting AF,, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted features.

24870413#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Early and effective identification of developmental disorders during childhood remains a critical task for the international community. The second highest prevalence of common developmental disorders in children are language delays,, which are frequently the first symptoms of a possible disorder.
24870413#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper evaluates a Web-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) whose aim is to enhance the screening of language disorders at a nursery school. The common lack of early diagnosis of language disorders led us to deploy an easy-to-use CDSS in order to evaluate its accuracy in early detection of language pathologies. This CDSS can be used by pediatricians to support the screening of language disorders in primary care.
24870413#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This paper details the evaluation results of the "Gades" CDSS at a nursery school with 146 children,, 12 educators,, and 1 language therapist. The methodology embraces two consecutive phases. The first stage involves the observation of each child's language abilities,, carried out by the educators,, to facilitate the evaluation of language acquisition level performed by a language therapist. Next,, the same language therapist evaluates the reliability of the observed results.

24870413#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The Gades CDSS was integrated to provide the language therapist with the required clinical information. The validation process showed a global 83.6% (122/146) success rate in language evaluation and a 7% (7/94) rate of non-accepted system decisions within the range of children from 0 to 3 years old. The system helped language therapists to identify new children with potential disorders who required further evaluation. This process will revalidate the CDSS output and allow the enhancement of early detection of language disorders in children. The system does need minor refinement,, since the therapists disagreed with some questions from the CDSS knowledge base (KB) and suggested adding a few questions about speech production and pragmatic abilities. The refinement of the KB will address these issues and include the requested improvements,, with the support of the experts who took part in the original KB development.
24870413#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This research demonstrated the benefit of a Web-based CDSS to monitor children's neurodevelopment via the early detection of language delays at a nursery school. Current next steps focus on the design of a model that includes pseudo auto-learning capacity,, supervised by experts.

34677130#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#eHealth interventions are developed to support and facilitate patients with lifestyle changes and self-care tasks after being diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease (CVD). Creating long-lasting effects on lifestyle change and health outcomes with eHealth interventions is challenging and requires good understanding of patient values.
34677130#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of the study was to identify values of importance to patients with CVD to aid in designing a technological lifestyle platform.
34677130#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A mixed method?design was applied,,?combining?data from usability testing?with an additional online survey study,, to validate?the outcomes of the usability tests.
34677130#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 11 relevant patient values were identified,, including the need for security,, support,, not wanting to feel anxious,, tailoring of treatment,, and personalized,, accessible care. The validation survey shows that all values but one (value 9: To have extrinsic motivation to accomplish goals or activities [related to health/lifestyle]) were regarded as important/very important. A rating of very unimportant or unimportant was given by less than 2% of the respondents (value 1: 4/641,, 0.6%; value 2: 10/641,, 1.6%; value 3: 9/641,, 1.4%; value 4: 5/641,, 0.8%; value 5: 10/641,, 1.6%; value 6: 4/641,, 0.6%; value 7: 10/639,, 1.6%; value 8: 4/639,, 0.6%; value 10: 3/636,, 0.5%; value 11: 4/636,, 0.6%) to all values except but one (value 9: 56/636,, 8.8%).
34677130#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#There is a high consensus among patients regarding the identified values reflecting goals and themes central to their lives,, while living with or managing their CVD. The identified values can serve as a foundation for future research to translate and integrate these values into the design of the eHealth technology. This may call for prioritization of values,, as not all values can be met equally.

36567676#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model.
36567676#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model.

36567676#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES#The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as consultancy,, clinical therapies,, real time remote monitoring,, early diagnosis and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT),, edge computing,, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring,, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals,, respiration traces (RESP),, galvanic skin response (GSR),, pulse rate,, body temperature,, photoplethysmograms (PPG),, oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose,, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures,, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices,, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume,, enabling energy efficient transmission.

35113025#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A cross-sectional study was conducted to better understand PFMT and UI among 440 pregnant women. The study reported a UI prevalence of 40.9% (180/440),, with less than half having good PFMT practice despite their good knowledge. Five focus group discussions were conducted to understand the app design preferred by pregnant women. They agreed a more straightforward design should be used for better app usability. From these findings,, a prototype was designed and developed accordingly,, and the process conformed to the user-centered design-11 (UCD-11) checklist. A PFMT app was developed based on the mHealth development and evaluation framework model,, emphasizing higher user involvement in the application design and development. The application was expected to improve its usability,, acceptability,, and ease of use.
35113025#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The Kegel Exercise Pregnancy Training app was validated using a thorough design and development process to ensure its effectiveness in evaluating the usability of the final prototype in our future randomized control trial study.

37223978#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We developed the Smart Healthcare System for Teens At Risk for Depression and Suicide app for Android-based smartphones. This app passively collected data reflecting the social and behavioral activities of adolescents,, such as their smartphone usage time,, physical movement distance,, and the number of phone calls and text messages during the study period. Our study consisted of 24 adolescents (mean age 15.4 [SD 1.4] years,, 17 girls) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed with Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version and 10 healthy controls (mean age 13.8 [SD 0.6] years,, 5 girls). After 1 week's baseline data collection,, adolescents with MDD were treated with escitalopram in an 8-week,, open-label trial. Participants were monitored for 5 weeks,, including the baseline data collection period. Their psychiatric status was measured every week. Depression severity was measured using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale was administered in order to assess suicide severity. We applied the deep learning approach for the analysis of the data. Deep neural network was employed for diagnosis classification,, and neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions was used for feature selection.
37223978#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We could predict the diagnosis of depression with training accuracy of 96.3% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 77%. Of the 24 adolescents with MDD,, 10 responded to antidepressant treatments. We predicted the treatment response of adolescents with MDD with training accuracy of 94.2% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 76%. Adolescents with MDD tended to move longer distances and use smartphones for longer periods of time compared to controls. The deep learning analysis showed that smartphone usage time was the most important feature in distinguishing adolescents with MDD from controls. Prominent differences were not observed in the pattern of each feature between the treatment responders and nonresponders.

37421953#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Timely and accurate intraoperative cryosection evaluations remain the gold standard for guiding surgical treatments for gliomas. However,, the tissue-freezing process often generates artifacts that make histologic interpretation difficult. In addition,, the 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System incorporates molecular profiles in the diagnostic categories,, so standard visual evaluation of cryosections alone cannot completely inform diagnoses based on the new classification system.

37421953#ABSTRACT#METHODS#To address these challenges,, we develop the context-aware Cryosection Histopathology Assessment and Review Machine (CHARM) using samples from 1,,524 glioma patients from three different patient populations to systematically analyze cryosection slides.
37421953#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#Our CHARM models successfully identified malignant cells (AUROC = 0.98 ± 0.01 in the independent validation cohort),, distinguished isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors from wild type (AUROC = 0.79-0.82),, classified three major types of molecularly defined gliomas (AUROC = 0.88-0.93),, and identified the most prevalent subtypes of IDH-mutant tumors (AUROC = 0.89-0.97). CHARM further predicts clinically important genetic alterations in low-grade glioma,, including ATRX,, TP53,, and CIC mutations,, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion,, and 1p/19q codeletion via cryosection images.
37421953#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our approaches accommodate the evolving diagnostic criteria informed by molecular studies,, provide real-time clinical decision support,, and will democratize accurate cryosection diagnoses.

36857123#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Information on PPD was extracted from a random sample of 400 eligible Kaiser Permanente Southern California patients' EHRs. Clinical diagnosis codes and pharmacy records were abstracted for two time periods: January 1,, 2012,, through December 31,, 2014 (International Classification of Diseases,, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] period),, and January 1,, 2017,, through December 31,, 2019 (ICD-10 period). Manual chart reviews of clinical records for PPD were considered the gold standard and were compared with corresponding electronically coded diagnosis and pharmacy records using sensitivity,, specificity,, positive predictive value (PPV),, and negative predictive value (NPV). Kappa statistic was calculated to measure agreement.
36857123#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Overall agreement between the identification of depression using combined diagnosis codes and pharmacy records with that of medical record review was strong (?=0.85,, sensitivity 98.3%,, specificity 83.3%,, PPV 93.7%,, NPV 95.0%). Using only diagnosis codes resulted in much lower sensitivity (65.4%) and NPV (50.5%) but good specificity (88.6%) and PPV (93.5%). Separately,, examining agreement between chart review and electronic coding among diagnosis codes and pharmacy records showed sensitivity,, specificity,, and NPV higher with prescription use records than with clinical diagnosis coding for PPD,, 96.5% versus 72.0%,, 96.5% versus 65.0%,, and 96.5% versus 65.0%,, respectively. There was no notable difference in agreement between ICD-9 (overall ?=0.86) and ICD-10 (overall ?=0.83) coding periods.
36857123#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#PPD is not reliably captured in the clinical diagnosis coding of EHRs. The accuracy of PPD identification can be improved by supplementing clinical diagnosis with pharmacy use records. The completeness of PPD data remained unchanged after the implementation of the ICD-10 diagnosis coding.

36757759#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mental health apps offer a transformative means to increase access to scalable evidence-based care for college students. Yet low rates of engagement currently preclude the effectiveness of these apps. One promising solution is to make these apps more responsive and personalized through digital phenotyping methods able to predict symptoms and offer tailored interventions.
36757759#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Following our protocol and using the exact model shared in that paper,, our primary aim in this study is to assess the prospective validity of mental health symptom prediction using the mindLAMP app through a replication study. We also explored secondary aims around app intervention personalization and correlations of engagement with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scale in the context of automating the study.
36757759#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The study was 28 days in duration and followed the published protocol,, with participants collecting digital phenotyping data and being offered optional scheduled and algorithm-recommended app interventions. Study compensation was tied to the completion of weekly surveys and was not otherwise tied to engagement or use of the app.

36757759#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The data from 67 participants were used in this analysis. The area under the curve values for the symptom prediction model ranged from 0.58 for the UCLA Loneliness Scale to 0.71 for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Engagement with the scheduled app interventions was high,, with a study mean of 73%,, but few participants engaged with the optional recommended interventions. The perceived utility of the app in the TAM was higher (P=.01) among those completing at least one recommended intervention.
36757759#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our results suggest how digital phenotyping methods can be used to create generalizable models that may help create more personalized and engaging mental health apps. Automating studies is feasible,, and our results suggest targets to increase engagement in future studies.

35185732#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The Brislin's translation model was used in this study. The cross-cultural adaptation was performed according to experts' comments and the results of prediction test. The convenience sampling method was utilized to investigate 346 patients who used the "Good Doctor" ("Good Doctor" is the most popular mHealth app in China),, and the reliability and validity of the questionnaire were evaluated as well.
35185732#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#After translation and cross-cultural adaptation,, there were a total of 21 items and 3 dimensions: usability and satisfaction (8 items),, system information arrangement (6 items),, and efficiency (7 items). The content validity index was determined to be 0.952,, indicating that the 21 items used to evaluate the usability of the Chinese version of the MAUQ were well correlated. The Cronbach's a coefficient of the total questionnaire was 0.912,, which revealed that the questionnaire had a high internal consistency. The values of test-retest reliability and split-half reliability of the Chinese version of the MAUQ were 0.869 and 0.701,, respectively,, representing that the questionnaire had a good stability.
35185732#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#The translated questionnaire has good reliability and validity in the context of Chinese culture,, and it could be used as a usability testing tool for the patient version of interactive mHealth apps.
30694197#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Research studies are establishing the use of smartphone sensing to measure mental well-being. Smartphone sensor information captures behavioral patterns,, and its analysis helps reveal well-being changes. Depression in diabetes goes highly underdiagnosed and underreported. The comorbidity has been associated with increased mortality and worse clinical outcomes,, including poor glycemic control and self-management. Clinical-only intervention has been found to have a very modest effect on diabetes management among people with depression. Smartphone technologies could play a significant role in complementing comorbid care.
30694197#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to analyze the association between smartphone-sensing parameters and symptoms of depression and to explore an approach to risk-stratify people with diabetes.
29609596#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Despite the increasing uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT) within healthcare services across developing countries,, community healthcare workers (CHWs) have limited knowledge to fully utilise computerised clinical systems and mobile apps. The 'Introduction to Information and Communication Technology and eHealth' course was developed with the aim to provide CHWs in Malawi,, Africa,, with basic knowledge and computer skills to use digital solutions in healthcare delivery. The course was delivered using a traditional and a blended learning approach.
31758792#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Behavioral therapies,, such as electronic counseling and self-monitoring dispensed through mobile apps,, have been shown to improve blood pressure,, but the results vary and long-term engagement is a challenge. Machine learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that can be used to generate predictive and responsive models for the management and treatment of chronic conditions and shows potential for meaningfully improving outcomes.

30694197#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cross-sectional observational study (Project SHADO-Analyzing Social and Health Attributes through Daily Digital Observation) was conducted on 47 participants with diabetes. The study's smartphone-sensing app passively collected data regarding activity,, mobility,, sleep,, and communication from each participant. Self-reported symptoms of depression using a validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were collected once every 2 weeks from all participants. A descriptive analysis was performed to understand the representation of the participants. A univariate analysis was performed on each derived sensing variable to compare behavioral changes between depression states-those with self-reported major depression (PHQ-9>9) and those with none (PHQ-9=9). A classification predictive modeling,, using supervised machine-learning methods,, was explored using derived sensing variables as input to construct and compare classifiers that could risk-stratify people with diabetes based on symptoms of depression.
30694197#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A noticeably high prevalence of self-reported depression (30 out of 47 participants,, 63%) was found among the participants. Between depression states,, a significant difference was found for average activity rates (daytime) between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 16.06 [SD 14.90]) and those with none (mean 18.79 [SD 16.72]),, P=.005. For average number of people called (calls made and received),, a significant difference was found between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 5.08 [SD 3.83]) and those with none (mean 8.59 [SD 7.05]),, P<.001. These results suggest that participants with diabetes and symptoms of major depression exhibited lower activity through the day and maintained contact with fewer people. Using all the derived sensing variables,, the extreme gradient boosting machine-learning classifier provided the best performance with an average cross-validation accuracy of 79.07% (95% CI 74%-84%) and test accuracy of 81.05% to classify symptoms of depression.
30694197#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Participants with diabetes and self-reported symptoms of major depression were observed to show lower levels of social contact and lower activity levels during the day. Although findings must be reproduced in a broader randomized controlled study,, this study shows promise in the use of predictive modeling for early detection of symptoms of depression in people with diabetes using smartphone-sensing information.

31115768#ABSTRACT##In medical systems for patient's authentication,, keeping biometric data secure is a general problem. Many studies have presented various ways of protecting biometric data especially finger vein biometric data. Thus,, It is needs to find better ways of securing this data by applying the three principles of information security aforementioned,, and creating a robust verification system with high levels of reliability,, privacy and security. Moreover,, it is very difficult to replace biometric information and any leakage of biometrics information leads to earnest risks for example replay attacks using the robbed biometric data. In this paper presented criticism and analysis to all attempts as revealed in the literature review and discussion the proposes a novel verification secure framework based confidentiality,, integrity and availability (CIA) standard in triplex blockchain-particle swarm optimization (PSO)-advanced encryption standard (AES) techniques for medical systems patient's authentication. Three stages are performed on discussion. Firstly,, proposes a new hybrid model pattern in order to increase the randomization based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and finger vein biometrics. To achieve this,, proposed a new merge algorithm to combine the RFID features and finger vein features in one hybrid and random pattern. Secondly,, how the propose verification secure framework are followed the CIA standard for telemedicine authentication by combination of AES encryption technique,, blockchain and PSO in steganography technique based on proposed pattern model. Finally,, discussed the validation and evaluation of the proposed verification secure framework.

29609596#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two questionnaires were developed and tested for face validity and reliability in a pilot course with 20 CHWs. Those were designed to measure CHWs' knowledge of and attitudes towards the use of ICT,, before and after each course,, as well as their satisfaction with each learning approach. Following validation,, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the two learning approaches. A total of 40 CHWs were recruited,, stratified by position,, gender and computer experience,, and allocated to the traditional or blended learning group using block randomisation. Participants completed the baseline and follow-up questionnaires before and after each course to assess the impact of each learning approach on their knowledge,, attitudes,, and satisfaction. Per-item,, pre-post and between-group,, mean differences for each approach were calculated using paired and unpaired t-tests,, respectively. Per-item,, between-group,, satisfaction scores were compared using unpaired t-tests.
29609596#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Scores across all scales improved after attending the traditional and blended learning courses. Self-rated ICT knowledge was significantly improved in both groups with significant differences between groups in seven domains. However,, actual ICT knowledge scores were similar across groups. There were no significant differences between groups in attitudinal gains. Satisfaction with the course was generally high in both groups. However,, participants in the blended learning group found it more difficult to follow the content of the course.
29609596#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study shows that there is no difference between blended and traditional learning in the acquisition of actual ICT knowledge among community healthcare workers in developing countries. Given the human resource constraints in remote resource-poor areas,, the blended learning approach may present an advantageous alternative to traditional learning.

Participants reported blood pressure values at will,, and changes were calculated using averages of baseline and final values for each participant. Machine learning was used to generate a model of participants who would complete the intervention. Random forest models were trained at days 1,, 3,, and 7 of the intervention,, and the generalizability of the models was assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation.
31758792#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The primary cohort comprised 172 participants with hypertension,, having paired blood pressure values,, who were engaged with the intervention. Of the total,, 86.1% participants were women,, the mean age was 55.0 years (95% CI 53.7-56.2),, baseline systolic blood pressure was 138.9 mmHg (95% CI 136.6-141.3),, and diastolic was 86.2 mmHg (95% CI 84.8-87.7). Mean change was -11.5 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -5.9 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure over a mean of 62.6 days (P<.001). Among participants with stage 2 hypertension,, mean change was -17.6 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -8.8 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Changes in blood pressure remained significant in a mixed-effects model accounting for the baseline systolic blood pressure,, age,, gender,, and body mass index (P<.001). A total of 43% of the participants tracking their blood pressure at 12 weeks achieved the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition of blood pressure control. The 7-day predictive model for intervention completion was trained on 427 participants,, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .78.
31758792#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Reductions in blood pressure were observed in adults with hypertension who used the digital therapeutic. The degree of blood pressure reduction was clinically meaningful and achieved rapidly by a majority of the studied participants. Greater improvement was observed in participants with more severe hypertension at baseline. A successful proof of concept for using machine learning to predict intervention completion was presented.

31538396#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE#Assessing patients' disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) requires time-consuming batteries of hospital tests. MSCopilot is a software medical device for the self-assessment of patients with MS (PwMS),, combining four tests: walking,, dexterity,, cognition and low contrast vision. The objective was to validate MSCopilot versus the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).
31538396#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This multicentre,, open-label,, randomized,, controlled,, crossover study enrolled 141 PwMS and 76 healthy controls (HCs). All participants performed MSCopilot and MSFC tests at day 0. To assess reproducibility,, 46 PwMS performed the same tests at day 30 ± 3. The primary end-point was the validation of MSCopilot versus MSFC for the identification of PwMS against HCs,, quantified using the area under the curve (AUC). The main secondary end-point was the correlation of MSCopilot z-scores with MSFC z-scores.
31538396#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In all,, 116 PwMS and 69 HCs were analysed. The primary end-point was achieved: MSCopilot performance was non-inferior to that of MSFC (AUC 0.92 and 0.89 respectively; P = 0.3). MSCopilot and MSFC discriminated PwMS and HCs with 81% and 76% sensitivity and 82% and 88% specificity respectively. Digital and standard test scores were highly correlated (r = 0.81; P < 0.001). The test-retest study demonstrated the good reproducibility of MSCopilot.
31538396#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study confirms the reliability of MSCopilot and its usability in clinical practice for the monitoring of MS-related disability.

30994459#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Patients with chronic diseases are in need of regular health controls. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is currently the most prevalent chronic metabolic disease. A majority of diabetic patients have at least one comorbid chronic disease,, where hypertension is the most common. The standard for blood pressure (BP) measurement is manual BP monitoring at health care clinics. Nevertheless,, several advantages of self-measured BP have been documented. With BP data transfer from an automatic BP monitor via Bluetooth to software,, for example,, a smartphone app,, home measurement could effectively be integrated into regular care.
30994459#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to validate two commercially available automatic BP monitors with the ability to transfer BP data via Bluetooth (Beurer BM 85 and Andersson Lifesense BDR 2.0),, against manual BP monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes.
30994459#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 181 participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited from 6 primary care centers in Stockholm,, Sweden. BP was first measured using a manual BP monitor and then measured using the two automatic BP monitors. The mean differences between the automatic and manual measurements were calculated by subtracting the manual BP monitor measurement from the automatic monitor measurement. Validity of the two automatic BP monitors was further assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficients and the Bland-Altman method.
30994459#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#. The mean difference between the Beurer BM 85 and the manual BP monitor was 11.1 (SD 11.2) mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 8.0 (SD 8.1) mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The mean difference between the Andersson Lifesense BDR 2.0 and the manual BP monitor was 3.2 (SD 10.8) mmHg for SBP and 4.2 (SD 7.2) mmHg for DBP. The automatic BP measurements were significantly correlated (P<.001) with the manual BP measurement values (Andersson Lifesense BDR 2.0: r=0.78 for SBP and r=0.71 for DBP; Beurer BM 85: r=0.78 for SBP and r=0.69 for DBP).
30994459#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The two automatic BP monitors validated measure sufficiently accurate on a group level,, with the Andersson Lifesense BDR 2.0 more often falling within the ranges for what is acceptable in clinical practice compared with the Beurer BM 85.

34255713#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of predicting depression with human behaviors quantified from smartphone data sets,, and to identify behaviors that can influence depression.
34255713#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Smartphone data sets and self-reported 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression assessments were collected from 629 participants in an exploratory longitudinal study over an average of 22.1 days (SD 17.90; range 8-86). We quantified 22 regularity,, entropy,, and SD behavioral markers from the smartphone data. We explored the relationship between the behavioral features and depression using correlation and bivariate linear mixed models (LMMs). We leveraged 5 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms with hyperparameter optimization,, nested cross-validation,, and imbalanced data handling to predict depression. Finally,, with the permutation importance method,, we identified influential behavioral markers in predicting depression.
34255713#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 629 participants from at least 56 countries,, 69 (10.97%) were females,, 546 (86.8%) were males,, and 14 (2.2%) were nonbinary. Participants' age distribution is as follows: 73/629 (11.6%) were aged between 18 and 24,, 204/629 (32.4%) were aged between 25 and 34,, 156/629 (24.8%) were aged between 35 and 44,, 166/629 (26.4%) were aged between 45 and 64,, and 30/629 (4.8%) were aged 65 years and over. Of the 1374 PHQ-8 assessments,, 1143 (83.19%) responses were nondepressed scores (PHQ-8 score <10),, while 231 (16.81%) were depressed scores (PHQ-8 score =10),, as identified based on PHQ-8 cut-off. A significant positive Pearson correlation was found between screen status-normalized entropy and depression (r=0.14,, P<.001). LMM demonstrates an intraclass correlation of 0.7584 and a significant positive association between screen status-normalized entropy and depression (ß=.48,, P=.03). The best ML algorithms achieved the following metrics: precision,, 85.55%-92.51%; recall,, 92.19%-95.56%; F1,, 88.73%-94.00%; area under the curve receiver operating characteristic,, 94.69%-99.06%; Cohen ?,, 86.61%-92.90%; and accuracy,, 96.44%-98.14%. Including age group and gender as predictors improved the ML performances. Screen and internet connectivity features were the most influential in predicting depression.
34255713#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our findings demonstrate that behavioral markers indicative of depression can be unobtrusively identified from smartphone sensors' data. Traditional assessment of depression can be augmented with behavioral markers from smartphones for depression diagnosis and monitoring.

33927586#ABSTRACT#INTRODUCTION#Mobile instant messaging could deliver real-time,, personalized,, interactive smoking cessation support. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is effective in increasing quit attempts and abstinence but is underused. We assessed the feasibility of mobile chat-based intervention combined NRT sampling (NRT-S) on abstinence.
33927586#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this two-arm,, single-blinded,, randomized controlled trial,, adult (=18 years) daily cigarette smokers were proactively recruited from Hong Kong community settings using 'foot-in-the-door' approach during December 2017 to March 2018. All participants received brief advice on quitting,, 1-week of NRT-S,, active referral to smoking cessation services,, and were individually randomized (1:1) at baseline. The intervention group received two months of chat-based support via instant messaging. The control group received general smoking cessation text messages. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (<4 ppm) and salivary cotinine (<10 ng/mL) at 3 and 6 months using intention-to-treat analysis.
33927586#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 119 participants (80.7% male,, 60.5% aged 30-40 years) were randomized and analyzed. Among the 14 and 13 self-reported quitters at 3 and 6 months respectively,, only 3 and 1 had biochemical validation. The 3 months validated abstinence rate was 2/62 (intervention) vs 1/57 (control) (AOR=1.07; 95% CI: 0.08-13.65). At 6 months follow-up (68.9% of participants retained),, more participants in the intervention group reported quitting (10/62 vs 3/57; AOR=2.83; 95% CI: 0.70-11.30),, smoking reduction (20/62 vs 11/57; AOR=1.74; 95% CI: 0.71-4.26),, and quit attempts (56/62 vs 44/57; AOR=2.61; 95% CI: 0.88-7.82). Significantly more NRT-S use (39/62 vs 22/57; AOR=2.27; 95% CI: 1.04-4.96) was observed in the intervention group. Participants engaged in mobile chat support (21/62) reported more NRT-S use (76.2% vs 56.1%),, although not statistically significant.
33927586#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Mobile chat-based support plus NRT-S was feasible and showed preliminary evidence of increased quitting,, smoking reduction,, quit attempts,, and NRT-S use in proactively recruited community smokers.

29525490#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Mobile technology offers the prospect of delivering high-value care with increased patient access and reduced costs. Advances in mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine have been inhibited by the lack of interconnectivity between devices and software and inability to process consumer sensor data. The objective of this study was to preliminarily validate a motion-based machine learning software development kit (SDK) for the shoulder compared with a goniometer for 4 arcs of motion: (1) abduction,, (2) forward flexion,, (3) internal rotation,, and (4) external rotation.
29525490#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A mobile application for the SDK was developed and "taught" 4 arcs of shoulder motion. Ten subjects without shoulder pain or prior shoulder surgery performed the arcs of motion for 5 repetitions. Each motion was measured by the SDK and compared with a physician-measured manual goniometer measurement. Angular differences between SDK and goniometer measurements were compared with univariate and power analyses.
29525490#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The comparison between the SDK and goniometer measurement detected a mean difference of less than 5° for all arcs of motion (P?>?.05),, with a 94% chance of detecting a large effect size from a priori power analysis. Mean differences for the arcs of motion were: abduction,, -3.7°?±?3.2°; forward flexion,, -4.9°?±?2.5°; internal rotation,, -2.4°?± 3.7°; and external rotation -2.6°?±?3.4°.
29525490#ABSTRACT#DISCUSSION#The SDK has the potential to remotely substitute for a shoulder range of motion examination within 5° of goniometer measurements. An open-source motion-based SDK that can learn complex movements,, including clinical shoulder range of motion,, from consumer sensors offers promise for the future of mHealth,, particularly in telemonitoring before and after orthopedic surgery.

32936086#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological diseases. At present,, because the exact cause is still unclear,, accurate diagnosis and progression monitoring remain challenging. In recent years,, exploring the relationship between PD and speech impairment has attracted widespread attention in the academic world. Most of the studies successfully validated the effectiveness of some vocal features. Moreover,, the noninvasive nature of speech signal-based testing has pioneered a new way for telediagnosis and telemonitoring. In particular,, there is an increasing demand for artificial intelligence-powered tools in the digital health era.

34960379#ABSTRACT##The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events-bout segmentation,, initial contact (IC),, and final contact (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5),, shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation,, such as step time,, length,, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors,, MAE ranges were 28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs,, respectively. For the FC-event detection,, MAE ranges were 29.06-48.42,, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar,, wrist and shin sensors,, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients,, ICC(2,,k),, between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC = 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors,, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements,, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters,, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors,, digital health,, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.

32936086#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to build a real-time speech signal analysis tool for PD diagnosis and severity assessment. Further,, the underlying system should be flexible enough to integrate any machine learning or deep learning algorithm.
32936086#ABSTRACT#METHODS#At its core,, the system we built consists of two parts: (1) speech signal processing: both traditional and novel speech signal processing technologies have been employed for feature engineering,, which can automatically extract a few linear and nonlinear dysphonia features,, and (2) application of machine learning algorithms: some classical regression and classification algorithms from the machine learning field have been tested; we then chose the most efficient algorithms and relevant features.
32936086#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Experimental results showed that our system had an outstanding ability to both diagnose and assess severity of PD. By using both linear and nonlinear dysphonia features,, the accuracy reached 88.74% and recall reached 97.03% in the diagnosis task. Meanwhile,, mean absolute error was 3.7699 in the assessment task. The system has already been deployed within a mobile app called No Pa.
32936086#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study performed diagnosis and severity assessment of PD from the perspective of speech order detection. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms indirectly validated the practicality of the system. In particular,, the system reflects the necessity of a publicly accessible PD diagnosis and assessment system that can perform telediagnosis and telemonitoring of PD. This system can also optimize doctors' decision-making processes regarding treatments.

35778727#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) comprises pathological forms of placental trophoblastic tissue proliferation. When benign,, they present with hydatidiform moles,, and when malignant,, they are called Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia. With the growth of the practice of digital health,, allied to updated therapeutic approaches,, the Outpatient Clinic for Gestational Trophoblastic Disease has built a Health Information System (HIS),, contributing to the teaching-learning binomial,, as well as to self-care.
34363220#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To review evidence regarding the use of Health Information Technology (health IT) interventions aimed at improving care for people living with multiple chronic conditions (PLWMCC) in order to identify critical knowledge gaps.
34363220#ABSTRACT#STUDY DESIGN#We identified studies of health IT interventions for PLWMCC across three domains as follows: self-management support,, care coordination,, and algorithms to support clinical decision making.

35778727#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This is a cross-sectional and blind technological assessment research for developing SIS-Mola (Website for the medical team and the Application "MolaApp" aimed at patients with GTD). We used the Praxis management approach to manage the application creation project. In the tasks involving real-time chat,, a WebSocket layer was created and hosted together with the project's web services,, which use the Arch Linux operating system. For the evaluations,, we provided questionnaires developed based on the System Usability Scale (SUS),, to determine the degree of user satisfaction,, with objective questions on the Likert scale. We invited 28 participants for the evaluations,, among ABDTG specialist physicians,, doctors from the DTG Outpatient Clinic team,, and the patients. The study was systematized according to the rules of treatment and follow-up in treating the disease.
35778727#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The tests were conducted from November 2021 to February 2022. The responses obtained on a Likert scale indicated reliability and credibility to the HIS,, since the total usability score,, measured by the ten questions of the SUS instrument,, had a mean of 81.1 (clinicians),, 80 (patients) and median of 77.5 for both groups. The sample was characterized according to the variables: age,, gender,, education,, computer knowledge,, and profession.
35778727#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Developing a HIS in the GTD Outpatient Clinic met the objectives regarding the rules of treatment and follow-up of patients. With these digital tools,, it is possible to obtain data about the patient's health,, sending information through exams performed and appropriate treatments. The connectivity capacity allows agile care,, saving time,, costs and solving the displacement problem. The TICs generate natural efficiency for the organization in the flow of service and the formation of a database,, improving the quality of the assistance.

34363220#ABSTRACT#DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS#Structured search queries were created and validated. Abstracts were reviewed iteratively to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was supplemented by manually searching the bibliographic sections of the included studies. The search included a forward citation search of studies nested within a clinical trial to identify the clinical trial protocol and published clinical trial results. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers.
34363220#ABSTRACT#PRINCIPAL FINDINGS#The search yielded 1907 articles; 44 were included. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 35 other studies including quasi-experimental,, usability,, feasibility,, qualitative studies,, or development/validation studies of analytic models were included. Five RCTs had positive results,, and the remaining four RCTs showed that the interventions had no effect. The studies address individual patient engagement and assess patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life. Few RCTs assess outcomes such as disability and none assess mortality.
34363220#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite a growing body of literature on health IT interventions or multicomponent interventions including a health IT component for chronic disease management,, current evidence for applying health IT solutions to improve care for PLWMCC is limited. The body of literature included in this review provides critical information on the state of the science as well as the many gaps that need to be filled for digital health to fulfill its promise in supporting care delivery that meets the needs of PLWMCC.

31313972#ABSTRACT##Historically,, the term "artificial intelligence" dates to 1956 when it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then,, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain,, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed,, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced,, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation,, clinical and personal utility,, application context,, and is equitable as well. In this context,, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data,, computing power and storage capacities,, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications,, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries,, even economically developed states,, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review,, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death,, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal,, plant,, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health,, diagnosis of diseases in newborns,, remote monitoring of health by smart devices,, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks,, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI,, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather,, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether,, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures,, work force,, and society at large.

36351547#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We collected around 3 million tweets from 1.4 million users between February 1,, 2021,, to January 31,, 2022,, using COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine reactions keyword lists. We performed topic modeling on a sample of the data and applied a modified F1 scoring technique to identify a topic that best differentiated vaccine-related personal health mentions. We then manually annotated 4,,000 of the records from this topic,, which were used to train a transformer-based classifier to identify likely personally experienced vaccine reactions. Applying the trained classifier to the entire data set allowed us to select records we could use to quantify potential vaccine side effects. Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) referred to in these records were compared with those reported to the state of Victoria's spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system,, SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community).
36351547#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The most frequently mentioned potential vaccine reactions generally aligned with SAEFVIC data. Notable exceptions were increased Twitter reporting of bleeding-related AEFI and allergic reactions,, and more frequent SAEFVIC reporting of cardiac AEFI.
36351547#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Social media conversations are a potentially valuable supplementary data source for detecting vaccine adverse event mentions. Monitoring of online observations about new vaccine-related personal health experiences has the capacity to provide early warnings about emerging vaccine safety issues.

33879844#ABSTRACT##Excess alcohol use is an important determinant of death and disability. Machine learning (ML)-driven interventions leveraging smart-breathalyzer data may help reduce these harms. We developed a digital phenotype of long-term smart-breathalyzer behavior to predict individuals' breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels trained on data from a smart breathalyzer. We analyzed roughly one million datapoints from 33,,452 users of a commercial smart-breathalyzer device,, collected between 2013 and 2017. For validation,, we analyzed the associations between state-level observed smart-breathalyzer BrAC levels and impaired-driving motor vehicle death rates. Behavioral,, geolocation-based,, and time-series-derived features were fed to an ML algorithm using training (70% of the cohort),, development (10% of the cohort),, and test (20% of the cohort) sets to predict the likelihood of a BrAC exceeding the legal driving limit (0.08?g/dL). States with higher average BrAC levels had significantly higher alcohol-related driving death rates,, adjusted for the number of users per state B (SE)?=?91.38 (15.16),, p?<?0.01. In the independent test set,, the ML algorithm predicted the likelihood of a given user-initiated BrAC sample exceeding BrAC?=?0.08?g/dL,, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 85%. Highly predictive features included users' prior BrAC trends,, subjective estimation of their BrAC (or AUC?=?82% without the self-estimate),, engagement and self-monitoring,, time since the last measure,, and hour of the day. In conclusion,, an ML algorithm successfully quantified a digital phenotype of behavior,, predicting naturalistic BrAC levels exceeding 0.08?g/dL (a threshold associated with alcohol-related harm) with good discrimination capability. This result establishes a foundation for future research on precision behavioral medicine digital health interventions using smart breathalyzers and passive monitoring approaches.

28536089#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The emergence of smartphones and tablets featuring vastly advancing functionalities (eg,, sensors,, computing power,, interactivity) has transformed the way mHealth interventions support chronic disease management for older adults. Baby boomers have begun to widely adopt smart devices and have expressed their desire to incorporate technologies into their chronic care. Although smart devices are actively used in research,, little is known about the extent,, characteristics,, and range of smart device-based interventions.
28536089#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We conducted a scoping review to (1) understand the nature,, extent,, and range of smart device-based research activities,, (2) identify the limitations of the current research and knowledge gap,, and (3) recommend future research directions.
28536089#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. We identified relevant studies from MEDLINE,, Embase,, CINAHL,, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to mobile health,, chronic disease,, and older adults. Selected studies used smart devices,, sampled older adults,, and were published in 2010 or after. The exclusion criteria were sole reliance on text messaging (short message service,, SMS) or interactive voice response,, validation of an electronic version of a questionnaire,, postoperative monitoring,, and evaluation of usability. We reviewed references. We charted quantitative data and analyzed qualitative studies using thematic synthesis. To collate and summarize the data,, we used the chronic care model.
28536089#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 51 articles met the eligibility criteria. Research activity increased steeply in 2014 (17/51,, 33%) and preexperimental design predominated (16/50,, 32%). Diabetes (16/46,, 35%) and heart failure management (9/46,, 20%) were most frequently studied. We identified diversity and heterogeneity in the collection of biometrics and patient-reported outcome measures within and between chronic diseases. Across studies,, we found 8 self-management supporting strategies and 4 distinct communication channels for supporting the decision-making process. In particular,, self-monitoring (38/40,, 95%),, automated feedback (15/40,, 38%),, and patient education (13/40,, 38%) were commonly used as self-management support strategies. Of the 23 studies that implemented decision support strategies,, clinical decision making was delegated to patients in 10 studies (43%). The impact on patient outcomes was consistent with studies that used cellular phones. Patients with heart failure and asthma reported improved quality of life. Qualitative analysis yielded 2 themes of facilitating technology adoption for older adults and 3 themes of barriers.
28536089#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Limitations of current research included a lack of gerontological focus,, dominance of preexperimental design,, narrow research scope,, inadequate support for participants,, and insufficient evidence for clinical outcome. Recommendations for future research include generating evidence for smart device-based programs,, using patient-generated data for advanced data mining techniques,, validating patient decision support systems,, and expanding mHealth practice through innovative technologies.

31312805#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Ebola virus disease (EVD) plagues low-resource and difficult-to-access settings. Machine learning prognostic models and mHealth tools could improve the understanding and use of evidence-based care guidelines in such settings. However,, data incompleteness and lack of interoperability limit model generalizability. This study harmonizes diverse datasets from the 2014-16 EVD epidemic and generates several prognostic models incorporated into the novel Ebola Care Guidelines app that provides informed access to recommended evidence-based guidelines.
31312805#KEYWORD##Clinical intuition
31312805#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate survival outcomes in 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Sierra Leone at various timepoints during 2014-16. We generated a parsimonious model (viral load,, age,, temperature,, bleeding,, jaundice,, dyspnea,, dysphagia,, and time-to-presentation) and several fallback models for when these variables are unavailable. All were externally validated against two independent datasets and compared to further models including expert observational wellness assessments. Models were incorporated into an app highlighting the signs/symptoms with the largest contribution to prognosis.
31312805#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#The parsimonious model approached the predictive power of observational assessments by experienced clinicians (Area-Under-the-Curve,, AUC?=?0.70-0.79,, accuracy?=?0.64-0.74) and maintained its performance across subcohorts with different healthcare seeking behaviors. Age and viral load contributed > 5-fold the weighting of other features and including them in a minimal model had a similar AUC,, albeit at the cost of specificity.
31312805#ABSTRACT#INTERPRETATION#Clinically guided prognostic models can recapitulate clinical expertise and be useful when such expertise is unavailable. Incorporating these models into mHealth tools may facilitate their interpretation and provide informed access to comprehensive clinical guidelines.

Adults (ages 18-65) who self-identified as having clinically significant depressive symptoms [i.e. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) = 5] utilized the mind.me app-a mobile phone technology that collects data passively and continuously,, and is capable of integrating broad multimodal data [e.g.,, location variance (e.g. GPS),, behavioural (e.g. social network activity),, and communication data (e.g. SMS texting,, phone calls)]. The primary outcome was predictive accuracy (i.e. convergent validity with depressive symptom measurement,, as captured by the PHQ-9). 200 subjects were enrolled in the study (mean age 46 ± 12.71). The average PHQ-9 score was 12.8 ± 6.9. The predictive accuracy of the mind.me app was 0.91 ± 0.06. The sensitivity was 0.98 and the specificity was 0.93. The mind.me app was rated by 200 users as highly usable and informative to their illness. The mind.me app exhibits robust predictive accuracy in detecting depressive symptoms in adults with clinically relevant depressive symptoms. The mind.me app more specifically demonstrates convergence with the PHQ-9.

36047606#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital health interventions are increasingly used to handle and promote positive health behaviors. Clinical measures are often used,, and a certain precision is essential for digital health interventions to have an effect. Only few studies have compared clinically measured weights with self-reported weights. No study has examined the validity of self-reported weight from a mobile app used in a tailored weight loss intervention.
36047606#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Self-reported weight obtained from mobile health is a valid method for collecting anthropometric measurements.

36047606#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The aim of this study was to analyze the agreement between clinically measured weight and self-reported weight collected from a mobile health lifestyle coaching program during a 12-month weight loss intervention for obese patients with and without type 2 diabetes. The secondary aim was to investigate the determinants for possible discrepancies between clinically measured and self-reported weights of these patients with different demographic and lifestyle characteristics and achievements of weight loss goals.
36047606#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Weight registrations were collected from participants (N=104) in a Danish randomized controlled trial examining the effect of a digital lifestyle intervention on weight loss among obese patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Data were collected at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Self-reported weight was measured at home and registered in the app.
36047606#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#,, respectively,, between clinically measured weight and self-reported weight. Weight change during the first 6 months was also associated with a difference of 0.1 kg (95% CI 0.04-0.01; P<.001) per kilogram of difference in weight between clinically measured weight and self-reported weight. Participants who did not achieve the 5% weight loss goal underestimated their weight by 0.79 kg (95% CI 0.34-1.23) at 6 months. After 12 months,, only baseline weight was associated with a discrepancy of 0.03 kg (95% CI 0.01-0.05; P=.02) per increment of kilogram between clinically measured weight and self-reported weight. None of the other factors showed any significant discrepancy after 12 months.

36643095#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Retrospective medical and dental data were retrieved from Marshfield Clinic Health System's data warehouse and integrated electronic medical-dental health records (iEHR). Retrieved data were pre-processed prior to conducting analyses and included matching of cases to controls by (a) race/ethnicity and (b) 1:1 Case: Control ratio. Variables with >30% missing data were excluded from analysis. Datasets were divided into four subsets: (1) All Pneumonia (all cases and controls); (2) community (CAP)/healthcare associated (HCAP) pneumonias; (3) ventilator-associated (VAP)/hospital-acquired (HAP) pneumonias and (4) aspiration pneumonia (AP). Performance of five algorithms were compared across the four subsets: Naïve Bayes,, Logistic Regression,, Support Vector Machine (SVM),, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forests. Feature (input variables) selection and ten-fold cross validation was performed on all the datasets. An evaluation set (10%) was extracted from the subsets for further validation. Model performance was evaluated in terms of total accuracy,, sensitivity,, specificity,, F-measure,, Mathews-correlation-coefficient and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
36643095#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 6,,034 records (cases and controls) met eligibility for inclusion in the main dataset. After feature selection,, the variables retained in the subsets were: All Pneumonia (n = 29 variables),, CAP-HCAP (n = 26 variables); VAP-HAP (n = 40 variables) and AP (n = 37 variables),, respectively. Variables retained (n = 22) were common across all four pneumonia subsets. Of these,, the number of missing teeth,, periodontal status,, periodontal pocket depth more than 5 mm and number of restored teeth contributed to all the subsets and were retained in the model. MLP outperformed other predictive models for All Pneumonia,, CAP-HCAP and AP subsets,, while SVM outperformed other models in VAP-HAP subset.
36643095#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#This study validates previously described associations between poor oral health and pneumonia. Benefits of an integrated medical-dental record and care delivery environment for modeling pneumonia risk are highlighted. Based on findings,, risk score development could inform referrals and follow-up in integrated healthcare delivery environment and coordinated patient management.

36053561#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Two scales,, namely match and elaboration,, were used to measure patients' basic search strategies (ie,, simple approach) and advanced search strategies (ie,, integrative approach),, respectively. In addition,, the consultation scale was used to evaluate the participants' use of online health information to consult doctors and others. A total of 253 outpatients without university education were purposely selected and surveyed. The participants were outpatients at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to analyze the measurement model to specify the measurement validation. In addition,, the structure model of PLS-SEM was evaluated to examine the path correlations between variables and to execute interaction effect and curvilinear relationship analyses.
36053561#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The results of the path correlation analysis by PLS-SEM showed that both elaboration strategy (path coefficient=0.55,, P<.001) and match strategy (path coefficient=0.36,, P<.001) were positively correlated with consultation on online health information with doctors and others. In addition,, interaction effect and curvilinear relationship analyses indicated that there was a significant interaction effect between elaboration and match on consultation (path coefficient=-0.34,, P<.001) and a significant curvilinear relationship between match and consultation (path coefficient=-0.09,, P=.046).
36053561#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Increasing patients' exposure to online health information through both a simple search approach (ie,, match strategy) and a complex search approach (ie,, elaboration strategy) may lead them to appropriately use the information to consult doctors and others. However,, the results of interaction effect and curvilinear relationship analyses highlighted the essential role of the elaboration strategy to properly locate,, evaluate,, and apply online health information. The findings of this study may help health care professionals better understand how to communicate with their patients through the health information on the internet.

34889741#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Obtaining explicit consent from patients to use their remnant biological samples and deidentified clinical data for research is essential for advancing precision medicine.
34889741#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to describe the operational implementation and scalability of an electronic universal consent process that was used to power an institutional precision health biobank across a large academic health system.
34889741#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The University of California,, Los Angeles,, implemented the use of innovative electronic consent videos as the primary recruitment tool for precision health research. The consent videos targeted patients aged =18 years across ambulatory clinical laboratories,, perioperative settings,, and hospital settings. Each of these major areas had slightly different workflows and patient populations. Sociodemographic information,, comorbidity data,, health utilization data (ambulatory visits,, emergency room visits,, and hospital admissions),, and consent decision data were collected.
34889741#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The consenting approach proved scalable across 22 clinical sites (hospital and ambulatory settings). Over 40,,000 participants completed the consent process at a rate of 800 to 1000 patients per week over a 2-year time period. Participants were representative of the adult University of California,, Los Angeles,, Health population. The opt-in rates in the perioperative (16,,500/22,,519,, 73.3%) and ambulatory clinics (2308/3390,, 68.1%) were higher than those in clinical laboratories (7506/14,,235,, 52.7%; P<.001). Patients with higher medical acuity were more likely to opt in. The multivariate analyses showed that African American (odds ratio [OR] 0.53,, 95% CI 0.49-0.58; P<.001),, Asian (OR 0.72,, 95% CI 0.68-0.77; P<.001),, and multiple-race populations (OR 0.73,, 95% CI 0.69-0.77; P<.001) were less likely to participate than White individuals.
34889741#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This is one of the few large-scale,, electronic video-based consent implementation programs that reports a 65.5% (26,,314/40,,144) average overall opt-in rate across a large academic health system. This rate is higher than those previously reported for email (3.6%) and electronic biobank (50%) informed consent rates. This study demonstrates a scalable recruitment approach for population health research.

36170001#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Disparities in HIV outcomes persist among racial,, gender,, and sexual minorities in the United States. Younger people face a greater risk of contracting HIV,, often living without knowledge of their HIV status for long periods. The Positive Peers App (PPA) is a multifunctional HIV support tool designed to improve HIV-related clinical outcomes for young people with HIV. The app was designed according to the specifications of an in-care young adult HIV community in Northeast Ohio. Data provided in this study provide preliminary evidence of the usefulness of PPA as a relevant tool for engaging this clinical patient population in care and facilitating viral suppression.
36170001#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we aimed to describe variations in PPA use and examine the associations between use and HIV clinical outcomes between self-selected user and nonuser cohorts in the same clinical population.
36170001#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The PPA was offered free of charge to persons with HIV,, aged 13 to 34 years of age,, diagnosed with HIV within the last 12 months,, out of care for 6 months during the last 24 months,, or not virally suppressed (HIV viral load >200 copies/mL) in the prior 24 months. Baseline and 6- and 12-month surveys were administered via an audio computer-assisted self-interviewing system to all participants. The app's user activity was tracked natively by the app and stored in a secure server. Participant demographic and HIV care data were extracted from clinical records within 12 months before the start of the study and across the duration of the study period. HIV care outcomes of PPA users (n=114) were compared with those of nonusers (n=145) at the end of the study period (n=259).
36170001#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The analysis showed that younger PPA users (aged 13-24 years) were more likely to obtain HIV laboratories (adjusted odds ratio 2.85,, 95% CI 1.03-7.90) and achieve sustained viral suppression than nonusers (adjusted odds ratio 4.2,, 95% CI 1.2-13.9).
36170001#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The PPA appears to help younger users sustain HIV suppression. The app offers an important tool for addressing this critical population. The PPA remains in the field and is currently being adopted by other localities to facilitate their efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Although our reported observational results require additional validation and stringent ongoing surveillance,, the results represent our best efforts in a pilot study to provide a measure of efficacy for the PPA. Next steps include a large-scale evaluation of the PPA acceptability and effectiveness. Given the building evidence of user reports and outcomes,, the freely available PPA could be a helpful tool for achieving Ending the HIV Epidemic goals.

34383684#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The rapid diffusion of wearable electronic health monitoring devices (wearable devices or wearables) among lay populations shows that self-tracking and self-monitoring are pervasively expanding,, while influencing health-related practices. General practitioners are confronted with this phenomenon,, since they often are the expert-voice that patients will seek.
34383684#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This article aims to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the role of wearable devices in family medicine and of their benefits,, risks,, and challenges associated with their use. It also explores their perceptions of the future development of these devices.
34383684#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data were collected during a medical conference among 19 Swiss general practitioners through mind maps. Maps were first sketched at the conference and their content was later compared with notes and reports written during the conference,, which allowed for further integration of information. This tool represents an innovative methodology in qualitative research that allows for time-efficient data collection and data analysis.
34383684#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Data analysis highlighted that wearable devices were described as user-friendly,, adaptable devices that could enable performance monitoring and support medical research. Benefits included support for patients' empowerment and education,, behavior change facilitation,, better awareness of personal medical history and body functioning,, efficient information transmission,, and connection with the patient's medical network; however,, general practitioners were concerned by a lack of scientific validation,, lack of clarity over data protection,, and the risk of stakeholder-associated financial interests. Other perceived risks included the promotion of an overly medicalized health culture and the risk of supporting patients' self-diagnosis and self-medication. General practitioners also feared increased pressure on their workload and a compromised doctor-patient relationship. Finally,, they raised important questions that can guide wearables' future design and development,, highlighting a need for general practitioners and medical professionals to be involved in the process.

34383684#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Wearables play an increasingly central role in daily health-related practices,, and general practitioners expressed a desire to become more involved in the development of such technologies. Described as useful information providers,, wearables were generally positively perceived and did not seem to pose a threat to the doctor-patient relationship. However,, general practitioners expressed their concern that wearables may fuel a self-monitoring logic,, to the detriment of patients' autonomy and overall well-being. While wearables can contribute to health promotion,, it is crucial to clarify the logic underpinning the design of such devices. Through the analysis of group discussions,, this study contributes to the existing literature by presenting general practitioners' perceptions of wearable devices. This paper provides insight on general practitioners' perception to be considered in the context of product development and marketing.

31746771#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The level and type of engagement with digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) are likely to influence their effectiveness,, but validated self-report measures of engagement are lacking. The DBCI Engagement Scale was designed to assess behavioral (ie,, amount,, depth of use) and experiential (ie,, attention,, interest,, enjoyment) dimensions of engagement.
31746771#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the DBCI Engagement Scale in users of a smartphone app for reducing alcohol consumption.
31746771#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Participants (N=147) were UK-based,, adult,, excessive drinkers recruited via an online research platform. Participants downloaded the Drink Less app and completed the scale immediately after their first login in exchange for a financial reward. Criterion variables included the objectively recorded amount of use,, depth of use,, and subsequent login. Five types of validity (ie,, construct,, criterion,, predictive,, incremental,, divergent) were examined in exploratory factor,, correlational,, and regression analyses. The Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess the scale's internal reliability. Covariates included motivation to reduce alcohol consumption.
31746771#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#=1.19; 95% CI 1.05-1.34; P=.006) but not the behavioral subscale.
31746771#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The DBCI Engagement Scale assesses behavioral and experiential aspects of engagement. The behavioral subscale may not be a valid indicator of behavioral engagement. The experiential subscale can predict subsequent behavioral engagement with an app for reducing alcohol consumption. Further refinements and validation of the scale in larger samples and across different DBCIs are needed.

31559269#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The HIV epidemic in Cambodia is strongly and disproportionately concentrated among key populations. One important hard-to-reach key population is the expanding community of female entertainment workers (FEWs). HIV as well as other sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes including sexually transmitted infections (STIs),, contraception,, and gynecologic health are also substandard among FEWs. To address these concerns,, a mobile health intervention (mHealth) using short message service (SMS) and voice message (VM) services-the Mobile Link project-was constructed. This paper aims to describe the development of this mHealth intervention that used participatory methodologies and to illustrate how these findings can be useful in future mHealth projects.
31559269#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This intervention development process used an iterative,, participatory approach. Twenty-seven focus group discussions (FGDs) covering SRH topics were designed and conducted and implemented across four provinces in Cambodia. Additionally,, six in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with FEWs living with HIV in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Data from the FGDs and IDIs were analyzed using content and matrix analysis methods to identify prioritized themes for messages. Two data validation workshops were organized to present the prioritized themes to FEWs and outreach workers (outreach workers) for validation. The workshops included activities stimulating participation such as listening to sample messages in order to determine health priorities as well as message tone and style.
31559269#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Utilizing participatory methodologies was demonstrated to be useful in intervention content creation and program implementation. As a result of this intervention development process,, the research team gleaned lessons that may be applicable to future mHealth projects including the idea of adding some layers of choice to mHealth interventions for further tailoring at the individual level and the importance of human contact and trusting relationship.

31559269#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The findings from the qualitative research provided guidance on how to tailor the intervention to the FEW community in terms of the tone,, timing,, content and delivery mode of the messages. Participants preferred a friendly,, professional female voice for VM. Participants revealed that health priorities such as gynecologic issues (vaginal infections/irritation) and cervical and breast cancer,, were emphasized more than HIV and family planning. Participants also reported a number of misconceptions about contraception,, particularly around oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices,, and STI transmission. Participants expressed the need to build trust in outreach workers and linkages,, affirming the emphasis on the link within the Mobile Link project. Lastly,, from the IDIs,, FEWs living with HIV highlighted wanting supportive/messages to address depressive feelings that may stem from their perceived stigma.
34061041#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Lifestyle choices and socioeconomic status have a significant impact on the expected onset of diseases,, age of death,, and risk factors concerning long-term illnesses and morbidity. STAR is an online health examination tool,, which gives users a report that includes an evaluation of their life expectancy and an estimated risk for developing common long-term illnesses based on questions about health,, characteristics,, lifestyle,, and quality of life.
34061041#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The goals of this study are to (1) review the capacity of STAR to recognize morbidity risks in comparison to a traditional nurse-led health examination and patient-reported health challenges; (2) evaluate the user experience and usability of STAR; and (3) assess the potential impact of STAR on the health confidence and motivation of patients to make healthier lifestyle choices.
34061041#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This mixed methods validation study will consist of a quantitative part (questionnaires) and a qualitative part (phone interviews and open-ended questions from the questionnaires). The participants will include 100 long-term unemployed individuals attending a health check for the unemployed. The participants will be recruited from three Finnish public health centers in Espoo,, Hämeenlinna,, and Tampere. At the health centers,, the participants will use STAR and attend a nurse's health check. Surveys with multiple-choice and open-ended questions will be collected from the participants,, the nurse,, and a study assistant. The questionnaires include questions about the participant's background and health challenges from the patient and nurse points of view,, as well as questions about how well the health challenges matched the STAR report. The questionnaires also gather data about user experience,, health confidence,, and usability of STAR. A study assistant will fill out an observer's form containing questions about use time and possible problems encountered while using STAR. A sample of the unemployed participants will be interviewed by telephone subsequently. For the quantitative data,, descriptive statistics and a reliability analysis will be performed,, and mean sum scores will be computed for the study variables. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data will be performed.

34061041#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Expert Responsibility Area of Tampere University Hospital in June 2020 (ETL Code R20067). Data collection will begin in June 2021 and will take approximately 3-6 months.
34061041#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Online health examinations can improve the effectiveness of primary prevention in health care by supporting efficient evidence-based morbidity risk estimation and motivating patients to change unhealthy behaviors. A multimethod approach is used to allow for assessment of the tool's usefulness from the points of view of both professionals and patients. This study will further provide a rich understanding of how the tool can be used as part of routine health checks,, and how and why the tool may or may not motivate users for making healthier lifestyle choices.

37083627#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Children with growth hormone deficiency face the prospect of long-term recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) treatment requiring daily injections. Adherence to treatment is important,, especially at treatment initiation,, to achieve positive health outcomes. Historically,, telenursing services embedded in patient support programs (PSPs) have been a valid approach to support r-hGH treatment initiation and patient education and facilitate adherence by identifying and optimizing appropriate injection techniques. The development of mobile phones with augmented reality (AR) capabilities offers nurses new tools to support patient education.
37083627#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#To investigate experiences among nurses of a new mobile phone app developed to support patient training with a phone-based PSP for r-hGH treatment.
37083627#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In 2020,, the Easypod AR mobile app was launched to support nurse-driven telehealth education for patients initiating r-hGH therapy with the Easypod electromechanical auto-injector device. Nurses who were part of PSPs in countries where the Easypod AR app had been launched or where training was provided as part of an anticipated future launch of the app were invited to participate in an online survey based on the Mobile App Rating Scale to capture their feedback after using the app.
37083627#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#In total,, 23 nurses completed the online questionnaire. They positively rated the quality of the app across multiple dimensions. The highest mean scores were 4.0 for engagement (ie,, adaptation to the target group; SD 0.74),, 4.1 (SD 0.79) for functionality (navigation) and 4.1 (SD 0.67) for aesthetics (graphics). Responses indicated the potential positive impact of such a tool on enhancing patient education,, patient support,, and communication between patients and PSP nurses. Some participants also suggested enhancements to the app,, including gamification techniques that they felt have the potential to support the formation of positive treatment behaviors and habits.

37071450#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Legal,, controlled,, and regulated access to high-quality data from academic hospitals currently poses a barrier to the development and testing of new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To overcome this barrier,, the German Federal Ministry of Health supports the "pAItient" (Protected Artificial Intelligence Innovation Environment for Patient Oriented Digital Health Solutions for developing,, testing and evidence-based evaluation of clinical value) project,, with the goal to establish an AI Innovation Environment at the Heidelberg University Hospital,, Germany. It is designed as a proof-of-concept extension to the preexisting Medical Data Integration Center.
37071450#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The first part of the pAItient project aims to explore stakeholders' requirements for developing AI in partnership with an academic hospital and granting AI experts access to anonymized personal health data.
37071450#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We designed a multistep mixed methods approach. First,, researchers and employees from stakeholder organizations were invited to participate in semistructured interviews. In the following step,, questionnaires were developed based on the participants' answers and distributed among the stakeholders' organizations. In addition,, patients and physicians were interviewed.
37071450#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The study led to the identification of necessary requirements for the development,, testing,, and validation of AI applications within a hospital-based generic infrastructure. A requirements model was developed,, which will inform the next steps in the development of an AI innovation environment at our institution. Results from our study replicate previous findings from other contexts and will add to the emerging discussion on the use of routine medical data for the development of AI applications.

37071450#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#The identified requirements covered a wide range and were conflicting sometimes. Relevant patient requirements included adequate provision of necessary information for data use,, clear medical objective of the research and development activities,, trustworthiness of the organization collecting the patient data,, and data should not be reidentifiable. Requirements of AI researchers and developers encompassed contact with clinical users,, an acceptable user interface (UI) for shared data platforms,, stable connection to the planned infrastructure,, relevant use cases,, and assistance in dealing with data privacy regulations. In a next step,, a requirements model was developed,, which depicts the identified requirements in different layers. This developed model will be used to communicate stakeholder requirements within the pAItient project consortium.
37043261#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Micronutrient deficiencies represent a major global health issue,, with over 2 billion individuals experiencing deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. Food labels provide consumers with information regarding the nutritional content of food items and have been identified as a potential tool for improving diets. However,, due to governmental regulations and the physical limitations of the labels,, food labels often lack comprehensive information about the vitamins and minerals present in foods. As a result,, information about most of the micronutrients is absent from existing food labels.
37043261#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper aims to examine the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict unreported micronutrients such as vitamin A (retinol),, vitamin C,, vitamin B1 (thiamin),, vitamin B2 (riboflavin),, vitamin B3 (niacin),, vitamin B6,, vitamin B12,, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol),, vitamin K,, and minerals such as magnesium,, zinc,, phosphorus,, selenium,, manganese,, and copper from nutrition information provided on existing food labels. If unreported micronutrients can be predicted with acceptable accuracies from existing food labels using machine learning predictive models,, such models can be integrated into mobile apps to provide consumers with additional micronutrient information about foods and help them make more informed diet decisions.
37043261#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) data set,, representing a total of 5624 foods,, were used to train a diverse set of machine learning classification and regression algorithms to predict unreported vitamins and minerals from existing food label data. For each model,, hyperparameters were adjusted,, and the models were evaluated using repeated cross-validation to ensure that the reported results were not subject to overfitting.
37043261#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# varying in a wide range from 0.28 (for magnesium) to 0.92 (for manganese),, the classification models can accurately predict the category ("low,," "medium,," or "high") level of all minerals and vitamins with accuracies exceeding 0.80. The highest classification accuracies for specific micronutrients are achieved for vitamin B12 (0.94) and phosphorus (0.94),, while the lowest are for vitamin E (0.81) and selenium (0.83).

The results show that the approach has the potential to significantly improve consumer knowledge about the micronutrient content of the foods they consume. Integrating these predictive models into mobile apps can enhance their accessibility and engagement with consumers. The implications of this research for public health are noteworthy,, underscoring the potential of technology to augment consumers' understanding of the micronutrient content of their diets while also facilitating the tracking of food intake and providing personalized recommendations based on the micronutrient content and individual preferences.
34617905#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Subclinical (ie,, threshold) social anxiety can greatly affect young people's lives,, but existing solutions appear inadequate considering its rising prevalence. Wearable sensors may provide a novel way to detect social anxiety and result in new opportunities for monitoring and treatment,, which would be greatly beneficial for persons with social anxiety,, society,, and health care services. Nevertheless,, indicators such as skin temperature measured by wrist-worn sensors have not been used in prior work on physiological social anxiety detection.
34617905#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aimed to investigate whether subclinical social anxiety in young adults can be detected using physiological data obtained from wearable sensors,, including heart rate,, skin temperature,, and electrodermal activity (EDA).
34617905#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Young adults (N=12) with self-reported subclinical social anxiety (measured using the widely used self-reported version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) participated in an impromptu speech task. Physiological data were collected using an E4 Empatica wearable device. Using the preprocessed data and following a supervised machine learning approach,, various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine,, Decision Tree,, Random Forest,, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were used to develop models for 3 different contexts. Models were trained to differentiate (1) between baseline and socially anxious states,, (2) among baseline,, anticipation anxiety,, and reactive anxiety states,, and (3) social anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity. The predictive capability of the singular modalities was also explored in each of the 3 supervised learning experiments. The generalizability of the developed models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation as a performance index.

34617905#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#With modalities combined,, the developed models yielded accuracies between 97.54% and 99.48% when differentiating between baseline and socially anxious states. Models trained to differentiate among baseline,, anticipation anxiety,, and reactive anxiety states yielded accuracies between 95.18% and 98.10%. Furthermore,, the models developed to differentiate between social anxiety experienced by individuals with anxiety of differing severity scores successfully classified with accuracies between 98.86% and 99.52%. Surprisingly,, EDA was identified as the most effective singular modality when differentiating between baseline and social anxiety states,, whereas ST was the most effective modality when differentiating anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity.
34617905#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The results indicate that it is possible to accurately detect social anxiety as well as distinguish between levels of severity in young adults by leveraging physiological data collected from wearable sensors.

37335603#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Digital peer support enhances engagement in mental and physical health services despite barriers such as location,, transportation,, and other accessibility constraints. Digital peer support involves live or automated peer support services delivered through technology media such as peer-to-peer networks,, smartphone apps,, and asynchronous and synchronous technologies. Supervision standards for digital peer support can determine important administrative,, educative,, and supportive guidelines for supervisors to maintain the practice of competent digital peer support,, develop knowledgeable and skilled digital peer support specialists,, clarify the role and responsibility of digital peer support specialists,, and support specialists in both an emotional and developmental capacity.
37335603#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#Although digital peer support has expanded recently,, there are no formal digital supervision standards. The aim of this study is to inform the development of supervision standards for digital peer support and introduce guidelines that supervisors can use to support,, guide,, and develop competencies in digital peer support specialists.
37335603#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Peer support specialists that currently offer digital peer support services were recruited via an international email listserv of 1500 peer support specialists. Four 1-hour focus groups,, with a total of 59 participants,, took place in October 2020. Researchers used Rapid and Rigorous Qualitative Data Analysis methods. Researchers presented data transcripts to focus group participants for feedback and to determine if the researcher's interpretation of the data match their intended meanings.
37335603#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We identified 51 codes and 11 themes related to the development of supervision standards for digital peer support. Themes included (1) education on technology competency (43/197,, 21.8%),, (2) education on privacy,, security,, and confidentiality in digital devices and platforms (33/197,, 16.8%),, (3) education on peer support competencies and how they relate to digital peer support (25/197,, 12.7%),, (4) administrative guidelines (21/197,, 10.7%),, (5) education on the digital delivery of peer support (18/197,, 9.1%),, (6) education on technology access (17/197,, 8.6%),, (7) supervisor support of work-life balance (17/197,, 8.6%),, (8) emotional support (9/197,, 4.6%),, (9) administrative documentation (6/197,, 3%),, (10) education on suicide and crisis intervention (5/197,, 2.5%),, and (11) feedback (3/197,, 1.5%).

37335603#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Currently,, supervision standards from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for in-person peer support include administrative,, educative,, and supportive functions. However,, digital peer support has necessitated supervision standard subthemes such as education on technology and privacy,, support of work-life balance,, and emotional support. Lack of digital supervision standards may lead to a breach in ethics and confidentiality,, workforce stress,, loss of productivity,, loss of boundaries,, and ineffectively serving users who participate in digital peer support services. Digital peer support specialists require specific knowledge and skills to communicate with service users and deliver peer support effectively,, while supervisors require new knowledge and skills to effectively develop,, support,, and manage the digital peer support role.
33849843#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes,, contributing to obesity. However,, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions.
33849843#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data,, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone.
33849843#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data.
33849843#ABSTRACT#RESULTS# value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender,, engagement,, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism),, rs2016520_C (BMI,, waist circumference,, and cholesterol metabolism),, and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably,, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks.
33849843#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk,, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed,, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk,, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.

34142978#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Currently,, high-speed digital imaging (HSDI),, especially endoscopic HSDI,, is routinely used for the diagnosis of vocal cord disorders. However,, endoscopic HSDI devices are usually large and costly,, which limits access to patients in underdeveloped countries and in regions with inadequate medical infrastructure. Modern smartphones have sufficient functionality to process the complex calculations that are required for processing high-resolution images and videos with a high frame rate. Recently,, several attempts have been made to integrate medical endoscopes with smartphones to make them more accessible to people in underdeveloped countries.
34142978#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to develop a smartphone adaptor for endoscopes,, which enables smartphone-based vocal cord imaging,, to demonstrate the feasibility of performing high-speed vocal cord imaging via the high-speed imaging functions of a high-performance smartphone camera,, and to determine the acceptability of the smartphone-based high-speed vocal cord imaging system for clinical applications in developing countries.
34142978#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A customized smartphone adaptor optical relay was designed for clinical endoscopy using selective laser melting-based 3D printing. A standard laryngoscope was attached to the smartphone adaptor to acquire high-speed vocal cord endoscopic images. Only existing basic functions of the smartphone camera were used for HSDI of the vocal cords. Extracted still frames were observed for qualitative glottal volume and shape. For image processing,, segmented glottal and vocal cord areas were calculated from whole HSDI frames to characterize the amplitude of the vibrations on each side of the glottis,, including the frequency,, edge length,, glottal areas,, base cord,, and lateral phase differences over the acquisition time. The device was incorporated into a preclinical videokymography diagnosis routine to compare functionality.
34142978#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#A smartphone-based HSDI endoscope system can function as a point-of-care clinical diagnostic device. The resulting analysis is of higher quality than that accessible by videostroboscopy and promises comparable quality and greater accessibility than HSDI. In particular,, this system is suitable for use as an accessible diagnostic tool in underdeveloped areas with inadequate medical service infrastructure.

34142978#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Smartphone-based HSDI with the smartphone-endoscope adaptor could achieve 940 frames per second and a resolution of 1280 by 720 frames,, which corresponds to the detection of 3 to 8 frames per vocal cycle at double the spatial resolution of existing devices. The device was used to image the vocal cords of 4 volunteers: 1 healthy individual and 3 patients with vocal cord paralysis,, chronic laryngitis,, or vocal cord polyps. The resultant image stacks were sufficient for most diagnostic purposes. The cost of the device including the smartphone was lower than that of existing HSDI devices. The image processing and analytics demonstrated the successful calculation of relevant diagnostic variables from the acquired images. Patients with vocal pathologies were easily differentiable in the quantitative data.

33124989#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#In Thailand,, children born in government hospitals receive a maternal and child health handbook (MCHH). However,, when a new MCHH edition is released,, those with the previous editions do not have access to the updated information. A mobile app is an appealing platform to fill this gap. We developed a mobile app called "KhunLook" as an interactive electronic MCHH intended to assist parents in child health supervision.
33124989#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study describes the user requirements and development of the KhunLook mobile app,, validity of parents' growth assessments,, and parents' evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the app.
33124989#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Phase 1 was a qualitative study using individual interviews. The interview data were used to revise the prototype. In phase 2,, parents were randomly assigned to assess their children's growth with the app or the MCHH. The outcomes were compared to those of the physician's assessment,, and congruence was determined. In phase 3,, parents evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the app in comparison to the MCHH through a web-based survey.
37184927#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study tested whether a machine learning (ML) model using natural language processing could identify homework assignments in behavioral health sessions. By leveraging this technology,, we sought to develop a more objective and accurate method for detecting the presence of homework in therapy sessions.
37184927#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We analyzed 34,,497 audio-recorded treatment sessions provided in 8 behavioral health care programs via an artificial intelligence (AI) platform designed for therapy provided by Eleos Health. Therapist and client utterances were captured and analyzed via the AI platform. Experts reviewed the homework assigned in 100 sessions to create classifications. Next,, we sampled 4000 sessions and labeled therapist-client microdialogues that suggested homework to train an unsupervised sentence embedding model. This model was trained on 2.83 million therapist-client microdialogues.

33124989#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Four health care providers and 8 parents participated in phase 1. Two themes were identified: (1) the mobile app potentially counters parents' infrequent use of the MCHH with accuracy,, attractiveness,, convenience,, and simplicity,, and (2) health supervision needs to be standard,, up-to-date,, and understandable. KhunLook was publicly launched with a family page and 7 key features: growth and nutrition,, development,, immunizations,, oral health,, reminders for the next appointment,, memories,, and health advice. In phase 2,, 56 parents participated in the growth parameter assessments; 34 were in the App group and 22 in the MCHH group. The outcomes of the growth parameter assessments between parents and physicians in both the App and MCHH groups were not significantly different. The congruence proportions were higher in the App group for weight and head circumference,, but the differences were not statistically significant. In phase 3,, 356 parents from all over Thailand participated in a web-based survey. Parents rated the app feasibility as "very easy to easy" to use at higher proportions than the MCHH in all health assessment domains (growth,, development,, and immunizations) and ease-of-use domains with statistical significance (P<.001). The KhunLook app received a significantly higher mean score (8.59/10) than the MCHH (7.6/10) (P<.001). Most parents (317/356,, 89.0%) preferred the app over MCHH. Further,, 93.5% (333/356) of the parents stated that they would continue to use the app and 96.9% (345/356) would recommend others to use it.
33124989#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#KhunLook,, a Thai mobile app for child health supervision,, was developed,, validated for growth assessments,, and was well accepted for ease-of-use by parents. Further studies should be conducted with a large scale of users,, and the impact of this app on health behaviors and health outcomes must be evaluated.

37184927#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Therapeutic homework is a core element of cognitive and behavioral interventions,, and greater homework compliance predicts improved treatment outcomes. To date,, research in this area has relied mostly on therapists' and clients' self-reports or studies carried out in academic settings,, and there is little knowledge on how homework is used as a treatment intervention in routine clinical care.
37184927#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#-score,, outperforming state-of-the-art ML models. The therapists reviewing the microdialogues agreed in 90% (n=90) of cases on whether or not homework was assigned.

37184927#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of ML and natural language processing to improve the detection of therapeutic homework assignments in behavioral health sessions. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing homework in real-world settings and the potential for AI to support therapists in providing evidence-based care and increasing fidelity with science-backed interventions. By identifying areas where AI can facilitate homework assignments and tracking,, such as reminding therapists to prescribe homework and reducing the charting associated with homework,, we can ultimately improve the overall quality of behavioral health care. Additionally,, our approach can be extended to investigate the impact of homework assignments on therapeutic outcomes,, providing insights into the effectiveness of specific types of homework.

36178715#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Story recall is a simple and sensitive cognitive test that is commonly used to measure changes in episodic memory function in early Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent advances in digital technology and natural language processing methods make this test a candidate for automated administration and scoring. Multiple parallel test stimuli are required for higher-frequency disease monitoring.
36178715#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to develop and validate a remote and fully automated story recall task,, suitable for longitudinal assessment,, in a population of older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD.
36178715#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The "Amyloid Prediction in Early Stage Alzheimer's disease" (AMYPRED) studies recruited participants in the United Kingdom (AMYPRED-UK: NCT04828122) and the United States (AMYPRED-US: NCT04928976). Participants were asked to complete optional daily self-administered assessments remotely on their smart devices over 7 to 8 days. Assessments included immediate and delayed recall of 3 stories from the Automatic Story Recall Task (ASRT),, a test with multiple parallel stimuli (18 short stories and 18 long stories) balanced for key linguistic and discourse metrics. Verbal responses were recorded and securely transferred from participants' personal devices and automatically transcribed and scored using text similarity metrics between the source text and retelling to derive a generalized match score. Group differences in adherence and task performance were examined using logistic and linear mixed models,, respectively. Correlational analysis examined parallel-forms reliability of ASRTs and convergent validity with cognitive tests (Logical Memory Test and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite with semantic processing). Acceptability and usability data were obtained using a remotely administered questionnaire.
32865506#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are chronic conditions,, but the severity of symptomatic experiences and functional impairments vacillate over the course of illness. Developing unobtrusive remote monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of impending symptomatic relapses would allow clinicians to intervene before the patient's condition worsens.

36178715#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Of the 200 participants recruited in the AMYPRED studies,, 151 (75.5%)-78 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 73 MCI or mild AD-engaged in optional remote assessments. Adherence to daily assessment was moderate and did not decline over time but was higher in CU participants (ASRTs were completed each day by 73/106,, 68.9% participants with MCI or mild AD and 78/94,, 83% CU participants). Participants reported favorable task usability: infrequent technical problems,, easy use of the app,, and a broad interest in the tasks. Task performance improved modestly across the week and was better for immediate recall. The generalized match scores were lower in participants with MCI or mild AD (Cohen d=1.54). Parallel-forms reliability of ASRT stories was moderate to strong for immediate recall (mean rho 0.73,, range 0.56-0.88) and delayed recall (mean rho=0.73,, range=0.54-0.86). The ASRTs showed moderate convergent validity with established cognitive tests.
36178715#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The unsupervised,, self-administered ASRT task is sensitive to cognitive impairments in MCI and mild AD. The task showed good usability,, high parallel-forms reliability,, and high convergent validity with established cognitive tests. Remote,, low-cost,, low-burden,, and automatically scored speech assessments could support diagnostic screening,, health care,, and treatment monitoring.

32865506#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this study,, we aim to create the first models,, exclusively using passive sensing data from a smartphone,, to predict behavioral anomalies that could indicate early warning signs of a psychotic relapse.
32865506#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data used to train and test the models were collected during the CrossCheck study. Hourly features derived from smartphone passive sensing data were extracted from 60 patients with SSDs (42 nonrelapse and 18 relapse >1 time throughout the study) and used to train models and test performance. We trained 2 types of encoder-decoder neural network models and a clustering-based local outlier factor model to predict behavioral anomalies that occurred within the 30-day period before a participant's date of relapse (the near relapse period). Models were trained to recreate participant behavior on days of relative health (DRH,, outside of the near relapse period),, following which a threshold to the recreation error was applied to predict anomalies. The neural network model architecture and the percentage of relapse participant data used to train all models were varied.
32865506#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#A total of 20,,137 days of collected data were analyzed,, with 726 days of data (0.037%) within any 30-day near relapse period. The best performing model used a fully connected neural network autoencoder architecture and achieved a median sensitivity of 0.25 (IQR 0.15-1.00) and specificity of 0.88 (IQR 0.14-0.96; a median 108% increase in behavioral anomalies near relapse). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the best performing model to identify behavioral features that had a medium-to-large effect (Cohen d>0.5) in distinguishing anomalies near relapse from DRH among 4 participants who relapsed multiple times throughout the study. Qualitative validation using clinical notes collected during the original CrossCheck study showed that the identified features from our analysis were presented to clinicians during relapse events.
32865506#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Our proposed method predicted a higher rate of anomalies in patients with SSDs within the 30-day near relapse period and can be used to uncover individual-level behaviors that change before relapse. This approach will enable technologists and clinicians to build unobtrusive digital mental health tools that can predict incipient relapse in SSDs.

36793130#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Within preventive Child Health Care (CHC),, the 360°CHILD-profile has been developed. This digital tool visualises and theoretically orders holistic health data in line with the International Classification of Functioning,, Disability and Health. It is anticipated that evaluating the effectiveness of the multifunctional 360°CHILD-profile within the preventive CHC-context is complex. Therefore,, this study aimed at investigating the feasibility of RCT procedures and the applicability of potential outcome measures for assessing the accessibility and transfer of health information.
36793130#ABSTRACT#METHODS#During the first introduction of the 360°CHILD-profile in CHC practice,, a feasibility RCT with an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design was executed. CHC professionals (n=38) recruited parents (n=30) who visited the CHC for their child (age 0-16). Parents were randomised to "care as usual" (n=15) or "care as usual with,, in addition,, the availability of a personalised 360°CHILD-profile during 6 months" (n=15). Quantitative data on RCT feasibility were collected on recruitment,, retention,, response,, compliance rates and outcome data on accessibility and transfer of health information (n=26). Subsequently,, thirteen semi-structured interviews (5 parents,, 8 CHC professionals) and a member check focus group (6 CHC professionals) were performed to further explore and gain a deeper understanding of quantitative findings.
36793130#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Integration of qualitative and quantitative data revealed that the recruitment of parents by CHC professionals was problematic and influenced by organisational factors. The used randomisation strategy,, interventions and measurements were executable within the setting of this specific study. The outcome measures showed skewed outcome data in both groups and a low applicability to measure accessibility and transfer of health information. The study revealed points to reconsider regarding the randomisation and recruitment strategy and measures in the next steps.

36793130#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This mixed methods feasibility study enabled us to gain a broad insight into the feasibility of executing an RCT within the CHC context. Trained research staff should recruit parents instead of CHC professionals. Measures,, potentially for evaluating 360°CHILD-profile's effectiveness,, need further exploration and thorough piloting before proceeding with the evaluation process. Overall findings revealed that executing an RCT within the context of evaluating 360°CHILD-profile's effectiveness in the CHC setting will be much more complex,, time-consuming and costly than expected. Thereby,, the CHC context requires a more complex randomisation strategy than executed during this feasibility study. Alternative designs including mixed methods research must be considered for the next phases of the downstream validation process.

36773349#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) precipitating sudden cardiac arrest (SCD) is among the most frequent causes of death and pose a high burden on public health systems worldwide. The increasing availability of electrophysiological signals collected through conventional methods (e.g. electrocardiography (ECG)) and digital health technologies (e.g. wearable devices) in combination with novel predictive analytics using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) hold potential for personalised predictions of arrhythmic events.
36773349#ABSTRACT#METHODS#This systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis assesses the state-of-the-art of ML/DL models of electrophysiological signals for personalised prediction of malignant VA or SCD,, and studies potential causes of bias (PROSPERO,, reference: CRD42021283464). Five electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Pooled estimates of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary area under the curve (AUROC) were calculated. Meta-analyses were performed separately for studies using publicly available,, ad-hoc datasets,, versus targeted clinical data acquisition. Studies were scored on risk of bias by the PROBAST tool.
36773349#ABSTRACT#FINDINGS#2194 studies were identified of which 46 were included in the systematic review and 32 in the meta-analysis. Pooling of individual models demonstrated a summary AUROC of 0.856 (95% CI 0.755-0.909) for short-term (time-to-event up to 72 h) prediction and AUROC of 0.876 (95% CI 0.642-0.980) for long-term prediction (time-to-event up to years). While models developed on ad-hoc sets had higher pooled performance (AUROC 0.919,, 95% CI 0.867-0.952),, they had a high risk of bias related to the re-use and overlap of small ad-hoc datasets,, choices of ML tool and a lack of external model validation.

36773349#ABSTRACT#INTERPRETATION#ML and DL models appear to accurately predict malignant VA and SCD. However,, wide heterogeneity between studies,, in part due to small ad-hoc datasets and choice of ML model,, may reduce the ability to generalise and should be addressed in future studies.

27558710#ABSTRACT#PURPOSE#Overview of geographically explicit momentary assessment research,, applied to the study of mental health and well-being,, which allows for cross-validation,, extension,, and enrichment of research on place and health.
27558710#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Building on the historical foundations of both ecological momentary assessment and geographic momentary assessment research,, this review explores their emerging synergy into a more generalized and powerful research framework.
27558710#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Geographically explicit momentary assessment methods are rapidly advancing across a number of complimentary literatures that intersect but have not yet converged. Key contributions from these areas reveal tremendous potential for transdisciplinary and translational science.
27558710#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Mobile communication devices are revolutionizing research on mental health and well-being by physically linking momentary experience sampling to objective measures of socio-ecological context in time and place. Methodological standards are not well-established and will be required for transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific inference moving forward.

26543927#ABSTRACT##Recent researches have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting smoking from wearable sensors,, but their performance on real-life smoking lapse detection is unknown. In this paper,, we propose a new model and evaluate its performance on 61 newly abstinent smokers for detecting a first lapse. We use two wearable sensors - breathing pattern from respiration and arm movements from 6-axis inertial sensors worn on wrists. In 10-fold cross-validation on 40 hours of training data from 6 daily smokers,, our model achieves a recall rate of 96.9%,, for a false positive rate of 1.1%. When our model is applied to 3 days of post-quit data from 32 lapsers,, it correctly pinpoints the timing of first lapse in 28 participants. Only 2 false episodes are detected on 20 abstinent days of these participants. When tested on 84 abstinent days from 28 abstainers,, the false episode per day is limited to 1/6.
34342268#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Diet and physical activity (PA) have a major impact on physical and mental health. However,, there is a lack of effective strategies for sustaining these health-protective behaviors. A shift to a microtemporal,, within-person approach is needed to capture dynamic processes underlying eating behavior and PA,, as they change rapidly across minutes or hours and differ among individuals. However,, a tool that captures these microtemporal,, within-person processes in daily life is currently not present.
34342268#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#The APPetite-mobile-app is developed for the ecological momentary assessment of microtemporal,, within-person processes of complex dietary intake,, objectively recorded PA,, and related factors. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the APPetite-mobile-app and the validity of the incorporated APPetite-food record.
34342268#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The APPetite-mobile-app captures dietary intake event-contingently through a food record,, captures PA continuously through accelerometers,, and captures related factors (eg,, stress) signal-contingently through 8 prompts per day. Empirical data on feasibility (n=157),, usability (n=84),, and validity (n=44) were collected within the Eat2beNICE-APPetite-study. Feasibility and usability were examined in healthy participants and psychiatric patients. The relative validity of the APPetite-food record was assessed with a subgroup of healthy participants by using a counterbalanced crossover design. The reference method was a 24-hour recall. In addition,, the energy intake was compared with the total energy expenditure estimated from accelerometry.
35289757#ABSTRACT#METHODS#In this retrospective study,, a publicly available data set of 541 women's health information collected from 10 different hospitals in Kerala,, India,, including PCOS status,, was acquired and used for analysis. We adopted the CatBoost method for classification,, K-fold cross-validation for estimating the performance of models,, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values to explain the importance of each variable. In our subgroup study,, we used k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis to split the data set into 2 distinct BMI subgroups and compared the prediction results as well as the feature importance between the 2 subgroups.

34342268#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Good feasibility,, with compliance rates above 80% for prompts and the accelerometer,, as well as reasonable average response and recording durations (prompt: 2.04 min; food record per day: 17.66 min) and latencies (prompts: 3.16 min; food record: 58.35 min) were found. Usability was rated as moderate,, with a score of 61.9 of 100 on the System Usability Scale. The evaluation of validity identified large differences in energy and macronutrient intake between the two methods at the group and individual levels. The APPetite-food record captured higher dietary intakes,, indicating a lower level of underreporting,, compared with the 24-hour recall. Energy intake was assessed fairly accurately by the APPetite-food record at the group level on 2 of 3 days when compared with total energy expenditure. The comparison with mean total energy expenditure (2417.8 kcal,, SD 410) showed that the 24-hour recall (1909.2 kcal,, SD 478.8) underestimated habitual energy intake to a larger degree than the APPetite-food record (2146.4 kcal,, SD 574.5).
34342268#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The APPetite-mobile-app is a promising tool for capturing microtemporal,, within-person processes of diet,, PA,, and related factors in real time or near real time and is,, to the best of our knowledge,, the first of its kind. First evidence supports the good feasibility and moderate usability of the APPetite-mobile-app and the validity of the APPetite-food record. Future findings in this context will build the foundation for the development of personalized lifestyle modification interventions,, such as just-in-time adaptive interventions.

35442210#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#The Mental Health Quotient (MHQ) is an anonymous web-based assessment of mental health and well-being that comprehensively covers symptoms across 10 major psychiatric disorders,, as well as positive elements of mental function. It uses a novel life impact scale and provides a score to the individual that places them on a spectrum from Distressed to Thriving along with a personal report that offers self-care recommendations. Since April 2020,, the MHQ has been freely deployed as part of the Mental Health Million Project.
35442210#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This paper demonstrates the reliability and validity of the MHQ,, including the construct validity of the life impact scale,, sample and test-retest reliability of the assessment,, and criterion validation of the MHQ with respect to clinical burden and productivity loss.
35442210#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MHQ is a valid and reliable assessment of mental health and well-being when delivered anonymously on the web.

35442210#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Data were taken from the Mental Health Million open-access database (N=179,,238) and included responses from English-speaking adults (aged=18 years) from the United States,, Canada,, the United Kingdom,, Ireland,, Australia,, New Zealand,, South Africa,, Singapore,, India,, and Nigeria collected during 2021. To assess sample reliability,, random demographically matched samples (each 11,,033/179,,238,, 6.16%) were compared within the same 6-month period. Test-retest reliability was determined using the subset of individuals who had taken the assessment twice =3 days apart (1907/179,,238,, 1.06%). To assess the construct validity of the life impact scale,, additional questions were asked about the frequency and severity of an example symptom (feelings of sadness,, distress,, or hopelessness; 4247/179,,238,, 2.37%). To assess criterion validity,, elements rated as having a highly negative life impact by a respondent (equivalent to experiencing the symptom =5 days a week) were mapped to clinical diagnostic criteria to calculate the clinical burden (174,,618/179,,238,, 97.42%). In addition,, MHQ scores were compared with the number of workdays missed or with reduced productivity in the past month (7625/179,,238,, 4.25%).
35442210#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#>0.99). Furthermore,, the aggregate MHQ scores were systematically related to both clinical burden and productivity. At one end of the scale,, 89.08% (8986/10,,087) of those in the Distressed category mapped to one or more disorders and had an average productivity loss of 15.2 (SD 11.2; SEM [standard error of measurement] 0.5) days per month. In contrast,, at the other end of the scale,, 0% (1/24,,365) of those in the Thriving category mapped to any of the 10 disorders and had an average productivity loss of 1.3 (SD 3.6; SEM 0.1) days per month.

35289757#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Artificial intelligence and digital health care have substantially advanced to improve and enhance medical diagnosis and treatment during the prolonged period of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In this study,, we discuss the development of prediction models for the self-diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning techniques.
35289757#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#We aim to develop self-diagnostic prediction models for PCOS in potential patients and clinical providers. For potential patients,, the prediction is based only on noninvasive measures such as anthropomorphic measures,, symptoms,, age,, and other lifestyle factors so that the proposed prediction tool can be conveniently used without any laboratory or ultrasound test results. For clinical providers who can access patients' medical test results,, prediction models using all predictor variables can be adopted to help health providers diagnose patients with PCOS. We compare both prediction models using various error metrics. We call the former model the patient model and the latter,, the provider model throughout this paper.
35289757#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We achieved 81% to 82.5% prediction accuracy of PCOS status without any invasive measures in the patient models and achieved 87.5% to 90.1% prediction accuracy using both noninvasive and invasive predictor variables in the provider models. Among noninvasive measures,, variables including acanthosis nigricans,, acne,, hirsutism,, irregular menstrual cycle,, length of menstrual cycle,, weight gain,, fast food consumption,, and age were more important in the models. In medical test results,, the numbers of follicles in the right and left ovaries and anti-Müllerian hormone were ranked highly in feature importance. We also reported more detailed results in a subgroup study.
35289757#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The proposed prediction models are ultimately expected to serve as a convenient digital platform with which users can acquire pre- or self-diagnosis and counsel for the risk of PCOS,, with or without obtaining medical test results. It will enable women to conveniently access the platform at home without delay before they seek further medical care. Clinical providers can also use the proposed prediction tool to help diagnose PCOS in women.

36087864#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Individuals with cirrhosis with acute decompensation were followed up with CirrhoCare® and compared with contemporaneous matched controls,, managed with standard follow-up. Commercially available monitoring devices were linked to the smartphone CirrhoCare® app,, for daily recording of heart rate,, blood pressure,, weight,, % body water,, cognitive function (CyberLiver Animal Recognition Test [CL-ART] app),, self-reported well-being,, and intake of food,, fluid,, and alcohol. The app had 2-way patient-physician communication. Independent external adjudicators assessed the appropriateness of CirrhoCare®-based decisions.
36087864#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Twenty individuals with cirrhosis were recruited to CirrhoCare® (mean age 59 ± 10 years,, 14 male,, alcohol-related cirrhosis [80%],, mean model for end-stage liver disease-sodium [MELD-Na] score 16.1 ± 4.2) and were not statistically different to 20 contemporaneous controls. Follow-up was 10.1 ± 2.4 weeks. Fifteen individuals showed good engagement (=4 readings/week),, 2 moderate (2-3/week),, and 3 poor (<2/week). In a usability questionnaire,, the median score was =9 for all questions. Five CirrhoCare®-managed individuals had 8 readmissions over a median of 5 (IQR 3.5-11) days,, and none required hospitalisation for >14 days. Sixteen other CirrhoCare®-guided patient contacts were made,, leading to clinical interventions that prevented further progression. Appropriateness was confirmed by adjudicators. Controls had 13 readmissions in 8 individuals,, lasting a median of 7 (IQR 3-15) days with 4 admissions of >14 days. They had 6 unplanned paracenteses compared with 1 in the CirrhoCare® group.
36087864#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#This study demonstrates that CirrhoCare® is feasible for community management of individuals with decompensated cirrhosis with good engagement and clinically relevant alerts to new decompensating events. CirrhoCare®-managed individuals have fewer and shorter readmissions justifying larger controlled clinical trials.

37490331#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Subtle impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) can be a key predictor of disease progression and are considered central to functional independence. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome associated with significant changes in cognitive function and mild impairment in complex functional abilities. The early detection of functional decline through the identification of IADL impairments can aid early intervention strategies. Digital health technology is an objective method of capturing IADL-related behaviors. However,, it is unclear how these IADL-related behaviors have been digitally assessed in the literature and what differences can be observed between MCI and normal aging.

36087864#ABSTRACT#IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS#As the burden of cirrhosis grows worldwide,, increasing demands are being placed on limited healthcare resources,, necessitating the adoption of more sustainable care models that allow for at-home patient management. The CirrhoCare® management system was developed to fill this care gap,, deploying a novel combination of hardware,, apps,, and algorithms,, to monitor and intervene in individuals at risk of new decompensation. This study highlights the possibility of reducing hospital readmissions for cirrhosis by optimising specialist community care,, reducing the need for interventions such as paracentesis,, while providing a more sustainable care pathway that is acceptable to patients. However,, given the pilot and non-randomised nature of this study,, the outcomes require further validation in a larger randomised controlled trial,, to assess both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Moreover,, the data generated will also facilitate data modelling and further research to refine the CirrhoCare® algorithms to increase their detection sensitivity and utility.
37490331#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This review aimed to identify the digital methods and metrics used to assess IADL-related behaviors in people with MCI and report any statistically significant differences in digital endpoints between MCI and normal aging and how these digital endpoints change over time.
37490331#ABSTRACT#METHODS#A total of 16,,099 articles were identified from 8 databases (CINAHL,, Embase,, MEDLINE,, ProQuest,, PsycINFO,, PubMed,, Web of Science,, and Scopus),, out of which 15 were included in this review. The included studies must have used continuous remote digital measures to assess IADL-related behaviors in adults characterized as having MCI by clinical diagnosis or assessment. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
37490331#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Ambient technology was the most commonly used digital method to assess IADL-related behaviors in the included studies (14/15,, 93%),, with passive infrared motion sensors (5/15,, 33%) and contact sensors (5/15,, 33%) being the most prevalent types of methods. Digital technologies were used to assess IADL-related behaviors across 5 domains: activities outside of the home,, everyday technology use,, household and personal management,, medication management,, and orientation. Other recognized domains-culturally specific tasks and socialization and communication-were not assessed. Of the 79 metrics recorded among 11 types of technologies,, 65 (82%) were used only once. There were inconsistent findings around differences in digital IADL endpoints across the cognitive spectrum,, with limited longitudinal assessment of how they changed over time.
37490331#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Despite the broad range of metrics and methods used to digitally assess IADL-related behaviors in people with MCI,, several IADLs relevant to functional decline were not studied. Measuring multiple IADL-related digital endpoints could offer more value than the measurement of discrete IADL outcomes alone to observe functional decline. Key recommendations include the development of suitable core metrics relevant to IADL-related behaviors that are based on clinically meaningful outcomes to aid the standardization and further validation of digital technologies against existing IADL measures. Increased longitudinal monitoring is necessary to capture changes in digital IADL endpoints over time in people with MCI.

35076409#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Wearable devices hold great promise,, particularly for data generation for cutting-edge health research,, and their demand has risen substantially in recent years. However,, there is a shortage of aggregated insights into how wearables have been used in health research.
35076409#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#In this review,, we aim to broadly overview and categorize the current research conducted with affordable wearable devices for health research.
35076409#ABSTRACT#METHODS#We performed a scoping review to understand the use of affordable,, consumer-grade wearables for health research from a population health perspective using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. A total of 7499 articles were found in 4 medical databases (PubMed,, Ovid,, Web of Science,, and CINAHL). Studies were eligible if they used noninvasive wearables: worn on the wrist,, arm,, hip,, and chest; measured vital signs; and analyzed the collected data quantitatively. We excluded studies that did not use wearables for outcome assessment and prototype studies,, devices that cost >€500 (US $570),, or obtrusive smart clothing.
35076409#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#Wearables showed an increasingly diverse field of application such as COVID-19 prediction,, fertility tracking,, heat-related illness,, drug effects,, and psychological interventions; they also included underrepresented populations,, such as individuals with rare diseases. There is a lack of research on wearable devices in low-resource contexts. Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic,, we see a shift toward more large-sized,, web-based studies where wearables increased insights into the developing pandemic,, including forecasting models and the effects of the pandemic. Some studies have indicated that big data extracted from wearables may potentially transform the understanding of population health dynamics and the ability to forecast health trends.

35076409#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#We included 179 studies using 189 wearable devices covering 10,,835,,733 participants. Most studies were observational (128/179,, 71.5%),, conducted in 2020 (56/179,, 31.3%) and in North America (94/179,, 52.5%),, and 93% (10,,104,,217/10,,835,,733) of the participants were part of global health studies. The most popular wearables were fitness trackers (86/189,, 45.5%) and accelerometer wearables,, which primarily measure movement (49/189,, 25.9%). Typical measurements included steps (95/179,, 53.1%),, heart rate (HR; 55/179,, 30.7%),, and sleep duration (51/179,, 28.5%). Other devices measured blood pressure (3/179,, 1.7%),, skin temperature (3/179,, 1.7%),, oximetry (3/179,, 1.7%),, or respiratory rate (2/179,, 1.1%). The wearables were mostly worn on the wrist (138/189,, 73%) and cost <€200 (US $228; 120/189,, 63.5%). The aims and approaches of all 179 studies revealed six prominent uses for wearables,, comprising correlations-wearable and other physiological data (40/179,, 22.3%),, method evaluations (with subgroups; 40/179,, 22.3%),, population-based research (31/179,, 17.3%),, experimental outcome assessment (30/179,, 16.8%),, prognostic forecasting (28/179,, 15.6%),, and explorative analysis of big data sets (10/179,, 5.6%). The most frequent strengths of affordable wearables were validation,, accuracy,, and clinical certification (104/179,, 58.1%).

32706730#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Existing mental health assessment tools provide an incomplete picture of symptom experience and create ambiguity,, bias,, and inconsistency in mental health outcomes. Furthermore,, by focusing on disorders and dysfunction,, they do not allow a view of mental health and well-being across a general population.
32706730#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#This study aims to demonstrate the outcomes and validity of a new web-based assessment tool called the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ),, which is designed for the general population. The MHQ covers the complete breadth of clinical mental health symptoms and also captures healthy mental functioning to provide a complete profile of an individual's mental health from clinical to thriving.
35583921#ABSTRACT#METHODS#As a part of the requirements analysis preceding the pAItient project,, this qualitative study explored physician perspectives and expectations regarding the use of data derived from daily patient care in AI-based solutions. Semistructured,, guide-based,, and problem-centered interviews were audiorecorded,, deidentified,, transcribed verbatim,, and analyzed inductively in a thematically structured approach.
35583921#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The interviewed physicians reported they would agree to use real-world care data to support the development of AI-based solutions with a clear benefit for daily patient care. Joint ventures with third-party entities were viewed critically and should focus on care optimization and patient benefits rather than financial interests.

32706730#ABSTRACT#METHODS#The MHQ was developed based on the coding of symptoms assessed in 126 existing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-based psychiatric assessment tools as well as neuroscientific criteria laid out by Research Domain Criteria to arrive at a comprehensive set of semantically distinct mental health symptoms and attributes. These were formulated into questions on a 9-point scale with both positive and negative dimensions and developed into a web-based tool that takes approximately 14 min to complete. As its output,, the assessment provides overall MHQ scores as well as subscores for 6 categories of mental health that distinguish clinical and at-risk groups from healthy populations based on a nonlinear scoring algorithm. MHQ items were also mapped to the DSM fifth edition (DSM-5),, and clinical diagnostic criteria for 10 disorders were applied to the MHQ outcomes to cross-validate scores labeled at-risk and clinical. Initial data were collected from 1665 adult respondents to test the tool.
32706730#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Scores in the normal healthy range spanned from 0 to 200 for the overall MHQ,, with an average score of approximately 100 (SD 45),, and from 0 to 100 with average scores between 48 (SD 21) and 55 (SD 22) for subscores in each of the 6 mental health subcategories. Overall,, 2.46% (41/1665) and 13.09% (218/1665) of respondents were classified as clinical and at-risk,, respectively,, with negative scores. Validation against DSM-5 diagnostic criteria showed that 95% (39/41) of those designated clinical were positive for at least one DSM-5-based disorder,, whereas only 1.14% (16/1406) of those with a positive MHQ score met the diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder.
32706730#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSIONS#The MHQ provides a fast,, easy,, and comprehensive way to assess population mental health and well-being; identify at-risk individuals and subgroups; and provide diagnosis-relevant information across 10 disorders.

35583921#ABSTRACT#BACKGROUND#Development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in health care is proceeding rapidly. The sharing and release of real-world data are key practical issues surrounding the implementation of AI solutions into existing clinical practice. However,, data derived from daily patient care are necessary for initial training,, and continued data supply is needed for the ongoing training,, validation,, and improvement of AI-based solutions. Data may need to be shared across multiple institutions and settings for the widespread implementation and high-quality use of these solutions. To date,, solutions have not been widely implemented in Germany to meet the challenge of providing a sufficient data volume for the development of AI-based technologies for research and third-party entities. The Protected Artificial Intelligence Innovation Environment for Patient-Oriented Digital Health Solutions (pAItient) project aims to meet this challenge by creating a large data pool that feeds on the donation of data derived from daily patient care. Prior to building this data pool,, physician perspectives regarding data donation for AI-based solutions should be studied.
35583921#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Interviews (N=8) with a mean duration of 24 (SD 7.8) minutes were conducted with 6 general practitioners and 2 hospital-based physicians. The mean participant age was 54 (SD 14.1; range 30-74) years,, with an average experience as a physician of 25 (SD 13.9; range 1-45) years. Self-rated affinity toward modern information technology varied from very high to low (5-point Likert scale: mean 3.75,, SD 1.1). All participants reported they would support the development of AI-based solutions in research contexts by donating deidentified data derived from daily patient care if subsequent data use was made transparent to them and their patients and the benefits for patient care were clear. Contributing to care optimization and efficiency were cited as motivation for potential data donation. Concerns regarding workflow integration (time and effort),, appropriate deidentification,, and the involvement of third-party entities with economic interests were discussed. The donation of data in reference to psychosomatic treatment needs was viewed critically.

36419480#ABSTRACT#OBJECTIVE#With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based health interventions,, systemic racism remains a concern as these advancements are frequently developed without race-specific data analysis or validation. To evaluate the potential utility of an AI-based cardiovascular diseases (CVD) screening tool in an under-resourced African-American cohort,, we reviewed the AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data of participants enrolled in a community-based clinical trial as a proof-of-concept ancillary study for community-based screening.
36419480#ABSTRACT#METHODS#Enrollees completed cardiovascular testing including standard 12-lead ECG and a limited echocardiogram (TTE). All ECGs were analyzed using previously published institution-based AI algorithms. AI-ECG predictions were generated for age,, sex,, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Diagnostic accuracy of the AI-ECG for decreased LVEF and sex was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients.
36419480#ABSTRACT#RESULTS#Fifty-four participants completed both an ECG and TTE (mean age 55 years [range 31-87 years]; 66.7% female). All participants were in sinus rhythm,, and the median LVEF of the cohort was 60-65%. The AI-ECG for decreased LVEF demonstrated excellent performance with an AUC of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.708-1); sensitivity=50% (95% CI 9.5-90.5%; n=1/2) and specificity=96% (95% CI 86.8-98.9%; n=49/51). The AI-ECG for participant sex demonstrated similar performance with AUC of 0.944 (95% CI 0.891-0.998); sensitivity=100% (95% CI 82.4-100.0%; n=18/18) and specificity=77.8% (95% CI 61.9-88.3%; n=28/36). The AI-ECG predicted mean age was 55 years (range 26.9-72.6 years) with a strong correlation to actual age (R=0.769; p<0.001).
36419480#ABSTRACT#CONCLUSION#Our analyses of previously developed AI-ECG algorithms for prediction of age,, sex,, and decreased LVEF demonstrated reliable performance in this community-based,, African-American cohort. This novel,, community-centric delivery of AI could provide valuable screening resources and appropriate referrals for early detection of highly-morbid CVD for under-resourced patient populations.
