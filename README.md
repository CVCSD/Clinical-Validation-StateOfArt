## Analysis

For bibliometric and visual analysis, we included all retrieved articles that met the previous criteria. 
The following bibliometric indicators were extracted from each paper and imported for in-depth analyses: publication year, journal name, journal country, abstract, keywords, impact factor, quartiles, and categories. 
A descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the frequencies of these variables. 
Additionally, we performed graphical analyses, generated a Word cloud illustrating the distribution of keywords and mesh terms, and assessed frequency patterns based on the region and country of the first author. 
We identified variables related to the study design and evaluation domains through word searches in the title, abstract, and keywords. A list of synonymous words used for design and domain categorisation. 
Descriptive bivariate table. 
The data management and analysis requiere to install the follow R packages: dplyr, lubridate compareGroups, ggplot2, wordcloud2, stringi webshot2, htmlwidgets, flextable, FormatGe, table1, maps & countrycode. 

FormatGe is a proprietary package that needs to be installed from GitHub using the following command: `devtools::install_github("USR-DAPCAT/FormatGe")`
